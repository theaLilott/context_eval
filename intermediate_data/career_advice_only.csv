jobs,passed over for promotion,Got passed over for a promotion I thought was guaranteed and I'm feeling lost,"I've been at my marketing job for almost 3 years and genuinely thought I was next in line for the team lead position that opened up last month. My manager had been giving me more responsibilities, I've never missed a deadline and my performance reviews have always been solid. Yesterday I found out that they hired someone externally instead. My boss said I was ""close"" but they wanted someone with more leadership experience. The thing is like how am I supposed to get leadership experience if no one will give me the chance? I'm not sure if I should stick around and hope something else opens up or start looking elsewhere. Part of me feels like maybe they just don't see me as management material and never will. I've just been messing around on work like I'm just playing on grizzly's quest without really caring cuz these guys dont appreciate what I'm doing. Anyone been in a similar situation?

jobs,passed over for promotion,Passed over for a promotion,"Basically what the title says. I was passed over for a promotion to a position that I have been working extra hours for and extra duties for, for several years. Not sure if I should leave the company AFTER finding a new job (if that’s even possible in this market), or if I should just stay and hope they promote me in the next several years. In order to expand my family I will need to make more than I am making now, so I feel like I’m on a biological clock to make this happen. I also don’t know how to face my coworkers and boss with grace. I feel so let down and embarrassed. 

For context they absolutely knew I was gunning for this position (have made it very clear in discussions with management), and gave it to someone who has less seniority than me. This makes me think it is either a perception or performance issue on my end. Part of me thinks if they are not going to prioritize my career, then maybe this isn’t the right place for me.

jobs,passed over for promotion,Passed over for promotion.. what’s my next move?,"I (27F) work in industry for the largest international company in our market as an accountant. I have an MBA and have been at this company for two years. I recently interviewed for a senior accountant position  and was told today I wasn’t being offered one of the two open positions even though per their feedback the managers and senior managers that interviewed me sang my praises, I have all the markings of a leader, and I have only received positive feedback. I am also the most senior staff accountant and have experience in everything our team touches. The reasoning? They just feel that “I’m not ready.” 

Here’s my dilemma. I love this company. I have issues with the management in our department but outside of that I couldn’t imagine working anywhere else but I just don’t make enough money for my skills anymore. The same time I applied for the senior role, a recruiter reached out on LinkedIn and wants to put me in front of two companies for positions that would bring in $20k more than I currently make.

jobs,passed over for promotion,"Unpopular opinion: ""Just learn a trade"" isn't good advice for young men seeking stable, future-proof careers","I graduated from high school in 2015. At that time, an MBA still meant something, STEM was taking off as an surefire career path for young adults, and the trades, particularly in skilled fields, were a rock-solid way to secure one's future. Computer science and software development were \*really\* taking off at this time, too.

I was just starting college and had no idea what I wanted to do with my life, beyond what I liked talking about (history, policy) and began working on my BA in Political Science - then on to my MA right after COVID hit. I was warned this was not a particularly good career path and that I should stick to a ""hard"" science or a trade. Quite ironic, given what would happen to those fields...

Roughly ten years have passed since, and the labor market has dramatically shifted.... and not necessarily in the favor of anyone trying to get going on the American Dream. An MBA is just there to check a box, most STEM fields were crushed by outsourcing, and most people are aware of the beating Computer Science and Tech fields have taken since 2022, with endless layoffs in the last 3 years.

The situation is so bad, in fact, that I am aware of numerous cases of STEM graduates with Masters in Applied Engineering or Engineering Physics being told that their degrees are too ""generalized"". They finished their degrees with 3.9X GPAs, did internships with prestigious companies or government agencies, and are now flailing around and living at home because they're being rejected from every job they apply to. My younger brother recently finished his BS in Electrical Engineering and isn't using his degree despite possessing near-savant levels of knowledge of the field, instead, he's doing B2B sales with a company that focuses on electrical engineering. My sister-in-law, working on her MS in Aerospace Engineering is crushing 80 hour weeks between interning, writing in journals, and just going to classes because she can see the writing on the wall.

So, with so many ""safe"" fields destroyed by economic upheaval, immigration, automation (or the promise of automation) and greed, what do we have left?

Healthcare, trades, and the military.

And I’m going to say something that should be obvious to anyone who took sixth-grade economics: *no field is safe* when supply explodes and demand doesn’t. Oversaturation kills opportunity. It doesn’t matter how “in demand” a field is today - it can become obsolete tomorrow, just like the others.

Let's focus on the trades for a moment. Lots of flashy headlines about supposed shortages, claiming six figures for skilled tradesmen which rarely seem to pan out, but focusing just on job availability, what do you think will happen to these fields if five, ten, fifteen million underemployed young men give up on trying to find a job in their degree field and swing into the trades?

Will there be enough demand for plumbers, HVAC specialists, and welders in 2030 to support ten million guys around the country all pivoting into these fields at the same time? It's possible. Will wages remain unaffected? Absolutely not.

Wages will collapse. That’s how markets work.

The primary incentive for going into the trades right now is the money. What happens when wages flatten in these fields due to an oversaturation of skilled workers, as has happened to the humanities, then business, then STEM, then tech?

Right now in central Florida, HVAC specialists are paid an average of $22.60 an hour. This isn't six figures, and it's not even halfway there unless you're working more than eight hours or over the weekend. Wages will not keep up with inflation and the rising cost of living if, suddenly, you aren't the only contractor in town, but there are three other guys who have the exact same credentials.

The same is true of the military, to an extent. The recruiting incentives will vanish and the standards for retention and promotion will skyrocket if the economy gets bad enough and the officer corps becomes a dumping ground for unemployed men with degrees.

I fear that ""Just learn a trade"" will go the way of ""just learn to code"" and ""just get a degree"" very soon and it will have a catastrophic effect on our economy and quality of life.",511,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1krhv56/unpopular_opinion_just_learn_a_trade_isnt_good/,1747779368.0,TRPSock97,1krhv56,advice_seeking

A promotion that she was hiring for opened up in our team. The other (very capable) person internally applying got the role. 

I’m feeling quite lost and like I’m not sure what to do next. What would you do? Stick it out or side step to hopefully somewhere more interesting? 

Current job pays well, and has great people, but aren’t investing in marketing so no new roles are showing up at the moment. The work itself is a little boring, but again, they pay well. 

If I side step externally I’ll probably get the same salary or a decrease, the work could potentially be more interesting, and who knows maybe they would promote me soon after. There’s a bit of unknown here in the people & promotion opportunities.

jobs,passed over for promotion,Passed over for internal promotion ,"Title says it. I'm on the IT field, been with the company 2 1/2 years (company is 4 yrs old).My boss who is a director is leaving, I was encouraged to apply by him and other execs. I was told by the HM I would go through the same process for compliance reasons. This should have been a flag. 

My boss who is leaving is very much a unicorn. Alot of experience in cloud architecture and cyber security, which is what they are looking for. I have a ton of security and management, a little weak in the cloud but understand most concepts. And progressively learning about it. 

All the teams I work with are great people, I have no tension with anyone, including execs and stakeholders. I've built the security program from a muddy puddle to something pretty darn good. 

I haven't gotten the ""official word"" but through back channels I've been told I am rejected. Before you ask, the back channels are pretty accurate. They are looking outside the company as no one else has wanted the director role. Basically I thought I stood a really good chance with my experience, my inside knowledge of projects and teams, etc. 

The promotion would have been good for my family and our future provided the company stays afloat (that's another story which I'm sure the potential candidates aren't being told). 

So I feel demoralized and shafted a little. I know it's natural but there sure isn't any drive to excel now. Normally I'm a hard worker that goes above and beyond. Take it up on myself to handle 24/7 on call, and really go out of my way to help other employees. 

I know how I am and my drive will suffer. Especially since I know I'll be training the new person on our security practice. Im at a point in my career where most security people with my experience and age are CISOs, directors, etc. I know that's the direction I want. 

So I think I'm going to take the middle road. Do my ""9-5"" take some of the 200+ hours of PTO I have, and look for another job. The scheduleing of PTO will probably tip them off since I never take it. 

I'm just ranting, but clearly I'm not wanted to move up, which being a startup, there isn't much higher I'm going anyway. ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1hk47s4/passed_over_for_internal_promotion/,1734891472.0,VirusGh0st,1hk47s4,advice_seeking
jobs,passed over for promotion,"Passed over for promotion, feeling defeated and stuck","Let me give you a little back story on the job. I work for a public utility in a very rural area. My title is Engineering Technician step 5. Our main job duties are revising electrical, mechanical and civil drawings in our records that are usually marked up by engineers or electricians when we remove, revise or update equipment. We also do a lot of visual inspections and alignment/settlement surveys on hydro electric dams we own and operate. I have been here for 10 years, I was hired as an apprentice, the pay for a step 5 is very good for the area ($49 hr).  The job is also very low stress, which I like, but I feel like I need a new challenge, and this promotion would have provided that.

Our Lead or Senior technician just took another job with in the utility, before she left she taught me the main functions of her job which was basically document and records handling. Everytime we complete work on drawing we have a specific way of filing it in our records system that complies with state and federal guidelines. For the last 3 months I was basically doing all of this. There were 3 of us in the department that qualified for the senior position. Mine was the last interview of the day. I was informed today that I did not get the position. I enquire as to what held me back or was the determining factor. My supervisor told me he liked the other candidates ""vision"" for the department and it aligned more with what he had in mind going forward.

So now I have to teach this new Senior the meat and potatos of his new position and go back to doing what I was doing 3 months prior. I ended up taking PL the rest of the day and am taking tomorrow off as well (we work 4-10s) so I can have a few days to just process my disappointment and frustration.

I am still 20 years from retirement, but 10 years in to state pension, along with a 401k that the company matches and good pay for the area. But I still feel so defeated and stuck. I don't know how I could take the very niche and specific skills we use here and find a job that pays the same elsewhere. I don't know if I am looking for advice or just venting at this point. I would be curious to hear how others have handled similar situations.

I did communicate this to my supervisor and he said he wishes he could incentivize me more but his hands are somewhat tied since my position is a union position (and hes right, the union is very black and white).",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1fuvxne/passed_over_for_promotion_feeling_defeated_and/,1727917279.0,Smooth_Plankton9054,1fuvxne,advice_seeking

jobs,passed over for promotion,Am I unhirable now?,"I was doing really well in my career 6 years ago, and then in March 2020 the pandemic happened. I was furloughed then rehired and pseudo promoted to a different side of the same department, but the job was dead end despite paying low 6 figures. 

Then about a year later a shiny tech company recruited me and I got a massive pay bump. Literally about 3 days into the job I realized that the job itself was super wrong for me, but the pay was amazing and I had a great relationship with my manager and the team I managed so I stayed on. 

Fast forward about 1.5 years, and the great boss I had got fired by his boss, who disliked my nice boss and hated me. This guy (who hates me) became my boss and the writing was on the wall for me. I did everything I can to get on his good side but I got let go (fired!). It took me 3 months to find my next job which was massively lower in salary but since I wanted to get a job, I took it. 

This new job was constantly overworking me, my boss was again pretty toxic (she doesn't speak English all too well and she is best friends with the founder of the company who are all from a different country so they prefer to communicate in that language) and it became pretty apparently that unless you share a language or religion with them, you're not going to really have too much of a chance at success there. About 6 months into the job (where I HAVE the metrics to show how much I improved the place) I sensed that I was going to be replaced. Meanwhile there was also a newly hired ""talent"" recruiter who was making life hell for everyone. She wasn't my boss but she acted like it, she was micro managing me and demanded responses to slack and email that she'd send at odd times, like 11.46 pm on a Friday night. 

Sure enough, I was ""let go"" from the job once their audit period was over. It's now been 7 months of job searching, and I am wondering if there's some kind of conspiracy keeping me locked out of the job market, or whether my resume is legit that bad. I have 16+ years of experience, I have the technical skills and the people management skills, yet somehow I keep getting rejected without so much as a recruiter screening. I did make it through 7 rounds and a take home assignment at one company only to be told that they will keep looking (2 months later the company is STILL looking!!!).

jobs,workplace discrimination,Budget 100k-150k got offered 90k,"I’ve been interviewing for almost a month now at a startup of 27 people for a compliance role and got the offer today at 90k. They’re introducing trading surveilence and that’s why I was called in for an interview because I have 5 years of trading experience and foundational knowledge in compliance but no direct experience in compliance. I know the lack of direct experience means I won’t get offered as much but I wasn’t expecting an offer below the range?? 

Every round of interview I’ve had they said how impressed they were with me and how much I knew about compliance but not enough to give me an offer in the range? I’m a bit sad I have to admit. I’m extremely grateful but damn I wasn’t even worth offering within their range, damn! It’s about and hour 20 minute commute to the city, it’s a hybrid role I met the team they were great I wasn’t expecting that offer I have to admit. Any advice on how to go about this??I don’t want to lose the offer but I’m not sure I want to accept this. Thanks in advance! 

Edit 1: I just got the official offer letter, 90k base, no equity or bonus either at the moment but they said I may be eligible next year in march. Good insurance but I have fully covered insurance now. Also, they mentioned there’s basically no clear growth trajectory that’s why I really want to negotiate. If I’m in this same role in 5 years I want to know I’m at least paid to make up for that. So for me given no equity or bonus I feel I need to negotiate at least within their range since there’s no other incentive to make up for it. 

Thanks for all the advice I truly appreciate it. Couple things, I’m a female lol if that makes a difference, it doesn’t to me but I know how the workplace is sometimes but I don’t feel like it’s that type of discrimination honestly. And for those of you saying I shouldn’t complain about 90k, it truly honestly isn’t about the money it’s about the principle. If I had an offer with a range of 500k-550k and got offered 490k, or had an offer range of 20k-30k and got offered 15k I’d react the same every time. I expected mid lower end I did not expect below by 10k I feel like accepting this without negotiating would give the impression I have no back bone and don’t know my worth which is just not the case.

jobs,workplace discrimination,Subjective performance requirements are not legal,"This was a very expensive experience, so I wanted to share this with people. I was put on a ""performance improvement program (PiP)"" earlier, but the objectives were things like ""maintain focus on prioritized work"", ""provide relevant information during meetings"", being ""accountable"", not exhibiting ""resistance""

All of these performance requirements were actually unfulfillable, because no matter how well I did at the stated objectives in the next 3 months (I was decent at the job), this manager would always mark me as having fallen short. Regardless. I believe it was actually workplace discrimination wrapped in a ""performance plan.""

So I went to a lawyer, who had a look. Here is what the lawyer wrote me for advice:

>Employers have the right to require employees to meet certain performance expectations, but such demands must be reasonable. Employers can also utilize performance improvement plans (PIP), but they must meet certain requirements before a PIP can be relied on to take disciplinary action against an employee.

>Courts have established those requirements as being: (1) the employer has established *reasonable* *objective* standards of performance; (2) the employee failed to meet those standards; (3) the employee was properly warned that failing to meet those standards risked losing their position; and (4) the employee was given reasonable time and opportunity to correct the situation.

jobs,workplace discrimination,Should I stay in my current position or take a new one?,"Hey Reddit, I need some advice. I'm currently working in a work-from-home role three days a week, earning $43 an hour, with occasional in-person requirements from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. However, I'm being treated poorly—management is dismissive of my concerns, I’ve been placed on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) but denied the opportunity to complete it, and I’ve also experienced discrimination at work. There’s a lot of gossip influencing management decisions, and I feel excluded from opportunities. (More details in the comments if you're interested.)

Honestly, at my current job, I barely do any work—I have almost no workload or responsibilities due to management managing me out.

But I’ve been offered another job, but I’m torn. Here’s how they compare:

Current Job (Ends June 2025, Little to No Work):

✅ $43/hr, mostly work from home ✅ 3 WFH days, some in-person work ✅ Minimal workload—barely any work to do ❌ Toxic work environment (bullying, exclusion, lack of support) ❌ Management placed me on a PIP but won’t let me complete it ❌ Discrimination & workplace gossip affecting my treatment ❌ No support for my TAFE Certificate, unwilling to sign of on eorkplacemnet hours (which I need to complete)

New Job (Ends December 2025, Actual Work Required):

✅ $40.05/hr ✅ Hybrid role (1 day in-office, 1 day on the road, 1 WFH) ✅ Supports my TAFE Certificate and willing to sign workplacement hours ✅ Longer contract until December 2025 ❌ 8 AM - 5 PM schedule (longer hours) ❌ Actual workload and responsibilities (unlike my current job) ❌ Based in the city (which I hate)

So my choice is between: 1️⃣ A toxic, unsupportive job with no workload but decent pay and WFH perks (ending in June 2025). 2️⃣ A more structured, supportive job with an actual workload, but lower pay, longer hours, and a location I dislike (ending in December 2025).

Would you stay in the easier, toxic job or switch to the more demanding but supportive job? Any advice is appreciated!",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1ikzvsr/should_i_stay_in_my_current_position_or_take_a/,1739054670.0,PaimonsLair,1ikzvsr,advice_seeking

I was told in my offer letter that there may be a drug screening for my position, but I haven't gotten the email I was supposed to get to schedule it. Since then, I have done my I-9 and signed other paperwork, and have begun the process of completing other required computer trainings. Under their harrassment and discrimination section, I found this (see the red text in the photo). Does this mean if I test positive for THC on a potential drug test, they will not terminate my employment?

jobs,workplace discrimination,"Might employers consider 401(k) balances when planning a RIF/layoffs?
","Hey everyone, I've been thinking about employer-sponsored retirement accounts, specifically 401(k)s, and how employers have full visibility into the account's balances, transfers, contribution rates, allocations, etc. This got me wondering about a way in which this could possible be used in the case of RIF planning and selection

I think everybody is aware to some extent that age discrimination is an issue in the workplace, just look at the multiple ongoing IBM lawsuits where they're accused of systemic age discrimination. But I'm wondering if there's a hidden factor at play that no one really talks about.

**Here's my theory: What if companies are partially using 401(k) balances to help decide who to lay off?** Not explicitly or on paper of course (obviously illegal), but as an internal psychological factor that helps decision-makers rationalize their choices. Like, ""Yeah, Bill is 67 and we hate to let him go, but he has 2 million in his 401(k). He'll be fine...""

It would be nearly impossible to detect or prove if this is happening, yet it could serve as a perfect way to maintain plausible deniability, help executives feel less guilty about layoffs (""at least these folks have a retirement""), and reduce potential backlash since those employees with retirement accounts don't feel like the rug is being pulled out from under them. They have another rug of their own, so to speak, and might feel ""better equipped"" to handle job loss and raise less of a fuss. It's effectively like forcing these folks to take an ""early retirement""

I'm wondering if any HR professionals, employment lawyers, or people who've been involved in corporate layoffs have thoughts on this. Have you seen patterns that might suggest this happens? It seems like the perfect cover for age discrimination - impossible to prove, easy to rationalize, and ostensibly humane What do you all think? Is this happening behind the scenes in corporate America?

**TL;DR** Employers can see everything in your 401(k) account (balances, contributions, etc.). Could they be secretly using this info during layoffs to target older employees with large retirement savings? It would be impossible to prove, helps them justify age discrimination (""they'll be fine, they have savings""), and gives perfect plausible deniability. Has anyone in HR or employment law seen this happening?",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1hiajlr/might_employers_consider_401k_balances_when/,1734664432.0,senitel10,1hiajlr,advice_seeking

jobs,ageism boss,“But did you try reaching out to the HM directly?” Is absolutely horrible advice,"So, position advertised. And despite my experience of knowing how these things end up, I invest time to start doing my research. In case you are wondering, have spent 15+ years in this function and more and all the required experience and qualifications including language to do this job which is why i applied. This is not a “candidates don’t even read the job description and waste our time by sending in unqualified CV’s” situation. 

Post on LI says “hey reach out to me” from both the recruiter and then reposted by the Fukin VP of marketing who this role reports into. Sounds so exciting and uplifting right? Yes, Yes of course.. connect , apply, reach out 

So I start to ✔️ all the boxes that need to be ticked as per advice from everyone in a job today. 

1) send a personal message to both the VP and talent lead- message read, profile checked ZERO ACKNOWLEDGMENT .

2) apply with a tailored CV, highlighting career wins specifically in line with role expectations. 

3) write a personalized cover letter addressed to them and explain why I would be a good fit and what my accomplishments in career have been which specifically answers the brief and why I would like to join their brand and despite seniority, I am very comfortable and confident in doing well in this role etc 

4) send a second message to both asswipes on LI, and sound positive as F! Because I am hoping for a Fukin conversation at the very least 

5) reach out to the senior recruiter and also two others in my networks network who know the sales and engineering bosses. So that’s 3 additional people through references explaining that they know me and acknowledge my skills are suited for the role

So basically I did the whole “apply, reach out, connect” and neither of them acknowledge anything. 

Exactly 6 hours after applying. I get a generic Fukin rejection. 

So, once again, to everyone who says.. did you try……… I have done this to death. There is no fukin formula. **Ageism is real and so is discrimination**

It’s not a case of ATS rejecting. It’s specifically a human being who would be your eventual boss, looking at it and saying nah!  

I have seen HM’s get on here and bitch and moan about how candidates don’t read JD’s and how HR is not doing their job and cutting candidates who are qualified etc etc and advising send it directly or get in touch directly and things will be Fukin amazing etc etc. well here’s as good an example as any. **Done that and still rejected**

And I will take this one step further.

I will post an update in three months on who they hired for this role. And it will be textbook example to showcase discrimination.

jobs,ageism boss,My boss is making work impossible and I need to leave asap,"I genuinely need some help here because I am so sick of putting up with what’s going on. I work for a company with a large office in a town a couple towns away from me. We have an office where I live where I work with my supervisor. It is just me (21F) and her (50F). I was hired back in November 2024 as an assistant to her. Everything went fine for the first month or two before I noticed issues. However, I realized really quickly that my day and mood depended on how she was feeling or how her meetings with clients went. I’ve been documenting things since the beginning of this year because I want people in my company to know (when I do leave) that this has been happening. I should also preface before I get into it that I have talked to a higher up at this company about all of this. I was told to go to them when I started because I was warned by multiple people that I would have a very difficult time working with her (at one point I was straight up told that I was hired because my supervisor thought she could push me around easier). I was told by that higher up that they would tell our boss and get back to me within the week but its been a couple of months and I haven’t heard anything.

My first glimpse of issues with her started when I started getting thrown into tasks with little to no training. I would be forced to call or speak to someone about an issue that they were having and would have to answer to the best of my knowledge. When I would answer the question wrong on the phone, i would be waived at and looked at like I had made a crazy misstep. I would then be told that I had “fucked up” and that I wasnt ready for that. This happened multiple times over my first few months and still happens to this day if I haven’t been properly prepped. 

Going off of that, asking questions in general has been highly discouraged. It's either that she’s too busy or just doesn’t feel like it. I’ve tried asking other people in our big office but I’m then told how “stupid” or “dense” those people are and that I shouldn’t be asking them anything. She’s called women at the firm “c**ts” when they do something she doesn’t like.

This hasn’t happened as much recently but when I was a couple months in, she found out she had kids my age. She kind of latched onto that and made sure to either tell every client that I was “ so young” and “hired cause I was tech savvy OR use it as an excuse as to why I wasn’t understanding things I had never been shown how to do/trained on. She would often say “I should have known you would mess that up” and things to the same vein. She at one point straight up said “you’re not allowed to forget things. I am. It’s called ageism.”

Today, I walked into work after an accidental 4 day weekend. I got sick on friday and called in (mind you, this is the ONLY TIME I have called in sick) and had taken monday off months ago to see my sibling. I was then met with “I was really pissed you called in. It really fucked me over…it messed up my vacation.” She didn’t have a vacation that was ruined. She had a hard week and didn’t want to come in. I physically could not come in (I have a chronic disorder that leaves me incapacitated for hours when it flares up) and tried my best to give her some notice. This really left me feeling helpless about this whole situation.

I NEED to leave this job. I cannot do it anymore and the things listed above are the tip of the iceberg. She has made incredibly racist remarks about clients and walk-ins to our office, made me bend over in front of a mirror when she thought my shirt cut too low, blamed client complaints against her on the current political environment, and so much more. 

I would really love some advice on how to get out of here. If anyone has dealt with a similar situation please let me know. I feel so trapped because if I complain, she’s the only other one I work closely with. I would be afraid to get retaliated against.

P.S. if anyone knows of any remote jobs in the PNW area that would be really great. I have a Bachelor’s degree in Psych with a specialization in Law.

jobs,ask for a raise,Is it just me or has “loyalty” become the most expensive career mistake?,"I stayed at my first job for 4.5 years. Trained new hires, took on extra tasks, led projects—never once asked for a raise. I thought loyalty would speak for itself.

Then I watched a new hire (same role, less experience) come in at 20% higher pay. That’s when it hit me—loyalty doesn’t get rewarded, it gets exploited.

I left six months later. Got a 35% salary bump, better benefits, and I actually get told “thank you” now.

jobs,ask for a raise,got fired over $5 ,"for context: i work at a small sushi restaurant. we have two ways to give tips, one being on the receipts and one tip jar on our sushi bar (which you’d think would be for the sushi chefs). BTW all of our kitchen/ sushi workers are immigrants. typically we give all the tips from the jar to my manager at the end of the night when she closes, and i had been under the impression for two years that she had given the sushi bar chefs (which is one guy who has consistently stayed and carried the restaurant) their righteous tips. that’s what she told me, until i started counting tips myself, also in more recent months i had been told by my coworkers about their actual pay, and how they do not receive their given tips. 

anyways, we had a $5 tip from someone the other day and were closed yesterday, so i had the super wonderful great idea that i should give my coworker his tips this time. not to mention it was the middle of our shift which wasn’t really smart. i had done this one other time with i think $2 months ago. 

i got a call from my manager this evening, and she prefaced the call saying “is there anything you need to tell me?” i didn’t hide the fact i had given the tip to my coworker after it seemed like that’s what she was alluding to, still “naively” under the impression that they get their due tips, even though i was told they don’t. i’d never heard her so confident in speaking the way she did to me, it was like ballsy taunting. she asked me what i thought should come of us, and i told her i didn’t think it was fit for me to think of a consequence since i was the perpetrator, to which she said “no what do you think should be the next step now?” i said maybe a deduction in pay or to take away the amount i had given to him. at this point i was still unable to really form any concrete sentences, i guess that was part of not realizing the depth of what i had done. she told me she would talk to me on my next shift with the coworker i had given the tips to, and i told her it would be more appropriate about how to go from there at that point instead of over the phone. 

then i got this text

my whole heart just sank. i’ve been working at this job for 2 years, my manager was like a sister to me and all my coworkers and i were so close as well. i’ve picked up for when half of the staff was in korea, my manager even told me she had entrusted me with her shifts while she took months long breaks for more personal time even though i’m the one with two jobs (one is more voluntary) and school. i had just been the main trainer for two new consecutive workers the past few months. this week they had me work when i strep and i had even scheduled extra shifts prior to this week for them. i had just gotten a raise as well which felt like a scapegoat for my manager giving me more days to work. i don’t know what to do. this felt like losing my second family. i know what i did was wrong and got caught in the spur of the moment as it had felt right. 

i can agree i didn’t act in the most conventional way over the phone, but i really just didn’t know what to say and couldn’t think. i just let the questions air out and thought of short witted responses. 

if anyone has experienced getting fired from a job they love, please tell me how you moved on. best to you all ",19854,https://i.redd.it/9r9oldbqquqd1.jpeg,1727225007.0,Agitated_Ad_5822,1fos0w8,advice_seeking

jobs,ask for a raise,"I have been a hiring manager for 7 years at multiple companies. I see a lot of people here talking about difficulty getting hired. Recently, I have interviewed the worst candidates ever about 50 a week. Tips to get interviews and nail them. Will answer any questions in comments","
I have been a hiring manager for 7 years, for jobs paying $14/hr all the way to 350k a year salary. 

Recently, I have been interviewing for a position that pays $27-$32 an hour.

These interviews have been the worst I have ever conducted. 

It makes me wonder what the recruiter is filtering out and if good candidates are getting phased out before I even get to meet them. I work very closely to make sure this doesn’t happen but lately with all the “personality test” some companies have and hoops. They are getting filtered out before it even makes it to the recruiter.


Here are my tips to get through that and tips for a good interview.

Tips to get your resume in front of someone.

1. Now with all the filtering systems, a referral from someone working at the company is best. It will get you to a recruiter and the recruiter can save your resume from going into the abyss.

2. Apply for job even if you are not qualified, it is easier to get higher paying jobs because less people apply and even then the ones that are qualified sometimes have terrible attitudes and as a hiring manager I don’t have anyone to pick from and have to wait. I am willing to take someone who doesn’t match all the criteria to a T but has a good attitude. 

These jobs are usually 120k+ 


3. Instead of explaining your job in the resume make bullet points of your tasks.

Example don’t say: “I stocked shelves and helped customers and tried to sell credit cards and ran cash register”

Instead say “ •Managed inventory • assisted customers •upsold product add ons”

4. Some jobs require a lot of different tasks and you may know how to do a lot of things. When applying tailor your resume and include the things that will make you a good fit for this job

Example, if you are a server and are trying to get into a sales type position, your resume should say “informed customers of available menu items that fit their request, upsold add ons and pushed daily specials”

It shouldn’t say “took orders and ran food to tables” 

Because that isn’t going to help you in the new role you are applying for so it’s better to leave it out because the computer systems that filter the resumes may dispose yours.

5. If you are able to get in contact with recruiters directly that’s even better. LinkedIn is a great option, you can also find most recruiters directly that’s emails and remember most recruiters want you to get the job because that’s how they get paid. A lot of them will even give you pointers on what the hiring manager wants if you just listen to them.

6. If you lie to the recruiter, remember your lie. Most recruiters I have worked with take notes and send it to the hiring manger with your profile. 

Very often they tell the recruiter one thing and when I ask they forget or slip up. Also recruiters and hiring managers speak a lot and these things do come up so make sure to remain consistent.

7. Make sure your resume is up to date even if you fill out the correct information on your application. Most of the time when I sit down with a candidate what a recruiter hands me is the resume not the application and I don’t see the most recent or relevant experience. I always ask if it is up to date but seeing effort was put into it and it is recent can make or break when I’m stuck between 2 candidates with similar backgrounds

8. If the application requires a personality test read the job description and take into account any attributes they list and make sure to pick the corresponding on the personality test that will get you through most systems. If not just think of the job and what ideal person would be.

Example if you’re not talkative and extroverted but you’re applying for a sales position the ideal person would be talkative and extroverted in order to talk people into a sale. Select that.

If it’s a management position, you know that a manager needs to be strong, outgoing and persuasive. Select those.

But most job postings specify what they are looking for.

9. Use the job description and company’s mission statement to tailor your resume to get through any filtering systems.

10. Please apply with an appropriate email something professional. 

Interviews- 

Anything you say or do around or to a recruiter or hiring manager will be taken into account even if it is not part of the interview.

Examples of reasons I have not hired people:

1. Not following the instructions sent in the interview email. Example: showing up to the wrong location when the address is written clearly in the email. 

It shows you do not follow directions well.


2. Showing up early before your interview time and demanding to interviewed earlier. I have had people show up for 2:00pm interviews at 11:00am and demand to be taken in at 11:00.

I will say this is usually the older crowd that does this and they think it displays they are eager for the job. Which is a red flag to begin with. 

It’s also a disrespect to my time and the time I set aside for you. 

3. Your interview starts as soon as you are near the location or anywhere you may run into someone who works at the company. Examples a cafe nearby or on premises.

Being rude to staff: door man, receptionist, security etc. 

I’ve had candidates come in and yell at the receptionist because they are late, I’ve seen candidates at cafes nearby prior to the interview being rowdy/rude/combative with someone taking their order. 

The last thing I want is to responsible for hiring someone combative or having to deal with them myself. 

Vaping in the lobby, while waiting 5 minutes until your interview. If you cannot control yourself enough not to vape prior to even having the job that means you will vape on the job. 

Cigarettes, same thing. I try to stay away from hiring smokers because they need to stop what they’re doing to go smoke all the time and it is not productive and unfair to others who do not smoke and don’t go outside every hour. 

Refrain from smoking at the interview.


4. Please don’t smell bad or have very strong perfume on and please don’t smell like weed or cigarettes or anything of the sort.


Now mistakes I see during interviews- 

1. Assuming who you interview with will not be who you report to if you get hired. I look young for my age so very often people think there is an interview after me and don’t ask all the questions they should or say something like “yeah I have more questions but I will ask the next person”.

Or being combative/rude/condescending

2. Assuming since you have done this type of job for another company it is the same and being very cocky saying things like “yeah seems easy” “I already know this, dont have anyone questions”

Interviewers like people who ask questions, it lets us know that you are taking it seriously.

Assuming you have the job in the bag because you have had a similar position prior. This is a new place with new people, they don’t know you and you need to put forth the effort to show why they should go with you. 

3. Complaining about the job before even being hired. Example: When you are told expectations saying they are unrealistic. 

I get this a lot depending the position I am conducting interviews for but those expectations are there to let you know from the beginning what is expected. 


Or complain about the schedule that the recruiter already went over prior to scheduling the interview.

4. Being desperate/begging for the position. Saying things like “please I really need a job”

As a hiring manager, interviewing takes up a lot of time and so does training. I want to hire someone who sticks.

Any time I have ever hired someone desperate they quit because they are not considering what the job actually is and instead are just focusing on “I need a job” then realize it’s not for them or they’re in over their head or it feels too entry level for them.

5. Asking questions too in depth for the position. Example: if you are interviewing for a cashier position, don’t start asking what the margin on products are and how the company is planning to navigate tariffs and inflation.

These are great questions but raise a red flag when you are interviewing for an entry level position or a position that has nothing to do with that.

6. Bad mouthing other employers. Big red flag especially if it’s more than one employer you are bad mouthing, because most likely the problem is you. 

7. Assuming your age will speak for “experience”. 

If your resume says 30 years experience but I interview you and you’re stuck in business practices of 30 years ago and say things like “this is what we did before you were born”.

Experience doesn’t make you good. Just because you did something for 30 years doesn’t mean you’re good at it.

8. Not understanding the job. I sometimes have candidates that do not understand the position even after I explain it and this is the main reason, I pass on people.

Ask questions, get clarification, be engaged. 

9. Do not mention any personal struggles. Example: I’m a single mom, my husband died, my mom is sick etc.

None of these help me identify if you would be a good fit for the job and feel like you are trying to guilt trip me


Things you should do at interview-

1. Interviewers are human, I am very serious but if you make me laugh or feel like you aren’t my 39th interview of the day and it’s monotonous. I am more receptive and willing to hire. Personality sells in any position no matter what it is.

2. Ask questions, an interview works 2 ways get to know the company from your interviewer.

3. If you have any experience related to the job not listed on your resume make sure to bring it up even if it’s just volunteer work or a hobby


4. Ask your interviewer what would make someone a great fit for the position and tailor your answers to that.

5. Ask your interviewer what they are looking for in someone to take this position.

This is your opportunity to double down and sell your self on the traits they list

6. Get a feel for your interviewer or team, if it is a retail type setting observe the type of people working there and let interviewer know you will be a great fit for the team.

Last thing we want is to bring conflict into our team.

7. Study your interviewer.

If you are given the name of your interviewer prior to the interview look them up online. A lot of them use LinkedIn and post quotes or post what they like to see in the work place.

Use that to your advantage. Mention the quote or author or recite a work style they like. 


8. When you are leaving say nice meeting with you today (insert name). 

If you call someone by name they are more likely to remember you.


Those are the best tips I got. Any questions or advice I will answer comments.

I hope at least 1 person benefits from this 


Edit: if anyone lands a job after using this I would love to know, comment or pm. Thanks wish you all luck


Edit: Another tip, if you’re having trouble getting past the systems that filter out resumes, apply at smaller locally owned companies they typically do not have those and you’re much more likely to get actual eyes on your resume. 

Edit: another tip best day to apply is Tuesday 

Also a lot of people has been saying they can’t get picked for interviews and bad candidates get through.

jobs,ask for a raise,Am i being fucked over?,"I’m 17 and never worked a day in my life. Until i decided to work at a vacuum glass warehouse. It was really tough, i’m working 10 hours a day with no headphones and the only time i can sit down is lunch. Apparently glasses has a weight of a small car i guess. My back and legs are killing me. I learned earning money is not easy, i was sweating all day while cutting myself every opportunity i get. I permanently lost my privilege to say “I’m tired” without working. It’s nothing compared to those working blue collar jobs but still, it’s my first job ever.

Enough of that, i’m working 10 hours a day, and i’m getting paid around ~14$ a day. I just graduated and i need to earn money this summer to help my parents with my uni fee. Even if i was just cleaning glasses all day (which i don’t) ~14$ an hour is a bit less, i heard working at a convenient store pays the same. Should i ask for a raise or just ditch it? Or am i just being a soft boy? 


Update : I forgot to tell where i’m from and just expected y’all to guess so sorry about that. I live in Ulaanbaatar Mongolia, people think it’s a poor country but it’s far from the truth (although it’s not a rich country either), so overwhelming amount of people said i’m getting fucked over. I decided quit, not because the pay or the work but because i have asthma, i haven’t had an attack for like a year so i thought it toned down but i guess not. I didn’t drop out or anything, as i mentioned previously i just graduated so i thought i’ll work for this summer and make some money. Apparently you can’t work when you literally can’t breathe, sucks to be me i guess. I’m so unfit for survival that only job i’ll ever be able to do is a desk job. So, fuck. I learned earning money is so hard that it motivated me to study hard in uni. Either i study or work in that shithole for the rest of my life.

I don’t want to quit without anyone lined up. The market seems rough but I could possibly get my foot in the door through a friend in insurance. I thought I could always gets out if needed. I am just desperate to breathe a little 

Edit: thank you all for the responses. Just to share more background — 

The reason why I work so much is because I feel like I’m falling behind. I no longer feel good at what I do. I was promoted last May and placed in a highly complex business. I raised my hand to HR that this was simply too much. They validated my concerns by moving me to a new area, which I started a month ago. They put a senior buyer in my previous area. There’s more pressure to prove to myself and the company bc they did me this favor. However— I’ve been burnt out for the last 10 months. Learning a brand new business and adapting to a tougher manager feels extra challenging. I don’t know if I want to do this in the long run. I don’t eat or sleep well, I haven’t exercised in months. I keep asking myself what’s the point of money if I slave my life away.

jobs,negotiate salary,Wow interviews suck more now,"Just had my first interview in 7 years. I am still employed but looking for a better pay.
I was surprised the approach they had was defensive, instead of a conversation it was an interrogation 
I felt i managed well but it was horrible. At some point the lady got visibly offended i tried to negotiate a salary. She told me “if you go buy a coke do you expect to negotiate? This makes you look bad” and I replied “if you say so. To me this looks like normal open communication “. At that point the third person present ended the interview as it was obvious it wasn’t going to work out

EDIT: just some details. The recruiter mentioned the salary and asked me if i agreed before i was interviewed. I said yes. During the interview with HR (no recruiter present), i was asked what is my salary expectation. I repeated the same number recruiter told me. HR said they had a lower budget. I said i would be open to negotiating to accommodate their budget . I don’t know if negotiating was the wrong word but she didn’t like it. That’s when she made comments about how bad that looks. She asked why i felt i deserved such a high salary. I simply answered I was just adapting to what was on offer. 

They actually want to move forward with me, which tells me they simply wanted to intimidate me for a lower salary 

EDIT 2: i asked the recruiter about the salary discrepancy. She said it was her mistake to mention the salary for someone with experience with the exact same technology . I told her i have 8 years of transferable experience. I reminded her they were looking for recent grad when she mentioned the larger salary (i am much older than that) so how come they want such specific experience from a recent grad. She said they wanted to hire me. (How odd). I declined to move forward with them. I was clearly strong-armed into accepting a below average salary and they wanted to seal the deal quickly to get cheap labor",2390,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1jqj6gy/wow_interviews_suck_more_now/,1743688777.0,Immediate-Peanut-346,1jqj6gy,advice_seeking

jobs,negotiate salary,Salary negotiation advice,"Just wrapped up my second interview, this time with the hiring manager, and the conversation finally touched on salary. While the number they mentioned is certainly doable, it's not quite hitting my ideal target – it's about $5-10k shy.

A bit more context: This role would mean relocating, and they were pretty clear they don't offer relocation assistance, and the salary itself seemed presented as quite firm. However, this move would bring me back to an area I love, much closer to my family and, most importantly, my grandson. That's a huge personal win.

So here's my dilemma, and it's a big one: If (and that's a significant 'if' in this market) I get a formal offer, is it really smart to push for that extra $5k? I'm incredibly excited about both the company and the role itself; they've been wonderful, and I'd honestly probably accept the offer as is.

I found out I was getting fired because my employer put my job up for listing a couple days ago. They have also been pushing for me to have certain task done by Friday, and these task never had a due date on them before. 

As for why, I have no idea. I've made small errors and mistakes in my work but nothing that has ever been dramatically bad. I've gone above and beyond what my work requires of me and have always found something to keep me busy when I have nothing to do. (Which happens a lot) My boyfriend thinks it's because I don't agree with their views on life. (Though I've never been open with them, I've also never participated in what they do)

Anyways, how do I take control of the situation tomorrow? What are the do's and don'ts of handling this? I would like to be incharge of the conversation and not let this whole thing break me. Thanks in advance. 

*UPDATE*

A lot of people were wondering what happened to me. The good news is I didn't get fired today! The big boss never came in (we never see him Fridays anyways) and my manager left 2 hours early.

The bad news is that they put out a notice for everyone to do their annual self reflection review but skipped telling me. My manager also once again stressed how important it is that I have my notes on how to do my job finished being inputted into the computer. That plus everything else they have said and done this week, still makes me believe I'm being fired. This week, they had the owners wife sit at my desk and learn how to do my job ""just in case you're ever in this hospital"" (it's a family run business)

Even though I'm safe today, I'm still going to keep looking for a new job. I'm grateful for everyone's advice, and I feel like I'll be 100% prepared when the time finally comes. Hopefully, I'll have something lined up. 

Some people think I might be getting a promotion, but unfortunately there is no job I could be promoted to. It's a very small business and they only need one person for each job.

jobs,promotion advice,Promotion or Pay Rise? Torn Between a New Role and Fair Compensation—Need Advice!,"Hi everyone,

I'm in a bit of a dilemma and could really use some outside perspective.

I work in a large law firm in a senior admin role. I've been with the firm for 4 years—started at entry level and was promoted to senior 1.5 years in, after a formal interview process. Since then, I’ve consistently exceeded expectations, often stepping up as a de facto deputy to our team lead.

The team lead, while experienced, struggles with people management and team morale. I’ve naturally become the go-to person for support, and I’m very people-oriented, which the team appreciates.

Now here’s where it gets tricky: a brand-new “Assistant Team Lead” position has just been created. On paper, this is the logical next step for me—and I’m confident I already do a lot of what the role would require. However, the timing raises red flags: the role has been announced just before our salary review period, and the application window is extremely short (I have to submit by tomorrow).

Management has confirmed:

If I get the new role, I will not receive the annual pay rise I’ve worked hard for this past year.

They will not disclose the salary band until after the position is offered and accepted.

This last point is what's really bothering me. Is this even okay from an HR/legal perspective? How can I make an informed decision about a promotion without knowing the compensation? It feels like I’m being asked to sign a contract blindfolded.

Here are my main concerns:

Is it normal—or even permissible—for a company to delay salary disclosure until after an offer is accepted?

Is it worth taking on additional responsibilities—especially under a struggling manager—without knowing the pay?

Am I better off staying put and pushing for a strong raise based on my performance (which has already been positively reviewed)?

For context, I received an 8% raise and 3.5% bonus last year, and I believe I’ve earned the same or more this year.

Would love your thoughts—especially if you've been through something similar. Apply and risk being underpaid in a shiny new title? Or hold out for fair compensation where I am?

Thanks in advance!

jobs,promotion advice,I got promoted into a nightmare and I need advice or commiseration.,"I have worked at a large bank for 6 years. I have loved the whole experience up until I decided I wanted to pursue a career in the fraud department. 

I’m a fraud inventory control analyst, I basically assign out every fraud case to an investigator, and after they do their investigation I assign the cases over to a reviewer. This involves multiple insane excel workbooks and it’s generally a high stress job. I went into this knowing I had minimal experience with fraud or excel and I shocked myself with how quickly I’ve picked it all up and adjusted. 

HOWEVER. The girl that has been responsible for training me, and my boss, have been horrible to exist with from the go. They gave me a bad computer which really didn’t work for excel spreadsheets that contain a ton of data. So I’m learning how to do all of this very complex work on a broken computer, my boss didn’t believe it was broken. She started harassing me, basically,  like constant emails asking me what I was doing, blaming my computer issues on my home internet speed, making me send screenshots (like, not just one, multiple over the course of many weeks) of my internet speed. She was asking coworkers where I was if teams showed away for my two minute bathroom breaks. She made my coworker sit with me on multiple occasions to confirm 20x that my computer was not functional. We both were just like wow this is really weird, and he confirmed for her several times that this computer was broken. As a result, I was working 60-70 hour weeks, and I eventually called HR because the dynamic between my manager, my trainer and I was so awful I wanted to protect myself.

I have two toddlers and at one point my manager said “kids aren’t an excuse to not work 60 hour weeks. I used to drop my daughter off at daycare for 12 hours when I was getting started in this department.” Which was horrifying to me. She was also always asking me weird personal questions like “is the dad involved with your kids” and when I said yes she expressed visceral disappointment in my answer. Really weird. My trainer refused to answer questions by my third week in the job. I’ve worked at three large financial institutions and never had training for a complex role like this before. She would tell me she would add instructions to our job aids that were wrong just to be petty, for example. And all of this was with a broken computer. 

When I finally, two months later, got a call from the HR advisor- my manager had twisted all of the stories and evidence I gave that this was a very strange, hostile and toxic environment into defending herself. She said she was offering me extra daycare through work, instead of what she actually said. She ordered me a new computer that week, so the HR rep was like “well it sounds like they’re trying to help you by getting you a new computer” even though it had already been four months using one that barely worked, and I was tirelessly defending that this computer didn’t work. And ultimately nothing came of that HR call aside from being gaslit. Despite all of this, I did get a good performance review. 

A few weeks later i got an interview for a team I really wanted to move to, I told my manager. Made it to the second interview, and then got put on a PIP. And they have made this whole month absolute hell. I’m doing everything I’m supposed, I’ve provided verifiable, documented evidence of meeting and exceeding their expectations and they’re still making it seem like I’m going to get fired, my trainer will find arbitrary “errors” that make no sense or don’t exist. 

I know this was retaliation but I can’t really prove it. I’ve recorded conversations just to have proof that I’m not crazy. I’ve loved this company, I’ve been written up or had a bad performance review. And now I’m going to be forced out, despite learning how to do this job with very broken technology, and this horrible environment.

She also said I didn't have the amount of experience she wanted for the role (I have 3 years of grant admin experience) which again was like...what?

I was pretty skeptical of the company at first…but they basically told me in the interview “get in at the ground floor”.

And I’ll be damned…it’s really fucking growing. They’ve recently made a bunch of new positions to accommodate this growth. 

I was hired at the entry level position along with 4 other guys. We directly reported to an Ops manager that worked alongside us. We all started on the same day.

This entire Canadian division hasn’t even been around for 3 months…I’m still technically on probation. 

My boss(ops manager) got a promotion to a new position and will be relocating…and they offered me his former position.

I’ve never been a manager…anywhere…ever. I know that I’m capable, and will be a good leader…but holy fuck…I have a bit of whiplash and don’t want to mess this up.

I had to quit my last job because the company would make me work on the weekends and during sick leaves as well. It got to a point where I was extremely sick and overwhelmed. 

Ever since that I’ve been looking for a job (as a Content Writer) and after countless applications, I finally landed one (or it seemed like it). 

After 4-5 rounds of interviews I finally got shortlisted at a company. After salary negotiations, the HR kept reassuring me that I’ll be receiving my offer letter shortly. The HR kept giving the reason that the offer letter is ready and just the CEO’ s approval and signature is pending, and that I’ll be onboarded this week itself. After asking for continuous updates for more than 3 days, the HR now informs that they are actually looking for a Content Marketer and my job offer has been kept on hold indefinitely. I was really upset and the HR kept saying that it’s the upper- management’s decision and that there is nothing she can do about it.

I am beyond angry and frustrated at this point. And this is after all the documentation and background verification checks. I am fucking devastated.

It’s rubbing me the wrong way because during the “we would like you to join our team” call they said they couldn’t do more than 19/hr and I’ll be working in a different department as the one I originally thought.

jobs,job offer negotiation,UPDATE: Hallelujah I got a job offer! How do I ask for more money when I accept?,"I posted here this weekend asking for some advice about a job offer I received Friday night.

I explained that I've been unemployed for 2 years after a layoff, except for some freelance work. Despite dozens of interviews over the last few years, this is the first job offer I've received with an excellent company, and I'm absolutely over the moon. However, the offer was $2K under the bottom of the range I told them I was targeting, and I wanted some insight on how to make it clear I'm thrilled about the opportunity but want to discuss any potential for higher pay, to at *least* meet the bottom of my range.

The comments I received here were SHOCKING. The overwhelming sentiment, from 100+ comments was ""take what you're offered, shut up, and be grateful, you idiot"". It was suggested over and over that my offer would be rescinded, I was being absolutely ridiculous, greedy, and stupid, that my offer would be revoked just for asking for the weekend to consider it, etc. One person looked at my previous posts and found out I have a chronic disease, and suggested I'm particularly idiotic for even considering negotiating my salary because of my illness. Another person said it's clearly my own fault I haven't found a job in 2 years, because I ""don't want one"" and that when this offer gets taken off the table I will continue to ""play the victim"" ??


Admittedly I couldn't get through all of the toxic and negative comments, so I deleted the post. It made me sick to my stomach. There was one very kind person who DMed me after, and gave me some really solid advice and encouragement. Their messages made me feel a lot better, but overall I was so shaken by the responses I got that I was not going to attempt to negotiate and just accept the original offer first thing Monday morning.

But at the last minute I got a fresh wave of courage, I did some research, I discussed it with the people closest to me.. and I crafted a well planned, polite, enthusiastic message asking for a 5% increase.

I was so, so fucking nervous, but I didn't have to wait long because they responded within the hour with a counter offer of 3% and I accepted. They actually sounded a little surprised when I accepted their first counter-offer too, so I think I could have kept negotiating, but I had reached the limit of my courage at that point 😅

So: a happy ending. 

The lesson here is don't believe all the toxic, negative, scarcity-mindset bullshit that gets spewed in the internet. Being out of work for a long time doesn't decrease you value in the job market. Just because you're desperate it doesn't mean you can't ask for what you think you deserve. 

And if you've been job searching for what feels like forever, don't give up. There were SO many times over the last 2 years that I was convinced this was the end of my career, and I should just throw in the towel. But I really had no choice but to keep trying and I'm actually so genuinely excited about this job and proud of myself for sticking it out and asking for what I want. And you can do it too.

TL;DR: I ignored the advice I got on Reddit and secured a 3% increase on my first job offer in 2 years.",68,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1g8yo19/update_hallelujah_i_got_a_job_offer_how_do_i_ask/,1729539544.0,Global_Echo8,1g8yo19,advice_seeking

Everyone, including my immediate supervisor, has been supportive from day 1. I’ve been at the job for nearly 3 years and have learned a lot. My boss and I regularly discuss me learning what I need to, and taking on tasks, that will help get me promoted. 

But like every job, there are aspects that are stressful. And I have been stressed lately due to the workload as well as client demands. I’m beginning to have thoughts that maybe I’m not cut out for the next job. Or at least, that maybe I don’t want the extra responsibilities, even if I am capable
of handling them.

jobs,how to get promoted,How to ensure I get promoted? Leadership said I was performing in that role but isn’t taking action,"I am at an industry job in a corporate strategy function for a large company. My role is Senior Associate and I want the Manager promotion. I got promoted last year but am still catching up to my level had I not lateraled to a new function (analytics to strategy). I am doing really well at my job since it’s a blend of both. We have two managers. I am blowing the managers out of water with them reporting directly to me for some projects and I often add more value than a lost senior manager on my team as well. I feel like I deserve the manager promotion. Both my supervisor (Director) and skip-level (Chief Strategy Officer) agreed that I was performing at the Manager level but have recently had conflicting points and a changing tone. 

The Director holds me to a much higher standard than the Managers and even admitted to it. He said it’s bad for optics for the rest of the team to promote me so quickly (in just one year). I can see him trying to find faults to justify not promoting me. He keeps pushing that I need higher tenure at the company for a promotion.

The Chief Strategy Officer is dealing with this in a more sophisticated way. He keeps pushing out the conversation saying he needs to see how the business is doing and what his budget is. He has also admitted that I’m performing at that level already and well.

The other tricky component is that I applied to MBA programs and if I get accepted, I will be leaving this job in August and they know this (they wrote my letters of recommendation). 

My question is - how do I get them to promote me? What is an effective way of going about this? Should I be aggressive and share the projects I am leading when other Managers aren’t even doing that?

jobs,how to get promoted,How to Get a Promotion in your office?,"This post is actually more about how not to get a promotion in the office! 😄

If you want a promotion (and all the perks that come with it), you need to master the following “skills”:

- Build a strong connection with your boss. Even if your projects don’t perform well, your boss will have your back.

- Learn how to be visible. Focus on showing more and doing less work.

- Forget about good food—your tongue shouldn’t have a sense of taste! If you get it, you get it. 🤣

-Don’t have your own point of view. Always say “Yes” to everything your boss says. For example, if they call you “C,” agree with it (and by “C,” I mean clever, not what you’re thinking! 😁).

-Never outsmart your boss. Always pretend to be less competent so they don’t feel threatened or fear being replaced.

-Resign strategically! It’s a powerful tool—but use it wisely. 😜

- Don’t teach your colleagues anything. If they learn from you, you might lose your edge.

———————————————

Now, the real question: How not to get promoted?

-Focus on learning while delivering your tasks.

- Work hard, but also figure out how to complete tasks faster than others. Use the saved time to improve yourself.

- Don’t compromise long-term career growth for short-term achievements.

- Do a personal SWOT analysis. Don’t let your boss’s perception define your strengths and weaknesses.

- Prioritize your customer’s growth. When you focus on delivering value, you gain confidence. Even if things don’t work out, you’ll learn valuable lessons.

- Have your own point of view, but also listen to others. Work on the best idea your team has, rather than sticking to your own idea only.

- Stay out of your comfort zone. This fear will drive you to continuously work on your skills.

- Teach others everything you know. Sharing knowledge will push you to keep learning new things.

- Network with a giving mindset rather than a taking mindset.

Golden Rule: If you want to go fast, follow the first section. If you want to go far, follow the second one.

jobs,how to get promoted,Here's How To Write A Killer Resume That's Gotten Me Dozens of Job Interviews and Job Offers,"I've been reading a lot of resumes recently on Reddit and I myself struggled with writing resumes a few years ago (job interviews as well), but I wanted to write down a lot of what I've learned to put you way ahead of the game. 

One thing to keep in mind is that everyone will of course have different advice on this topic and you might find ideas that clash. In that scenario, you just need to weigh up both pieces of advice and see what you think is right for your case scenario.

  
**File Format**

The first thing I wanted to discuss is the debate between submitting a resume as a PDF file vs a docx file. I've personally used a docx file for the most part and have gotten plenty of job offers. I've also used PDF files and gotten job offers, a lot of other people have either had one or the other experience.

The one thing with docx files is that your hiring manager might not have Microsoft Word on their computer so if they can't open it, it's going to put you at an obvious disadvantage. Whereas with PDF, it can open on both Chrome or Adobe. They probably have both.

  
**The Right Resume Template**

This is one that so many people get wrong. They think that they need to have a really good looking resume template.

This is COMPLETELY WRONG. When you have colour boxes, icons, profile pictures, multiple horizontal sections, and you upload your resume to a job post, it goes through the ATS system (which is basically a filter that scans your resume before the employer sees it), and when you have all that extra stuff on there, it's unable to read your resume, which means your employer doesn't see it, which obviously means you won't get a job interview.

I didn't want to go too in-depth on ATS here as it's been talked about a lot but it's one of the most important things that you need to know to land a job interview. Probably the most important. Make sure you do some research on this before you build your resume.

A simple black and white resume that has 1 column, going vertically is all you need. Here is an example below of a good vs bad resume that I got from Google.

[https:\/\/resumeworded.com\/bad-resume-examples-key-advice](https://preview.redd.it/n6fb1md7j0jd1.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=cafb1a9a0feedbeda1adbf31f2f90cbc5945d919)



**A Professional Summary**

Some people say you don't need one, but I completely disagree. This is your chance to give a sales pitch and tell them in a summary why you're the most qualified person for the role. This is also your chance to capture their attention and get them to read the rest of your resume.

You don't want anything generic on here. Here is an example from my marketing resume that has gotten me a lot of job interviews and job offers. I'll explain why it's effective:

""I’m a paid ads specialist with 5 years of experience, having worked with 75+ service-based and eCommerce-based businesses including extensive experience in the fashion and retail niche.

I have a proven track record of delivering profitable results for my clients, having generated well in excess of $50,000,000 in revenue and having worked over 30 different industries. 

Additionally, I’ve managed well over $1,500,000+ in ad spend per month across all my clients, with my highest client spending $850,000 per month.""

  
The reason the above is effective is because:

- The job title is for a ""paid ads specialist""

- They require at least 3+ years of experience and I have more than that

- They wanted someone who specialises in working with eCommerce businesses which I did and I included the ""fashion and retail"" niche because they wanted someone who is experienced with those industries

- I wrote how much revenue I generated to make myself standout 

- I included 30 different industries to show my diverse experience

- The job description wanted someone who can manage budgets of $30k per month, I've done well above that

  
Remember the golden rule. Make sure your professional summary revolves what they are looking for.

  
**The Bullet Points On Your Resume**

This is the other section that people get wrong on the resume. They write down tasks that they did at work instead of talking about outcomes they achieved or including some kind of numbers.

For example, people might write ""Provided professional customer service"" instead of ""Provided world-class customer service to 150+ customers, weekly"", this looks much better

Your bullet points should look something like (if possible)

\* Generated $X in revenue with X amount of time with via X channel / strategy

\* Managed budgets over $X amount

\* Reduced wait time from X minutes to X minutes by streamlining processes

\* Delivered customers' orders in under X minutes on average

\* Reduced manual data input by X+ hours per day by implementing X

  
Remember this rule. 

Every bullet point that is part of the job requirements on the job ad, make a bullet point on your resume that addresses the job requirement bullet point and make sure your bullet point talks about a relevant outcome that you achieved or attach some kind of number to it.

For example, if the job requirement is ""someone who can lead a team of at least 5 people"", you would write something like, ""managed a team of 25+ team members, having delivered 100+ successful projects..."". 

That's just an example above. Replace the numbers with what's accurate to your last role. This makes you stand out a lot more as opposed to putting generic tasks that you performed at your role. The bullet point above lists numbers and addresses what they are looking for.

You could even put something like ""Managed a team of 25+ team members & improved workplace efficiency by 35%""

  
**Put Your Job Title Under Your Name**

On your resume where your name is, it's a good idea to put a job title that is ideally the exact same as the one on the job description or whatever is very close to it. This makes you look immediately qualified for the role.

For example, if the job description says ""Customer Service Officer"", you put that exact title under your name if you worked in customer service, and if it's applicable to your work experience.



**Put Education On The Bottom Of Your Resume**

This has also been talked about quite a bit. People say to put your education first if you're a recent graduate which is fine but for most cases when you have a lot of relevant experience, you always want to put the experience section first. Here is how your resume should look like top to bottom:

  
**Top:**

- Personal details 

- Professional summary

- Experience

- Projects (if you have any projects you worked on that are relevant to the role)

- Testimonials & case studies (this is not talked about much but it can really make you stand out if you provide a link to Canva for example which shows your achievements, I used this for marketing a lot)

- Education

**Bottom:**



**Don't Include Unnecessary Things**

People have the habit of stuffing their resume with things that don't matter. The thing is that your hiring manager wants to find the best fit for the role. Nothing more, nothing less. 

This means many different things such as skills, personality, culture fit, mindset, etc. But there are things below which you don't need to include and here is why:

  
**- Skills** (you don't need a section on this because you should convey all of this on your bullet points and your professional summary. When you say something like your skills are: Programming, Excel, Word, Facebook ads, TikTok ads. This doesn't mean anything and it doesn't hold any weight. 

  
**- Interests / hobbies** (absolutely not needed. Your employer doesn't care that you like to go fishing on the weekend. You can talk about this stuff when you get the job. I've had employers ask me in job interviews what my hobbies are, you might have it happen to you as well. That's a better time to talk about it. Save your hobbies for the interview if they bring it up or once you get the job.

A quick note. In the job interview when they ask you the question ""tell me a little bit about yourself"", do NOT start talking about your hobbies. 

That question is your only chance to sell yourself and talk about why you're the best fit for the role. this will set the tone for the rest of the interview. 

The answer to this question is where you set an impression. Get this wrong, and the whole interview will go down the toilet)



**- Languages** (sometimes people write down that they can speak multiple languages. This is useful if the role requires it or will be useful for the role, but if it isn't, leave it off as it's taking up space on your resume and gives you no advantage)



**References on Request**

Never put this on your resume. If they need references, they will request it. This is just taking up valuable real estate and gives you no advantage whatsoever.

-------------------------------

Other small tips:

- When naming your resume file, name it as ""Firstname-Lastname-Resume""

- Ignore advice that says ""don't make your resume longer than 1 page"" this is false. You can't fit everything on 1 page if you have 1-2 jobs on there, especially when you need to add in a few bullet points when you're tailoring your resume. Not to mention, your professional summary.

- Don't spam the same resume to every job. I keep seeing posts how people applied for 200+ jobs with no interviews. They probably used the exact same resume for every job posting. This doesn't work, you HAVE TO tailor it if you want results.

- Don't be lazy and use ChatGPT. AI is super overrated and it produces garbage results. All you will end up is with a generic resume that looks the same like every other resume. AI can't tailor your resume effectively, we are a long way away from that. 

- Remove irrelevant jobs where possible. You might be worried about the employer asking you about a ""Gap"" on your resume. Just simply explain ""I had other jobs that I worked in-between but they weren't relevant to the role so I wanted to make sure that I only included the most relevant experience"". This response will work fine. 

Now if you have no relevant experience then leave it as something is better than nothing.

jobs,how to get promoted,Why is no one actually hiring?,"So i’ve been looking for a steady job since January. I’ve sent in about 40 applications this past month, and i’ve gotten literally 5 responses back. 3 to reject me and 2 to schedule an interview. Do people not even send out rejection messages anymore these days?? Like literally just no reply back and a lot of the time no indication that my application is even being looked at. Why do you have postings up if you’re not keeping up with your applicants?

I’m 21F, don’t have a degree but I graduated HS with honors, took college classes, and studied graphic design while in HS. I have a couple years of service management experience with references. I’d say I have pretty good resume compared to other people my age. I’ve never not gotten a job i’ve applied for up until this point, and i’ve never worked a job where I wasn’t getting promoted, or at least getting a raise within a couple months. 

I’ve applied to all sorts of jobs. Listings from second hand websites, listings directly on their respective websites, bottom of the barrel service jobs, management, assistant management, shift lead, nanny/babysitting, office, warehouse, remote, part time, full time. I always put open availability including overnight. 

The first interview I mentioned getting I didn’t end up attending, because I didn’t do enough research beforehand and it turned out to be an MLM scheme. The second was a full time caregiving job. Did an over the phone interview which lasted over an hour, then an in person to meet the family. We discussed pay, responsibilities, all the intricacies, I was under the impression I had gotten the position. They had told me to contact them to discuss a start date and when I sent a follow up message they had just completely ghosted me. I would understand if they found someone that was a better fit, but they could’ve communicated that with me.

❗️This is the end of my relevant information, I just start yapping from here on out❗️

The whole reason for my unemployment is such a long story I might make another post in more detail. Basically I got laid off in December  from a warehouse job I had been at for over a year. I was doing really well there and it was such an easy job for the pay. Long story short I got sexually assaulted and harassed along with my friend group by this individual for weeks after. We reported this to HR a total of at least 10+ times all together. When they continued to do nothing I had enough of her BS and they fired me for tapping her on the shoulder to get her attention and asking her “wtf is your problem.” The actual written down reason for my termination was because I tapped her on the shoulder. I then started a very long process with EEOC where I got a small ass settlement that didn’t even cover my backpay, and a large percentage of it went to my attorney. I settled in the interest of not dealing with it for another 9 months, plus courts typically rule in favor of the employer, at least in my county. 

The jobs i’ve had since then were home depot, which I quit on my 5th day. They scheduled me for extremely inconsistent hours and told me I wouldn’t be allowed to request a schedule change, have any time off, or have any of the benefits they were advertising to my onboarding group, including insurance, for at least A YEAR. And most recently I went back to the service industry and bartended for a pizza spot. My GM, who clearly had a lot of issues, deleted a bunch of my open checks right in front of my face, then proceeded to fire me for it. This was over a month ago and I only worked there for 2 months, made good tips in the time I did work there though.

My bf 22M also got laid off in relation to the miscarriage of the sexual assault case, and has been having the same struggles with getting a job. He refuses to seek out his own settlement because he saw how mentally taxing it was for me. We have basically been living off my shitty settlement, but it’s going to run out within a few months and I’m starting to seriously get worried. I’ve never had issues with landing a job before. I get we’re somewhat in a recession but this seems so extreme. If anyone knows places that are ACTUALLY fucking hiring please help a girl out. I’m thinking of just going into strips of places and handing my resume out like candy.

The company is great and management is great but the immediate manager sucks. He knows nothing about our domain, often undermines people and takes criticism really bad. He asserts his Dominance and makes sure I’m invisible to the leadership. However one leader did set up a one - one with me though. 

Anyway, the opportunity is great and the culture is great but this guy is trying to create a bad culture and he even tells me that being busy is good. He doesn’t let me work to my full potential and blocks my way each day with anything I do. He’s probably also micromanaging me and checking my teams status all the time because he has no one else that speaks to him. The rest of the team hate him and he has really bad connections with those below is level. I’ve also received straight up feedback from some subordinates that he is a pain in the ass to work with and they plan on leaving with extremely sour feedback on him. 

He is known to take grudge and escalate unreasonably. He is also so much noise and no stuff.

I had a change of manager who's been false accusing me for poor performance. HR on the other side is taking sides with the new manager and she's been super rude to me, even asking uncomfortable questions regarding my personal life. Both of them together put me on a PIP which I absolutely did not sign as most of the accusations seems framed and the deadlines were super unrealistic. I personally feel they have been belittling me and showing racism. But I tried so hard to comply just because I'm in need of money. However, working for almost 15 hours a day, trying to meet unreasonable deadlines and facing false, rude comments from the HR - I totally lost my mental peace. I finally gathered the courage and sent over my resignation to the Vice President, describing my situation. I also made sure to state that I'm stepping away only because of the biased behavior of the HR personnel but not due to any aspects of the PIP.

jobs,toxic workplace,The aftermath of leaving a toxic workplace,"Hi. I'm looking for unvarnished opinions here. I recently quit an extremely toxic job where I had an awful micromanager who always made me feel small and nitpicked everything I did. It got to a point where I just couldn't trust my judgement anymore and my confidence was completely eroded. So because I was trying to find a way out of that awful environment, I decided to pursue a second undergrad. Not necessarily because I had a passion for a certain field, but because that job had messed with my head so much that I thought I needed to blow up my career and start from scratch. I briefly considered doing a masters or applying for other jobs, but that job completely turned me off of the field I was in (writing) and I guess I just psyched myself out of applying to masters programs because my confidence was totally shot and assumed I wouldn't get in anyway.

So now, a few months into my second undergrad I'm starting to think I mistakenly made this decision as a reaction to a toxic environment. Now I didn't realize it at the time and I genuinely thought I wanted to do the second undergrad. But now that I'm actually in it, I'm thinking clearly now and I honestly don't know why I didn't consider my other options more thoroughly. And for context, before i started that job, I was considering a masters in a couple of years but that job caused me to panic about ending up in a similar role again so I decided to FULLY shift to a new career path. And I chose the second undergrad because it felt like the exact opposite of my experience and I kept saying that nothing could ever be worse than that job!

I just don't understand why I'm suddenly having doubts when I seriously felt like I wanted a second undergrad just 5 months ago (when I was still at that job). So my question is: have you ever found yourself making rash decisions because you were trying to escape a toxic work environment?

I had been working in a large company for 3 years without any major issues. I requested a transfer to another country within the same company, and ever since, I feel like it’s been the cause of my depression and anxiety.

My colleague constantly makes comments about everything and nothing — the time I arrive and leave. She always has a somewhat threatening tone (even if she's laughing). I asked to sit in the open space because I was originally forced to sit next to her every day, and she clearly told me I’d get in trouble if I did that.

Once, I left work 15 minutes early and she told me I was going ""freestyle"" and that I needed to follow the rules. If I arrive later than usual, I can clearly see her watching the time closely. She uses the excuse that she wants to help me because she’s my ""mentor,"" and she constantly gives me advice as if I had just started the job — even though I’ve been in the same role for 3 years. I feel like she treats me like I’m an idiot.

I reported this to the managers two months ago, and nothing has changed. I also tried talking to her, but she refuses to listen or understand what I’m saying. At best, she apologizes but then repeats the same behavior the next day.

jobs,systemic burnout,Is this what burnout is?,"Hey all. I'm not sure if advice or just a place to vent is what I'm looking for here but. I think I've hit the full blown feeling of burnout. 

I am a store manager at a 24/7 location. Recently lost employees due to LP + a hiring freeze due to new systems (company had a merger recently). I am able to hire - and have - but still need 1 more employee to round things out. 

The past 4 weeks have made me feel very, very, disconnected with reality. 

- I worked the overnights due to assistant unable to because of their life and its 100% understandable 
- my body hates overnights, it makes me not function properly, eat properly, and basically makes brain unable to be happy 
-i have depression that I can manage, but 3 weeks without a day off and consistent overnights + a few times having to work 15+ hour shifts by myself just make me so numb that idc about anything including health 
- can't just quit due to bills and over spending on fast food + ""what can I grab here"" due to where I live and no food places open past 11pm 
- reaching out for help in my district or to my district manager basically ends in ""sucks to suck"", basically have been told that if all my employees are sick or don't show I have to work until someone does show up (and I have which was 22 hours once)
-its not a sales location, but we sell product and my YoY sales on a weekly basis are the highest in my district + our managerial tasks that are tracked I have 100% in 
- I've had the worst thing happen to me in feb of this year with a death that I havent been able to properly comprehend or comes to terms with since 3 days after my location had a total makeover to the new company layout planograms etc and if I know if I do try to process it I'll break and not be able to work for days which isn't allowed 
- salary and they took our clock in/out ability sway despite having required hours and if not worked I don't get paid, they just don't want to pay us overtime 
- my location isn't the only one struggling in my district and we feel we are on islands while others are ""favored"" and get more assistance from our DM 
- my location wasn't 24 hours when I was hired in as management last year but they said a direct competitor close is so was forced upon me and I had it done and implemented a week before deadline 
- I had 1 day off in the past 4 weeks, except a couple times I slept for 15 hours uncontrolled and literally not functioning to the point I don't remember my alarms going off or my assistant calling telling me to get up, only to not get up forcing them to close my store which I could be fired for 


This is just some of it. I don't want to say if I am or am not having interviews at other places just in case, but man. 

I'm always the first manager when told to jump - my feet are already off the ground. I help other managers with things. My phone is on me 24/7 and I get woken up due to xyz issues at 2am 4am etc etc. If someone calls off or something happens - welp sucks to be me gotta do it, and I do. 

I have things documented about certain things so I have never felt like my job security is threatened. 

My state does not require a break between working xyz hours + no during work break requirements after xyz hours. 

We are given a tight labor hour budget per week and despite my locations successes and asking for how I get more labor hours, my store has the least while producing as much in sales as other locations that basically can hire 2 more full time employees over me.

I have things I can go to hr with regarding a few things but honestly, what's the point man. Just put a target on me and due to not functioning 100% of the time recently it would affect my job security. 

I'm sure others have been in the same boat, and just jumped ship. This job is fairly easy for what I'm being paid... When everything is going well. But lately it hasn't, and the people causing the issues are gone that were my employees - it's just counting down for when something happens again and I'm stuck doing long hours + no time to myself. I have set boundaries but in regards to being there when shit hits the fan, I am not allowed to and reaching out for assistance is always met with the sucks to suck, and God dam does it suck right now.

jobs,systemic burnout,Looking for perspective re: quota-based bonus vs. annual raises.,"tl;dr - Quota-based bonus is higher than theoretical salary increases (employer confirmed no more raises and an ""eat what you can kill"" bonus structure), but I have long-term reservations.  Am I just being an over-cynical ingrate, or am I right to have reservations?

I work as a paralegal for a small but relatively prosperous law firm.  I'm paid at the higher end of the spectrum but haven't received a salary increase in three years.  In early 2024, I was refused a request for the equivalent of two years of 3% raises based upon the assertion that I'm already highly paid (despite no standard benefits such as health insurance, below market vacation accrual, etc., so I might be higher on the wage scale but not necessarily total compensation package).  In addition, the paralegals are overworked, probably more than usual for the field, and team morale is low.

Instead of a raise, the attorney/owner implemented a quota-based system for all of the paralegals; once the points threshold is met, a bonus is accrued and paid quarterly for each case filed (not including cases filed before the threshold is met).  In truth, I ended up flying high since I crushed the quota before the end of the third quarter and my bonus was higher than a theoretical raise trajectory.  However, the attorney finally confirmed this year that he would not be giving base salary increases and that we would be on an ""eat what you can kill"" policy.

On one hand, I should be grateful for the large bonus, but I have long-term reservations.  For the short-term it might be good, but there is no guarantee that the bonus policy will remain indefinitely.  Also, with inflation, it will mean that I will have to increasingly do more just to break even.  Even now, I was only able to hit a high bonus by focusing on filing cases at the expense of other administrative tasks (like maintaining my email inbox to a sane level).  It just seems like it will be a treadmill of diminishing returns and increased burnout, not to mention that if the policy is removed then I'm left with potentially several years of no raises.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1i1degk/looking_for_perspective_re_quotabased_bonus_vs/,1736880880.0,Philhelm,1i1degk,advice_seeking
jobs,systemic burnout,"Feeling Unfulfilled Despite a Decent Career, Seeking Advice on Finding Purpose","Hey Reddit,

I’m a 30-year-old woman working in healthcare IT, currently in a role that blends server administration, network engineering, and clinical engineering. I’ve been in my current role for about 3 years and generally enjoy the work I do. Before this, I worked in a couple of other healthcare IT roles, including one in system administration (specializing in operating room and anesthesia equipment) for about 3 years before accepting a promotion in information security. 

While I enjoyed parts of each role, I’ve come to realize that my biggest priorities in a career are: 1) Finding a place where growth is encouraged, 2) having a sense of purpose and helping others, and 3) having some autonomy in how I approach my work

I've also realized things I *don't* like, and a lot of it was blaring in the infosec role - micromanagement, lack of trust between management and employees, and general ""just sit there and watch for usual activity over endpoint security tool"" roles. 

My current job meets these priorities fairly well, and I do think I’m good at it, both from technical and people/patient safety perspectives. I also know I’m relatively young compared to others in similar roles, so I’m always trying to learn and improve while staying true to my own way of working.

Over the past year, I’ve had the chance to work in environments that are different from my norm - specifically military medical centers and other government facilities. Which has pushed me to take on more responsibility, travel, and ultimately transfer to a different territory/team. I’ve recently moved 2-3 hours away from my hometown to better limit the amount of travel I was expected to do in 2024. 

However, despite liking my job, I’ve started feeling like something’s missing. I love the work I do, and I enjoy being a mentor for other women in tech, but I can’t shake the feeling of being “on autopilot.” I’ve been taking a lot of PTO recently to avoid burnout, and I’ve tried to focus more on hobbies and self-care (cooking, working out, etc.), but I still feel this sense of unfulfillment. I see people online or on TV doing things they truly love, and I just can’t figure out how to get there myself.

I’m in a relatively secure position, making a good salary, and working in a niche industry with decent job stability. But still, I feel a lack of purpose. My spouse and I have built our life around my job, and while I don’t want to throw that away, I’m struggling to figure out how to find that passion for *anything* or deeper sense of fulfillment.

Has anyone else felt this way in their career? Or just generally in life? Any advice on how to break out of this funk would be greatly appreciated.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1i7hsif/feeling_unfulfilled_despite_a_decent_career/,1737569871.0,nuocmami_k,1i7hsif,advice_seeking

jobs,constantly overworked,"Boss went on last-minute announced vacation, I was going to send in my two week notice… what now?","update: I sent it in! My boss is giving me hell but it’s okay I’m standing my ground lol.

TL;DR i was about to put in my two weeks, boss left on 3 week vacation and over scheduled me on a week i get a really important medical procedure done. i called off in advance but she claims she just forgot, and is pressuring me to come into work that day anyways.

—————————

I’ve been at my part-time job for about a year, and I’m really grateful for the experiences gained from it. However we’re understaffed, overworked, and my coworkers and I are just flat out disrespected by management constantly.

It’s a small business of about 20 people, and we just had a work meeting where someone was congratulated for coming into work when they weren’t scheduled… multiple times. While I think it’s admirable my coworker did that because we don’t have enough people, I think it’s absolutely insane that we’re encouraging this kind of behavior instead of hiring more people. We have the payroll to do it, this business makes well over enough, skims out on a lot of repairs and maintenance to save even more money, and we all get paid close to minimum wage. 

A lot of my time-off requests or availability changes keep getting rejected for no reason, despite sending it weeks and/or months in advance. My coworker got a week long time-off request for a vacation 7 months from now rejected because my boss doesn’t want to hire more people, and this girl already had a flight booked. 

I had sent in a time-off request for one day in two weeks, because I’m undergoing a medical procedure and going under anesthesia, and my doctor had specified that I cannot go into work. I have a doctors note, I sent in the request weeks in advance, and my boss just told me that she forgot. She also proceeded to pressure me into possibly working that day, before I go through with the procedure, and I just feel outright disgusted that she keeps pushing that on me despite me saying no multiple times. 

There’s a lot more about this job I could go into that are probably health and work violations— we have an ongoing severe rat problem that’s been here for years— but I would be here writing for half an hour. When I got hired, there were rats in our water cooler machine! Which was really sick to find out right after drinking from it 🥲

My boss seems to decide she can take vacations and not notify us until a few days before, she just decided to take a 3 week vacation out of nowhere to spend time with her kids out of town. Right before this was announced, I was already at my tipping point and ready to quit— but I wanted to do it professionally so I don’t burn any bridges. Now I can’t do that for potentially 3 weeks. She doesn’t check her email unless she’s physically at work. The worst part of it all is when I got hired I specifically mentioned that I cannot work more than 2-3 days a week because I’m a college student, and I take summer classes. She scheduled me for 4 days on the same week I undergo that medical procedure. She doesn’t even have the power to change the schedule now because she’s gone too.

1. Job hunting is brutal - people without jobs are miserable. They are struggling with bills and constant rejections. There’s no shortage of people who want to work, but either the opportunities aren’t there, or the requirements are absurd.

2. The ones with jobs are also fucking miserable. They’re overworked and burnt out. The whole “do more with less” culture is just sucking the life out of people. Work-life balance? Nah.

3. Corporations are reporting record profits. And while they’ve got plenty of money to invest in hiring more staff, they’re keeping it all at the to or god knows where else.


When you put these three together, the solution seems obvious - hire more people and move to a 4-day work week. 

A shorter week would give existing employees a well needed (and deserved) break, and hiring more people to cover those gaps would help with the shortage of jobs and give the unemployed a chance to earn a fucking living.

As for corporations? They might actually benefit too. Happier, less burned-out employees are more productive, more loyal, and more likely to do a great job.

Yes, there would be upfront costs in hiring and training more staff, but the long-term payoff would outweigh it.

This model already works for some companies. Hire more people, cut the work week to four days, and actually improve things for employees AND the company.

Then why are we so slow with moving to what seems like an abvious solution? Or am I a dumbass who's missing something crucial here?

jobs,constantly overworked,Am I right to be annoyed about my job situation?,"I work part-time, and recently our store manager left. Since then, things have been a mess. Our district manager scheduled me and another girl to work 9 days in a row (I ended up doing 10) because we constantly have call-outs from other girls who treat the job like something they’ll do if they feel like it, not because they actually have to.

Our previous manager had this habit of hiring people with barely any availability — either because they’re lazy or they’re in college soon/already in college — which means there’s a constant shortage of people who can actually work. And anytime I’ve asked someone to cover for me, even for a short shift, no one ever steps up.

Now we have a new manager coming in, but she won’t start for another two weeks. So basically, we’re being expected to run the store in the meantime, with no extra pay or recognition.

On top of that, one of my coworkers who recently became a key holder has been asking me nonstop to cover her shifts. First she went on a cruise, then another trip, then her mom came to visit, then she got engaged, and now she’s leaving for another week — all within the last 2–3 weeks. And each time, she wants me to pick up multiple shifts for her. 

I originally took this part-time job so I could have more time for my own goals, but instead it’s been constant bullshit. I’ve already gone over my scheduled hours so many times. I’m not in the best place mentally right now, and I just got a second job, but no one seems to listen when I say my availability is limited. My schedule with this job barely lines up with my second job, and yet I keep getting asked to sacrifice more of my time.

I’m feeling overworked, taken advantage of, and like no one respects my time. Do I have the right to be annoyed, or am I overreacting?",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1mkzne4/am_i_right_to_be_annoyed_about_my_job_situation/,1754670008.0,BratzPrincessjulz,1mkzne4,advice_seeking
jobs,constantly overworked,Retaliation after putting in my two weeks,"Hi there! I just put in my two weeks today at my job at a pet store due to overworking and underpaying for the amount of work I do at my place of work. Constant rejected raises for all employees, taking hours but hiring more people, inconsistencies in how the place is ran, this place is a shit show.

I put in my two weeks with my manager this morning and a few hours later I got a write up about improper setup for isolation with a sick hamster from the owner. I found the hamster sick yesterday while cleaning enclosures and put him in a temporary holding container until I got done with cleaning everyone. I ran out of time to get him properly set up and let my coworker know that he needed to be set up properly. This morning he wasn’t. So I set him up properly. Then I got written up about it. Is this retaliation BS???

Giving context to this boss of mine, she tends to watch people who are leaving like a hawk, any mess ups? She’ll drop your pay to minimum wage (from 12 to 7.25), cut your hours, and write you up until you leave. 

I just wanna know if there’s anything I can do relating to any of this just so I am prepared if the other things she has done to others who have put in a two weeks. Or, am I fucked?

jobs,constantly overworked,Understaffed and overworked - now being asked to take on more tasks,"I (23F) have been working with a private company for just over a year. We are already a small team (originally 6 people) and are now down to 4 (including my team lead). The company also underwent a recall on their biggest product. The workload was absolutely insane, we were understaffed and our processes were constantly changing. The company refuses to hire anybody to bring us back to a normal sized team. So we’ve all taken on extra work, not to mention the workload when people are sick or on vacation.

Yesterday, my manager approached me about cross training to assist my team lead with her workload - to serve as a back up. There is no extra pay and of course more workload. The training itself will also take time away from my current tasks. I brought up all of these points to my manager but she’s still pushing it on me. She swears that it won’t be a lot of work, that it’s great to learn more about how the company works and that my other coworkers will help me if things get overwhelming. I don’t buy it.

If my team lead needs help, then the higher ups need to hire people to support her. It is honestly not my problem, I shouldn’t feel guilty for declining unnecessary work.. especially when no compensation is offered.

Anyone with corporate experience have advice or insight on the situation? I’m still new to this.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1mejt8m/understaffed_and_overworked_now_being_asked_to/,1754012606.0,Ok-Poem9255,1mejt8m,advice_seeking
jobs,constantly overworked,Second Year Tradesman Trying To Escape,"I'm a 26 year old male living in the Midwest.

I'm currently working as a (non-union) traveling millwright apprentice/laborer, and I am feeling very stuck. Long read here, I apologize in advance.

I work on 10 day stretches, I've never done work like this before, and 9/10 of journeymen on the job site don't speak English, so if there's nobody bilingual and free to work with me, I end up just helping out where I can and picking up trash and other grunt work. I'm not faulting the guys not speaking the same language as I, but when the foreman and other millwrights are discussing a plan and trying to come up with solutions, I'm not in the loop so I'm playing catch up once we get rolling. The language barrier has been a challenging hurdle, and I think it impedes my growth in this trade as well. I'm not expected to be a ""skilled"" laborer at this point, but even after a year it sometimes feels like I have made no progress in my abilities. The millwright trade with this contractor has you doing something different every day, so I have gotten better at what I do, but it feels only sparingly. 

(aside from residential flooring remodels, and the only skill I've learned from there that applies here is reading a measuring tape)

How I ended up here:

I have no college degree.

School wasn't convenient for me after high school due to me being a degenerate teenager and being kicked out of my parents house and having to figure it out. I completed two college courses but dropped out after a semester.

I sold insurance for two years and did well, but 22 year old me wanted more than phone calls and being cooped up in an office, so I left the insurance industry to sell residential flooring in a retail setting. I thought that I would get more fulfillment out of a more in-person role, but it wasn't easy being a young (non homeowner) selling a product I hadn't actually experienced myself.

I did *okay* at it, but I was just staying afloat and not really thriving in that setting, so I quit after about two years.

Eventually a staff agency recruiter saw my resume on Indeed and set me up on a temporary 12 month contract. (not temp to hire, I was told in the interview being hired as a full time employee was unlikely)
This role was a field project coordinator position for a large industrial project. I received and organized inventory, took meeting notes, progress photography and pictures, job site maintenance, (moving snow, filling in ruts, sweeping the concrete, putting up safety barricades/red tape, cleaned up trash), responded to RFIs, talked to superintendents and foremen every day to see if there was anything they needed that I could help with, etc. It was a role that required me to learn and do a lot, but I enjoyed it because my people skills and previous experience dealing with people and customers was used on the job site, so I didn't feel COMPLETELY lost, and I was able to adapt. After my contract ended I was looking for work, and I could've worked as an operator the plant we built, but my ex girlfriend at the time was moving out of the Midwest and didn't want me to take that job and I thought I would only do this until I found something in the same city as her. We split up shortly after I took this job anyways.

(I made the mistake of love over career, please spare me the grief, I know how stupid it was.)

Out of all of the other subcontractors on site the millwright trade seemed the most interesting, I had the best working relationship with their superintendent, and they offered the most money. I didn't have to work with them, but the thought of entering job search mode once again sounded exhausting so I took it. 

Unfortunately the taste of construction management I got has made me think that I'm capable of doing more, but the current job market tells me I'm under qualified for anything resembling that placement. 

I make $28 an hour right now which is significantly better than entry level jobs in the state I live in, but I'm miserable being away from home all the time. 

I don't want to keep traveling on these long stretches doing manual labor, but I also don't want to worry about making commission either. 

I understand that I will probably take a pay cut, and that's okay, but I also don't want to be struggling and that's the only reason I've stayed where I'm at for so long. 

I somewhat enjoy learning how to work with my hands, but it's not something I want to do forever. I don't like the blue collar culture of drinking, bragging about how overworked you are, hating your family/SO, and the constant job site dick measuring everyone's doing. 

I want to search for another job, but going through LinkedIn and Indeed feels hopeless, as the times I've applied to 100+ jobs (with cover letters) with matching qualifications and I've heard almost nothing back even after following up. I've had two interviews in the past year, one rejected me, the second interview I was contacted by a recruiter via LinkedIn, and I got to the final interview, but they went with another candidate. 
I've touched up my resume several times, but I fear that I just lack any valuable experience at all. 

I understand my resume shows that I have a track record of lack of long term commitment, while true, I know that if I found something that made me feel fulfilled and paid the bills, I would be content and not search elsewhere. I don't list the insurance experience anymore, nor do I disclose it in interviews due to the fact I'm not really looking for sales roles anymore.

I am torn between accepting where I'm at, and trying to find somewhere to work that has an actual ladder to climb, as the next step up is foreman, and the company I'm with doesn't really provide alternative paths. The best I could get out of this job is a journeyman's certification, but I just signed up for classes this fall. I don't know if I have four years of this left in me.

I'm sorry for rambling on but I wanted the Reddit experts to have full context. 

I know it's not too late for me to turn my life around, but I just don't know to do it realistically.

Should I tell white lies on my resume to get called for interviews?

Do I stay where I'm at and hate my life?

Do I continue to spend my very limited free time after work writing cover letters for hiring managers that don't even get past my resume?

Do I go back to school and pursue a degree online while working full time? 

I am so tired, I am so lost. Looking for advice, also kind of wanted to vent a little.

TLDR: I am in a traveling labor position that I hate. I want to escape, but I don't know if there's anything I'm qualified for so I'm rooting in it for now, but I don't want to root in it too long.",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1lw1yl6/second_year_tradesman_trying_to_escape/,1752116066.0,Broke_Boy_James,1lw1yl6,advice_seeking
jobs,constantly overworked,What would you do with my job?,"I work at a golf course. I’m the beverage cart girl on tournament days but all the other days I work behind the snack/beverage bar 9-6. I have so many complaints about this job and don’t really know whether I’m overreacting or what to do. First of all, my boss sexually harasses me on the daily, says some really graphic stuff. No matter how hard I deflect he finds a way to turn it into an innuendo about me “wearing a mini skirt and cleaning under his desk” or asking me to lift up my arms to prove I’m cold???? And yesterday I got a phone call handed to me from an employee working in our pro shop asking for me and hung up 15 seconds after I answered, very freaked out about that. I also have a stalker that shows up everyday I work, and followed me like halfway home in a golf cart once (I walk to work bc I live so close). But I have multiple upon multiple old men that harass me and drunk guys who stay too long and the ordinary stuff for a girl in my job I guess. And my other boss, just does not care to update me on anything happening. I am constantly kept after 6 because “we have an event tonight”. Today we had a birthday party I wasn’t prepared for, was never told about it. When I asked when they celebrate I was told 6 pm. My closing time. I’ve been so constantly overworked and disrespected by them and I don’t know whether quitting or doing something more serious is the right answer. I also need validation to know that I’m not just making this a bigger deal than it actually is. The golf course is owned by the city so there isn’t really like an HR department or anything.

jobs,don't know what to do with my life,"Resigned today, CEO wants to grill me tomorrow","I need some help, long story short i joined a mom and pop company 3 months ago as a sales manager but decided to resign today because:

- management yells profanities at staff
- poor planning where unrelated roles and tasks just drop into our laps
- CEO is a boomer who tried to argue with me on why i was taking a few days sick leave (i had a viral infection in my eyes that lasted 10 days, which is highly contagious and i even had a letter from the specialist but CEO still demanded i come to work or lose my job)
- i drive 1.5 hours each way from mon to fri and frankly am just sick of it.

Now the CEO and Vice wants to “interview” me tomorrow. What reasons should i use to justify me leaving? They are pretty vindictive so i dont want them to spread that “im the problem” when i have tried my best to accommodate and adapt to their ways. 

Edit: such amazing replies, thank you all! I feel that i should add more info (sorry for not doing it before)

- i am from a country in SE Asia
- We have rules that minimum notice period is 1 month 
- the interview tomorrow is not the exit interview, that happens on my actual last day with HR. Tomorrow’s meeting is mostly to understand why i am leaving which i find it weird to even make me go through this

Edit 2, Its OVER!

Firstly I want to thank everyone for sharing their thoughts and opinions, I didn't expect this to get over 1000 comments! I feel like i have to make some clarifications, so here we go

1. In my country, all full time employment has a standard contract where we have to provide anywhere between 1 to 3 months notice period upon resigning and if either side breaks that clause, then salary for those months need to be paid instead. So if I were to leave immediately, I would owe 1 month's salary to the company and i'm not taking that route

2. This interview is not the same as the exit itnerview that many were referring to, because that happens with HR. The CEO and Co wants to have a separate one to understand why I'm leaving 

3. Some of you think this story is fake because I said this mom and pop business has a HR team. I could have used the wrong term because this company has about 40 employees but is defintiely run in a mom and pop style where nothing gets done without the CEO's approval whether its accounting, marketing, development, etc. 

Now for the actual interview, both of them decided to shout my name across the office to ""discuss something with me"". As this is a small office, when they hear this it usually gets the rumor mills winding up because they know someone's leaving and this means me. I don't like having this kind of attention and wished they would have been more private about it but whatever i guess. 

Once inside, both of them started by offering me many quality of life improvements at work like offering work from home, additional bonus, etc. . They started smirking as though i was a beggar only out for money so i told them my reason to leave was personal and i did not want to discuss further than that, and that wiped the smiles off their faces. 

The whole thing ended with them wanting to pile on more stuff for me to do before i leave to make full use of me, i guess. A happy ending i would say and i felt much better going into it with everyone's advice here, so thanks again!

jobs,don't know what to do with my life,Stop treating interviews like dating. This isn’t a social club. It’s someone’s livelihood.,"Edit: 

So nearly every person that's commenting, this is commenting on the fact that I sound entitled, and I sound like I'm an awful person to work with. I was not the angle, I was trying to go. The truth is, I'm exhausted. I'm exhausted from trying to play the game and somehow never play It right. Exhausted from overanalyzing every interview after I've had it and really am picking apart 1 or 2 things. I've done I probably did wrong and thinking I'm going to get rejected because I said that one because I said that one thing wrong, even though I'm really trying, I'm really trying to be what the team needs. I have gone through so many final round interviews.

Yes, I'm frustrated. I'm frustrated at the fact that I could have seen myself succeeding in some of those jobs that I could have seen myself really being part of the team and really being happy and really being fulfilled in that job, but I get shut out because of something I can't control.

I am a woman in tech, and sometimes I feel like I get shut out because I'm a girl and all the other developers are boys, and they just treated like one big boys club. 

Oh my capability and I know what I can do and I know what I can bring to the team. I just get f****** nervous during interviews because I know so much. It's on the line, and I know I can do the job. I just I need to sell myself to these people who do I need to convince that I can do it.

Due to nerves, I probably say 1 or 2 things that come out sounding, stupid, or they come out sounding like completely wrong from what I was trying to say.

Maybe railing against cultural fit wasn't the right word for it. But maybe give people grace, if they seem nervous. Give people grace if they say one stupid thing, maybe consider the fact that they're nervous that their whole life is on the line. And maybe look past them saying one stupid thing.

3 of these 7 times have been because they chose someone else and I get it, it sucks. But I wish they would have given me clear answer as to why I wasn't chosen, because it's hard to improve when they don't tell you what you need to fix. 3 of those times they just closed the job opening, because they realize they can't bring on someone new, which is a new hell in its own way.

I guess my approach of coming at this with anger was not the best method. But somehow, someone in the comments, even after I make this edit, will claim that I'm whining or that I'm entitled or something of that nature. 

How is it entitled to feel like everyone deserves to earn a living that everyone deserves to live that everyone deserves to have some to have a house over their head, food in their mouth and a bed to sleep on.
 

Edit 2: 

For anyone assuming I act arrogant in interviews, I don’t. I know that is a one way street to a rejection. I am not that stupid. I’m not cocky when I interview. I’m anxious, respectful, and trying my best. What you’re seeing in this post is frustration. I’m sick of being told I was a great candidate and still hearing “we went with someone else.” I’m tired of being Edit: For anyone assuming I act arrogant in interviews — I don’t. I’m not cocky when I interview. I’m anxious, respectful, and trying my best. What you’re seeing in this post is frustration. I’m sick of being told I was a great candidate… and still hearing “we went with someone else.” I’m tired of being number two through five because guess what? It's either the winner or loose out on everything. 

Why would you pick number two if number one had so many more qualifications you didn't even think you need, so now the job expands, and then you still lose. Now you're not even qualified anymore.

I am burned out from going through this process over and over and over again and never seeing any results other than a rejection because someone else was better. 

It is probably my nerves causing me to not make it that far more often but when I do I always have to remember to not get too excited about a possible yes because I have been here soo many times before and gotten told no soo many times.

I just want one yes.

***This is going to piss people off but it needs to be said.***

Tired of hearing “culture fit” as a rejection reason when the candidate could clearly do the job. Tired of interviews being treated like a vibe check instead of a skills assessment. Tired of people being rejected because they don’t act exactly like the rest of the team, even though diversity of thought is what companies claim to value.

This isn’t dating. In dating, rejection stings but your rent isn’t on the line. Your ability to afford food or pay medical bills doesn’t hinge on someone deciding you're ""not the right vibe.""

Hiring shouldn’t be about who you’d grab drinks with. It should be about who can do the job, who’s trying, and who just needs the damn chance.

**Because that ""no"" you hand out? It might be the reason someone can’t make rent. It might be the reason they go into debt. It might be the difference between someone keeping their home or losing it.**

So next time you’re about to reject a candidate, ask yourself:
**Is this actually about qualifications, or are you just uncomfortable with someone who isn’t exactly like you?**

jobs,don't know what to do with my life,My parents don't understand that I can't get a job with my degree ,"I graduated from university with honors in German and English linguistics, specializing in teaching. I completed a year-long practicum in Austria, and I have work experience as a tutor. During my time at university, I did everything possible to gain practical experience: I was the head of the student union committee, and, together with my travel lecturer, I co-founded a community. This role taught me invaluable skills such as marketing, administration, management, digital design, copywriting, and communication.

Now, here’s the problem: I’ve been trying to find a full-time job, but no one hires me because I lack ""relevant"" experience. I’ve applied for roles requiring foreign language skills, only to be rejected with feedback like, ""Although your language skills are excellent, we chose a candidate with field-specific experience.""

I eventually found a part-time teaching position, but it pays a mere $120 a month—barely enough to survive. I still live with my parents, but they don’t understand my situation. When I read job postings for roles like sales manager or customer support—positions that claim to require no prior experience—my parents get furious. They insist I should only work in a role where I can fully utilize my language skills.

For example, my sister got her first job without any experience, but that was because my mom, who owned an HR agency, pulled strings to get her a position in sales. My sister didn’t have a degree or relevant knowledge, but she got a chance because of my mom’s connections. Meanwhile, there’s a growing trend in the job market where employers don’t want to invest in training new hires. My parents, however, seem stuck in a fantasy where being smart and hardworking is enough to land any job you want.

Instead of understanding my reality, they shout at me for acknowledging how tough things really are. What frustrates me most is that I’ve always had to do everything on my own. I worked tirelessly to pass my exams and get into university without tutors, earning a free spot through sheer effort. I secured scholarships to study abroad, graduated with honors, and worked hard to gain extracurricular experience. I even managed to support myself financially during my studies, never asking my parents for money.

Recently, my mom let slip something that stung deeply: ""It’s easier with the second child—you don’t have to try, and things just work out."" That’s exactly how it feels. My parents supported my sister’s education abroad (she dropped out), helped her get her first job, and even buy her gifts and electronics. Meanwhile, if I want a birthday present, I have to research the options, find the best deal, and order it myself—only to have them refuse to approve it or pay for it. As a result, I’ve gone three birthdays without receiving a present.

It feels like people expect me to solve their problems while offering nothing in return. This extends beyond my family—I’ve never had a friend or boyfriend who truly cared for me the way I care for others. And yet, I’m not unattractive. I’m loyal, friendly, and I make people feel good. Sometimes, I suspect I might be autistic, which could explain why I struggle to be understood.

I know there’s no space here for advice—I’m simply looking for compassion and to hear someone’s thoughts about my story. Maybe one day, I’ll find a job that matches my skills, earn enough to move out, and create a life I’m proud of. My parents aren’t bad people, but they’re not helpful or supportive either. It’s exhausting to always be blamed for things beyond my control. Still, I’m trying to stay positive in these difficult times, and I wish the same for everyone else.

jobs,don't know what to do with my life,Finally escaped unemployment. Now I don't do anything.,"I spent 2 years unemployed. It was hell. My life was drive for the food delivery apps, spam applications, drive for the apps, applications, go to bed. Over 1000 applications and I finally got a job. I want to begin with saying I feel amazing mentally speaking having a job again. It was destroying me, the anxiety, the overwhelmed feelings, the depression, the feeling like I didn't deserve to enjoy anything until this obligation was handled, like I was wasting time. I feel great now. My mental is doing so much better. My general anxiety has dropped by like 75% and my social anxiety by damn near 100%. I feel better about myself. This was the longest I have ever been unemployed since I was 13. And I grew up with a mother who at times worked 2-3 jobs to make ends meet so I just don't do well without one. This current job market is hell.

However, now on my days off I do nothing. The job itself is nothing crazy, full time, active, around people, okay pay, I'm a merchandiser. I stopped being sore and tired after the second week and in fact now I have much more energy. My sleep has improved too. I also get a three day weekend. So, everything is in order to where I feel I should be able to utilize and truly appreciate free time. And yet, I'm almost suffering from couch lock (bed lock). I just lay in bed and doom scroll and distract myself with video games I don't even like and do some house work which eats up all of 2 hours. There's certainly shit I could be doing which I previously thoroughly enjoyed such as fishing. But I just cant seem to get myself going. I'm not tired, mentally or physically. I don't understand why this is happening. While unemployed it felt like I was wasting my life if I did anything for fun. Now with a job not doing anything for fun I feel like I'm wasting my life. How ridiculous is that? This has always been an issue I've had. My last job I worked 6-7 days a week and whenever I had a day off I just rested inside. Now though I get half the week off and I still do nothing.

Does anyone have advice, or has anyone been through similar? I do have more goals in order and getting this job was only step one for me, but now I am beginning to worry that when I've tackled these goals and made it where I want to be, that I'll still find myself going through this and feel like it was all for nothing.

EDIT:

There's way more replies than I expected, and I've read a lot. I didn't realize so many would be able to relate to some of the things I mentioned. Thank you everyone. I will continue reading and try to respond to some a little after work tomorrow.

As far as the gap goes, I decided to start testing whatever I could and eventually put down that I've been driving for the apps. That turned the gap from 2 years into like 5 weeks. No clue if that actually helped. But I've done all the usual stuff like even walking in IRL and pestering management at places and only this seems to have made the difference. I've also applied to just about everything from janitorial, retail, trades, unskilled labor, coding, to office jobs. Basically if I qualified, had any prior experience, or believed I could learn on the job, I applied.

  
Update: 

Thank you everyone. I clonked out right when I got home yesterday, just read everything here. I'm going to force myself out of the house this weekend even if all I do is lay in the grass and float some bait out at one of my spots for an hour (I prefer moving a lot and using lures when I fish). I've thought a lot about everything you guys have said and I'm realizing I more or less spent an entire 24 months in almost a fight or flight mode non stop. I didn't feel at ease or relaxed for a second. I think it became my new norm so I just didn't notice it, and those of you saying I need to just let myself chill and come down is what all of this is. It makes sense as I realize this.

I will admit I have a horrible habit of burning myself out always wanting to go 100 in all areas. I think being stuck at 0, in an almost sort of limbo, while knowing what I needed to do and what I want in life but stagnating despite my best efforts and now suddenly having traction but being mentally exhausted from the past 2 years is what's going on here. Like I'm overly eager to finally just GO GO GO and put in work and to let myself enjoy life. I'm gonna take it slow, small waves over time for a big impact. I can get my social life rebuilt, get into some classes, get back into hobbies like fishing, but do it gradually rather than all at once.",1211,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1fscgu3/finally_escaped_unemployment_now_i_dont_do/,1727637930.0,NorthPleasant6581,1fscgu3,advice_seeking
jobs,career change at 30/40,I have some good news for ya'll,"Hello;

I am top of my field and have been for some time.

I share this all NOT to brag, but to levelset. If its hard for me, its sure as HECK hard for everyone else.

I've been in the game for 15 years and tend to look for new roles every 2-3 years if not promoted/incentivized to stay (Im in a field that prizes ""up to dateness""). I've been looking for a new role for nearly a year and a half.

It's been brutal. Torturous. Truly awful. I've never seen anything like it in my career. Ghosting. 7-8 interviews. Then they decide to go with other candidates. Next steps that never manifest. Insulting, lowball offers.

The past month and a half, things are changing. Recruiters are knocking, for the first time in a long time. Ive got at least 3 interviews booked for next week (and an offer in hand). The offer wasn't easy: I had a seven layer interview process and needed to present a deck (25 slides) I made, to their CMO -- and I also had the endorsement of their head of sales. But its an offer for one of \*the\* most important AI companies.

Its less than I was making four years ago, but its more than I've BEEN making recently, if that makes sense (I took a 40% paycut in the darkest of times). This brings me back up to about 30%.

**Advice, FWIW:**

* Apply to listings posted within that same day
* See if you know anyone that works there to vouch for you
* Be aware of the changing tides; AI companies are emerging and taking over. IE: ""Field AI"" is a new company replacing traditional field ops; Salesforce has a huge field management platform - this new company will eat their lunch. There's a thousand cases like this. Find the disruptors.
* AI companies are starting to use language about mandatory ""humans in the loop"" to counteract misbehavior. I dont know what this role will be called, but it will be important. Data science, etc.
* Robotics, welding, etc. If you are truly skill-less and lost, trade school -- theres always a demand for welders, electricians. Robotics is here. Get ahead of it -- community college, whatever has a path forward. What do robots need? Metal. Wires. Electronic components. This is an industry that will need technicians, engineers.

All of this to say: if I am a canary, then it's time to try, try again. Things seem to be on the upswing.

Good luck out there!!!!!",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1m34z3c/i_have_some_good_news_for_yall/,1752851605.0,erinmonday,1m34z3c,advice_seeking
jobs,career change at 30/40,What is the cure for chronic tardiness?,"I considered putting this in an autism sub but figured I'd try here first 

I (29M, ASD, ADD, GAD, MDD, did I get them all?) think my employment is about to come to an abrupt end. I'm sure I can get a new job but I don't know how I'm gonna keep one with my tardiness issues.

Short background:
I work in a very demanding field, there was an incident at work that seems to have broke me. Sure there was the odd late day here and there before but nothing abnormal, now it's pretty much every day and not just the usual 5-20 minutes because traffic or something, it's more like 1-3 hours... And has been for nearly 4 years now.

I have tried alarms, automatic lights, Ridgid schedules, loose schedules, alternate schedules, spent tens of thousands on therapists, therapy's, doctors and meds. After 8 months of being unable to heal I changed jobs hoping a clean slate would fix things, it didn't.

The new job had some good things about it though, boss man for the most part didn't care when I showed up as long as I got my 40 hours. The schedule isn't all that regular there to begin with, the past 2 weeks I've clocked out between 6pm and 2am and I don't really know when I'll be off till about 30 minutes before, pretty hard to stick to a routine with that. But as mentioned, things aren't going well now and I don't think I'll be there much longer.

I'm considering changing career paths but need to fix my tardiness, I know autistics are more prone to burnout but this is kinda ridiculous. The one thing I haven't tried is the take 2 months off reset that some autistic experts recommend but who has that kind of flexibility? Does it even work? I don't know what else to try at this point.

If anyone has heard of something like this before or has tips or suggestions of how to make it back to a more normal punctuality situation I'd be very interested to hear.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1l5mh5c/what_is_the_cure_for_chronic_tardiness/,1749307490.0,Charming_Try_8928,1l5mh5c,advice_seeking
jobs,career change at 30/40,Do the older redditors in this subreddit who have struggled for footing feel like age/lack of success by a certain point hurt them?,"This is a venting post, I feel very alone and confounded. 



Do any of you find yourself over 30-40 and feel like your inability to gain footing like your peers has forfeited the rest of your life, especially in the post-covid economy? 

It's a cycle with diminishing returns as one ages....get laid off, b/c it seems many companies ""spring clean"" now, often without warning or real understanding how someone in a ""not-important"" role can save their job, or avoid that fate...be terrified and frantically look for new work...start the cycle again. I've never gotten settled in a job or been treated like I'm someone worth keeping, promoting, and cultivating; I'm always hired in a ""new role for this company"" that is poorly defined, low respect, insecure, and clerical.

I *did* do good work for my previous company, and there was no hope of promotion or training to do something more universally valuable, nor was the experience impressive to employers on that basis. I should be senior, based on years of experience, but I have never been trained to be ""senior"" anything. 

Re: ""footing"": I graduated in the recession of 2000, didn't get my first ""real"" job until 7 years after graduated (wasted a lot of time self-employed/in grad school for something I did not want to do), and after 10 years in the labor market, am still fighting for entry level admin assistant jobs in a horrible economy. I have 7+ years of experience, but I have never been promoted or treated to do anything but the same admin job, for years on end, or else, I am a temp, trained in no real ""career"" where I am promoted to the next level. 

I spent 5 years as a temp with a company (1.5 of which were temp -company strung me along but I didn't have good judgment and liked my coworkers/was afraid of how I'd be treated in a new job) doing about 20-30 stable tasks within ERP software and training my team.

I was fired from that job in Aug 2023 and psychologically, I've never recovered from the fact the manager the let me go relished in disclosing to my team how much he disliked me. He did things I regret not documenting. I was too ashamed and paranoid.

And now I am working for a large corporation with a team of 4 people, my manager blindsided me with a PiP for contradictory things after a year of continously shifting or incomplete guidelines for tasks in our manual, for ""failure of competence"" on tasks I was explicilty told I could not do...it's a character assassination, with weekly checkins.


Even now I reflect I'm on reddit after doing a 10 hour day instead of applying for jobs, because I am **severely** depressed, and spend all day paralyzed with rage and self-hatred and fear about this situation. It occurred to me the PiP time window is so my manager can find a replacement. 

I realized at some point that even if I meet the performance/case quota requirements, she wants to terminate me. She berates me for emailing project managers for sending requests to deactivate customers, something she has warned me not to do without justification I can document reasonably. There is no set guide for what is a mistake, and what isn't. It's humiliating. I don't even know if I can document this. 

I can look at others' work and see they're making similar mistakes or - reasonably - communicate with anyone asking them to make a decision, so as to justify something like flagging a customer. I can do no right here, even when I follow procedure. 

Basically I've never worked a job that wasn't low pay, low respect, unimportant, trained on a shallow level, clerical and judged by parameters - KPIs, SLAs, reports - hidden from me as part of surveillance, but where ""mistakes"" supporting sales are still catastrophic and cause for termination. 

I want to clarify that I can write a professional email; I take notes; I comply with all trainings and ask to record to refer back to. I follow standard operating procedures and send confirmation emails when a senior person asks for notification of a task. I try to work well with people.

My back is damaged (complication of surgery) and I have 24/7 pain from scoliosis and arthritis.  It has genuinely ruined the rest of my life. It is a bigger problem than anything else - if I could do five days onsite easily, I might be doing ok. As most office jobs return to 5 days onsite, the mistake is more than I can handle psychologically too. (There is no solution I've found and I'm not sure there is one that doesn't involve taking medication that inhibit being able to work, or side effects like massive weight gain and cystic acne.) 

I have struggled since college graduation and every year, I make a life mistake or find myself in another horrible job I take because there are no options, for low pay, and poorly defined expectations. I'm an adult and I've never been ""chosen"" to work for a company I liked, that treated me like i was valuable. I've never been hired by a company that promoted or valued me.

I have not been ""comfortable"" except in a temp role in 2018, and that company refused to hire me, even though there were never any objections to my performance and my manager said I met the goals she set. 

I have no close friends, I have no life outside my job. I have never taken a vacation, and in every job I've been in since 2017-2018, I was either a temp or so afraid to take a medical day or a day off, as I see ""settled"" employees doing. I don't have a life outside of medical problems and relentless fear about being out of a job and the stigma of long-term unemployment. When people ask what I do for a living, all I feel is shame when I listen to people over 35 talk about being managers, VPs...established. Financially established so they can negotiate a life and conditions of working. Validated. 

I don't know anyone else my age or who went to college/went to school with me that has these problems.

And I know I should have regained new skills by now...I've found on weekends I physically can't because I use that time to clean, see doctors, or do other things I can't doing the week. I lose weekends to recovering psychologically from jobs have no future. 

I'm meeting with my manager every week and she just changes the parameters of what a ""mistake"" is, and it hits me - this is happening because you are just a dumb secretary, and you can't even do that right. This is not a ""good"" job. The fact you're in a position where the demands of the role change every six weeks, there is no training, and you're catching it on the fly from a senior staff member your manager says doesn't want to work with you goes to the nature of a low level job.

I realize this is a long post, but I have no one to talk about this in real life.",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1jpe8vy/do_the_older_redditors_in_this_subreddit_who_have/,1743561553.0,trudycampbellshats,1jpe8vy,advice_seeking
jobs,career change at 30/40,Warehouse Worker Looking for a Job With More Consistent Hours,"30 yr. old male, married with 2 kids and 2 more on the way.

I work in warehouses, mostly for manufacturers but also some retail. I am looking to learn more about business management as that seems like a natural progression for my career: I have plenty of experience with the hands on aspects of warehousing including operating heavy machinery including forklifts, moving boxes, managerial tasks like resolving Inventory discrepancies, problem solving at a leadership level, running a safety committee, etc. What I'm missing is proper training on managing people (although I have done it before) and knowledge about running a business including the accounting aspect of Inventory Management. 

My main apprehension with pursuing a business management degree is my priorities for my job have changed. I am a lot less concerned about what I do at work and more concerned about how long I'm there and how much I'm paid to do it. Warehousing is a crap-shoot when it comes to reasonable and consistent hours unless you get in with just the right company or just the right industry and even then you better hope the company doesn't grow because then leadership might change and their values might no longer support work-life balance. The negative experiences I've had with my hours at warehouses mean I'm a little traumatized and might be happier never stepping foot in a warehouse again but I'm also anxious about stepping into a whole new field that may have drawbacks I've never even considered (Devil you know and all that).

It seems like there's a lot of Procurement Manager positions in state jobs (I live in a state capital) which might be something I could be really good at by combining my experience with a business management degree.

Unless I'm blessed enough to get into a position that I'm passionate about (not even sure what that would be), or that really makes a direct positive impact on people, or find a job I can take my family to, I'm looking for something that's low stress with not only reasonable hours (40hrs/wk) but also consistent hours that don't change. 7:00a-3:30p is great because it allows for doctor appointments without taking time off, but as long as it's day shift, 8 hours a day, Mon-Fri, I'm not going to be picky.

So what do you think? Should I completely abandon the experience I have in warehousing and go for something in a completely different field like Dental Hygienist or teaching or should I stick with business management? Or do you think there's a career path other than business management that would take advantage of my experience in warehouses?

It should be noted that I enjoy physical activity at my job but I don't want something super physically demanding like moving boxes all day which is why I'm tending towards an office or managerial job. I'd rather have a job where I have the energy to work out afterwards than a job where I don't have to work out because it's physically active.

  
TL;DR: I have a lot of experience in warehouses and Inventory but want something that will never require more than 40 hours a week of me. Could get a degree in business management but I'm hesitant to stay in warehousing. What career could I choose that would take advantage of my extensive warehouse experience or should I just start over completely? If I should start over, what would be a good industry or job position that pays well ($25/hr.+) and has consistent hours? It should be low-stress but I'm fine with something that challenges my intellect.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1hzdbqe/warehouse_worker_looking_for_a_job_with_more/,1736651280.0,all_fair,1hzdbqe,advice_seeking
jobs,career change at 30/40,Not prospering?,"Is anybody else tired of not prospering? This is going to be a bit of a rant but I feel I need to write this down. I was active duty United States Air Force for four years. After my time there I got out and used my benefits to obtain my bachelors degree. Covid hit during my last semester in school and the hiring surge started. I got a job after graduating as a supervisor at a logistics company, and was then able to get a management position at another company 7 months into that role, fully remote! It felt like the decisions I made in life actually benefited me down the road. Unfortunately, as we all know, there was a crunch after the hiring boom and I sadly didn't have enough tenure to avoid it. I was laid off from a job I really loved, like many so many had been. Finding another job was tough, and I ultimately decided to work for myself (I had been a DJ while in the military and during college so I did that at a bar). The money was ok, but the lack of benefits (PTO, 401K, Medical ect.) made taking any time off difficult and stressful, and the late nights were taking a toll on my relationship. I ultimately got a job as a non-appropriated funds Federal Employee. I took a massive pay cut, hoping to get my foot in the door down the line for a better Federal job. Not only that, but I have gone from a managerial role to essentially an associate.

I have sent hundreds of applications, Federal and private sector, hoping to get back ""on track"" as it were, with no luck whatsoever. My current job is about a 40 minute commute both ways, riddled with toxic employees and child like work politics. I performed well enough to score the highest possible on my annual review, but the awards bonus is a really only a  couple hundred bucks (better than nothing I know, but still). 

I am at that point in my life were I want to propose to my partner. I want to buy her a ring (literally just a basic one), I want children, a respectable career, chances to travel, and build my savings account. I legitimately cannot afford these things right now, regardless of how hard I work. Simply put, I am not prospering at all. I know there must be others here with a similar story, and others who have it far worse. I am generally a pretty positive guy but I just have this feeling that unless something changes, things are only going to get worse. I know the economy eps and flows, but this feels especially difficult. For me, it feels like my earning potential was squeezed and the more time I don't show upward mobility, the larger the gap grows between myself and those with ""X years of upper lever experience.""

What are your thoughts? Is this just the 30 something year old struggle, or is there something else going on? Are we being gaslight nationwide into believing that things are fine? Are there any policies that need to enacted to help combat the prevalence of ghost job postings and outsourcing jobs? At what point do we start marching? Should we just wait it out?

jobs,career change at 30/40,"What more, eh? The Struggle is real.","The small part about me - I am a fresh 29-year-old Grad in Cyber Security Management, obtained a First Class Honours, and have work experience in Telecommunications and Retail that is not related to this industry.

48 Applications for roles around InfoSec, Cyber Sec Analyst, SOC T1 and Cybercrime.

40 Auto-Rejections, Ghosting and Role closures.

This leaves 8 interview stages, that I have documented on Glassdoor.

Out of the eight, five made it to the final stages.

I have been rejected for *lack of experience (LOE*), and funnily enough one for *lack of passion*

So, let's look at the LOE;

My first interview was fantastic, it was very much between me and another candidate and the diligence team from the company overturned the hiring manager's decision due to the needed resources to train me over someone with four months of industry experience and said that should the role open again, I will be contacted first to see if I am within the market and even the hiring manager reached out to say that he believed I will have a successful future and wouldn't be surprised if he was one day to be working under me (Amazing!!).

My second was that I didn't show enough passion for the role and I was inclined to disagree I discussed this in length with them and I said that the questions asked for this Graduate role were questions from all over cyber security, some even being CISO level which they apologised for because this was a new role and this was the first hiring status for the role and since then have changed the hiring process and from what I understand have asked more questions around the role you would expect from a passionate grad.

Third and Fourth were roles that were outside my scope, and I was looking at the roles as a potential career path, these worked great but again LOE was the final crunch where I had been told that I was one of the best candidates they had ever interviewed, and I ticked every box (yes including a passion for the field) but LOE took president.

For this final one (to this post) I underwent a three-stage interview process, one aptitude test, one initial interview and a final on-site interview. Sounds small? Ah, the test took an hour and the first interview was scheduled to be 30 minutes, but took over an hour on a positive note. I was moved to the third and final stage, which took me to travel from one area of the country to another which I wouldn't usually apply for that unless it was something I wanted, and it was. This interview was scheduled after lunch and expected to be no more than two hours but took three hours and this was on a positive note.

Today I got an email saying that I was not to be offered the role. An EMAIL After 14 hours of prep work, 6 hours of interviewing and some understandable hours of travel.

I wasn't given any feedback on how they came to the decision, I have sent an email back for information but I am yet to hear anything.

These may sound like a mix of good and bad experiences but the mental toll on this is exhausting. With every rejection, both the bad and the good I am slowly feeling less and less passionate about the field, roles and application processes and I fear that I will soon wither away from thinking that I am capable, skilled and good enough and it is the positive ones that hurt more because there is no room for development, or potential to try and rescue a rejection.

I do everything, I tailor my cover letters, and CV and reach out to various members of the team and hiring manager to show my interest, passion and desire to work for them, I even email the hiring manager or talent co-ordinator after every stage to thank them and to just re-iterate the excitement for the opportunity and go over any areas I fell short on to give more of a picture of how I take constructive feedback.

What more can anyone do? Aside from more certifications and free work.

jobs,career change at 30/40,Wanting to Career pivot into a Data Analyst from Recruitment,"I want to preface this and give a bit of context.

I'm 28M, and have worked in recruitment full-time for the past 3 years. I currently make £40,000 - £45,000 p/a depending on commission. I appreciate this is a fair salary for someone my age and I'm grateful to have a job which keeps me afloat. After a few years, I feel my position isn't stimulating enough in a sense of gradually seeing improvement. To be frank, it doesn't take much skill to be a recruiter. My manager is a very self-proclaimed school drop-out who is making well over 6 figures.

  
On the other hand, I took up my degree in Sports Psychology, graduated as covid hit, fell into recruitment and the rest of history. However, I have a real knack for data, computers and anything tech. I've always been very tech literate right from a very young age, very analytical which was helpful throughout my degree and analysing studies critically, pulling them apart. 



Now, I've decided I need to make the change before it's ""too late"". However, I have bills to pay, a car to run, a girlfriend to appease and much more living costs. While I can pay everything on a salary closer to £28,000 - £30,000, and money isn't particularly as issue - I'm not in a position to pack up my career and pump everything into learning a new craft. 

  
What is the best way I can learn how to become a data analyst, or rather the skills to make myself marketable to get a data analyst position, whilst working 50 hours a week? I am happy to sacrifice weekends and evenings for the forseeable to make this happen, but I need to know what path I should take, or if anyone has any recommendations for (ideally free) courses I can do in my spare time to achieve this.

jobs,go back to school,I tried quitting and my employer rejected it,"I work PRN at a hospital. I decided to find other employment because the next school semester is starting. When I started the job it was for dayshift but now they're only offering overnight shifts for me, and personally I can't do that and go to classes. So I found a new job that's closer, has better hours (they're not open overnight), and pays significantly more.

On 08/08 I submitted my resignation through their portal. It was to be sent to all my higher ups. Well today 08/14 my supervisor called me, left a message, and texted me at like 08:30 in the morning (I was asleep and this woke me up) saying they just now got it and they rejected it as they assumed it was a mistake.

I explained it was not, I resigned and my last day had been 08/05. I said that because that was literally the last day I was scheduled and I'm not scheduled again until 08/21. So I'm literally done. She said that's not valid either and that's not how it works. It literally is, I  know I submitted my resignation technically 13 days before my next scheduled shift, but I already start my new job that week and will not be attending. Her attitude and rejecting my resignation is not helping her case.

Anxiety is through the roof, I want to curl up in a ball and cry bc I swear I didn't do anything wrong.

update: She called me and I actually answered bc I was tired of the catty back and forth. It basically boiled down to her wanting to know why, where I was moving to, what the job is, and what the job description is. She then asked that I email her a written statement with all of that basically saying ""it's me not you"" so that they can say their retention plan is still working...",11123,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1es3p1a/i_tried_quitting_and_my_employer_rejected_it/,1723647288.0,ThrowRAlobotomy666,1es3p1a,advice_seeking
jobs,go back to school,Boss denied my vacation time because other employees are students,"I understand if I were to be asking for the time off two weeks prior to it but with nearly two months notice and little to no issues with me the entire time I’ve worked here I figured he’d try to work with me a bit more. I’ve been here since January, and since I’m just a cashier I figured my 33hrs a week would be easily covered as they have been for every other employees. He’s also talked about making me shift lead even though I am the second newest cashier out of 6. 

I’m going on the trip either way, but any advice for moving forward would be great. 

Additional info, there’s currently a coworker who’s only getting back next week from a two and a half month vacation. Im not sure if he’s taking her return into consideration.
It’s only a ‘part time’ position and no one gets over 40hrs a week, including the managers and shift leads. Every girl I asked to help cover isn’t getting close to 40hrs, they all work 30 or less.   

Hope I’m not being unreasonable, but losing a job over this would suck. :/  October is just the best time for my great grandmother as well as my family in Arkansas. I’m going to be going to back to school next year so it just isn’t in the cards for us if it isn’t now.

jobs,go back to school,unemployment for new grads is spiking. something’s off.,"ok so i've read this [article](https://www.theatlantic.com/economy/archive/2025/04/job-market-youth/682641/?gift=o6MjJQpusU9ebnFuymVdsJ1qwI70CnAkjDXBfrYqvHw) on the atlantic... something weird is going on with the job market for recent grads

new data shows unemployment for young college grads is like **5.8%** rn. even fresh mbas from fancy schools are struggling to get jobs. and law school apps are spiking again (classic recession move lol)

**why? a few things might be happening:**

1. the market never *fully* bounced back after covid or even 2008 tbh  .
2. college degrees just don’t hit like they used to — less of a golden ticket now .
3. and yeah… **ai**. it’s not replacing *everyone* yet, but it’s definitely starting to nibble at those entry-level white-collar jobs. you know, the ones that involve reading, summarizing, reporting... ai eats that for breakfast.

plus, companies are trying to cut costs, automate more, and skip hiring big junior teams.

no need to panic (yet), but if you’re a recent grad or hiring one — might be time to rethink how we’re preparing for this new landscape .

I want to get back to it just because I don’t want to stay in my defeatist mindset and I need to keep broadening my skills. I know that’s just the way things are. That being said, I do want to know others’ insights.

jobs,go back to school,I have 4 part time job opportunities while going to school and need advice,"Hello! I (29 F) am about to go back to school full time for mathematics and I have 4 part time job opportunities and am really confused on what to do. So right now I am working a full time sales job that can be very high stress and I am working a bartending job 2 days a week. School starts end of August and am so stressed trying to figure out what to do for work my head is spinning. 

My work opportunities:
1. My current bartending job 2-3 days a week. Not sure what the average tips would look like since I haven’t worked there during the winter but I have committed to this one. 
2. Another bartending gig on Sundays (100$-200$ per shift). I’ve worked at this job before and it’s pretty reliable and can sometimes be amazing tips. One time I made 700$ in one shift.
3. I have another bartending job opportunity that would most likely be only during football season on busy saturdays and maybe sundays (I would double with #2 job) 
4. I can stay for 2-4 shifts a month at my current sales job but it would only be 18$ an hour (non-commission/no bonuses). I technically a “helper” and not technically a sales person but I ask as one. I just never wanted to move into commission only cause I didn’t want to rely on it 

I know I am making this way more complicated than it needs to be. And then I am stressed out about making the wrong choice and screwing myself. I want to make the most money I can but also make school my top priority. 
Any advice would be so appreciated, also if there is a better subreddit for this please let me know! Thanks

jobs,go back to school,Finally got my first job offer in 7 months.. and I’m extremely disappointed. ,"Got laid off in April, been unemployed since. Finally decided to start looking at retail positions, since I just desperately need a job at this point. Applied for several positions at Best Buy, and after three interviews I finally got offered a job… part time $15/hr. I expected more like $17, and full time. But this is barely more than unemployment was giving me. 

Before I lost my jobs I was making 100k as an animation editor from my home office. This is just degrading and frustrating. I feel defeated, like a failure.

Everyone’s congratulating me and I’m just like… for what? I’m 34 years old and I’m going to get a job a 16 year old does after school for some extra cash. I hate this, I’m so tired of it. I don’t want to do this, especially during the holidays. 

Edit: I don’t mean to sound rude, there’s NOTHING wrong with a retail job. I’m sorry if it came off that way. But I have multiple degrees, a decent portfolio, and 10+ years of experience. It feel like an absolute failure going back to a part time retail store job at $15. It feels like I wasted my time and money on my education.

Edit 2: Omg yes obviously I have been looking for jobs in my field since day one of being laid off, I’m sorry I didn’t mention it I just kinda thought that was fucking obvious. I didn’t sit around for 7 months.

jobs,go back to school,I'm quitting,"Edit #2: Who the hell told on me (jokes)?? My boss just sent a calendar invite for me to have 5 days off. Someone must've snitched. 😂

Edit: I'm including some extra information given the insane negative backlash I received.

1) My current job consists of one boss. The owner. No HR department, no supervisors, nobody. Just her. I was warned by many other people to not work with her, but I ignored the warnings because she likes me. She's verbally abusive, manipulative, and nasty to my coworkers. I haven't had any days off from my promised 3 weeks of PTO because she always has a crisis at work that I'm obligated to help with because my only other coworker is incompetent. 

2) My husband still has his job. His income is enough for our very humble life in Kansas. We have a safety cushion. He supported me throughout law school financially when he was making even less money. I assure those of you worried about my marriage because I'm selfishky quitting that it's okay.

3) It was actually my husband that suggested I quit. I came home one day in absolute tears. My frustrations with my boss had led me to tears that went on for hours. He couldn't handle seeing me that way. He set up a plan for me to quit if I wanted to. 

4) I've already had two interviews and several other correspondences with potential employers. I understand the job market is hard for some right now, but I've not had any issues on my end in securing contacts. Stop worrying about a random person you don't know. 

I've been preparing myself mentally and spiritually to quit my toxic job. I have nothing lined up, but I'm confident that with the closing of this door, a better will open. 

I've missed out on so much because of this job. My husband surprised me with COLDPLAY tickets, and I couldn't go. My younger sister wanted to go to Spain together for her graduation, but I couldn't because of this job. I'm too young to be withering away.

Last time I tried to quit, I got reeled back in with an all-expense paid trip and a hefty raise. I really hope my boss doesn't try to rope me back in again.

Giving her my two weeks on pay day this week. 

Wish me luck y'all. ",484,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1lz0iu0/im_quitting/,1752432575.0,VividPayment6450,1lz0iu0,advice_seeking
jobs,go back to school,Feedback requested. I've had a couple of people in my family lose their job (two in one household) and it got me thinking. They are desperate and unsure how they are going to pay their next rent without resorting to moving back in with mum and dad. I'd love to know what other think.,"Sorry for the long read but I would appreciate your feedback. I'm semi retired now and want to try and help. I'm really glad I'm not job hunting right now.

Recently a couple of people that are really close to me have lost their jobs. They are really struggling to get back into the workforce. 

While I was trying to help them, I did some searching on Reddit for ideas and noticed heaps (and heaps) of people are losing their jobs right now. In the news they say a lot of it is because of AI and cutbacks etc. I'm also seeing a lot of people are leaving school and unable to get their first job (no experience and no roles available)

Anyway, my son in law is in his late 40's and is overqualified for most jobs or doesn't even get an interview because there are so many applicants. He's getting quite desperate. He's had to dumb down his CV from director of sales to sales manager to even get interviews. It's quite rough out there, and everything I read indicates it's going to get worse.

In my past life, I used to write online courses for a living (think corporate training, onboarding stuff, skill-building, stuff). I've also been quite successful in a couple of businesses.

So I’ve been toying with the idea of using my course-building brain to build something that might be able to help people. I think I can get some local government support or sponsorship so I can make it free. (I'm not trying to sell you anything. I haven’t even set up a website)

The format I've been thinking about:

\- A short newsletter every few days with practical tips, ideas, and help (not preachy)

\- Maybe I could make some mini bite-sized courses as I go (things you can actually use, not influencer BS)

Anyway, I'm super open to feedback on what would be most helpful. I just want to build something that can help people.

I've had a few ideas on what would be most useful.

1. Financial First-Aid: how to stop financial bleeding after a job loss. Stuff like how to cut costs, negotiate bills/mortgage etc, and build a micro-budget to survive.

2. Job Search: how to stand out when 500 people apply. I'm thinking refocusing resume for an AI world, how to network, and scripts you can use. Also, things to get past the ATS black hole.

3. Micro-Income ideas in the Meantime: stuff you can do this week to make a little money. I'm not talking 7-figure business startup BS. Just some practical things that might add up and help you get by.

4. Solo Skills: maybe you can take something you already know and package it into a service for local gigs, tutoring, consulting, etc.

5. AI Basics: not another guru course. Just enough to help you improve a CV, tweak a cover letter, or prep for interviews with AI help without getting flagged by those resume scanners. Also, enough to ensure that you come across as AI proficient for your next role. (Applying it in a real job environment)

6. (Maybe) : something more reflective that helps you figure out what’s next when you can't get a job. Just to keep the momentum and mindset right.

7. And for the sales people (like my son in law): how to do fractional work (That's where you do doing 2–3 part-time roles instead of just one full-time job) In sales, it might mean that you are not on the payroll, but get paid based on performance by multiple companies at once (how to pitch it so it's no risk and no brainer for a company to take you on)

So before I jump in too deep without thinking, I wanted to know if other thought it might be worthwhile, and what would be most helpful right now. (I'm sitting on my hands, have the time, and I have contacts that can probably fund this for me)

Would this help you? What would you actually want in something like this? Are there topics I’m missing?

I really want to help people. Happy to chat in the comments or DM. No sales pitch coming after this. Just trying to do something to help people.

Thanks

PS: I numbered the ideas I came up with so you can just comment with numbers (eg 1,6) if its easier. If you have better ideas I would love to know.

jobs,is a master's degree worth it,Is it worth starting engineering degree studies after a master's in a different field?,"I’m 24 years old and I have completed my master’s degree in a field that doesn’t interest me much, it taught me only soft skills pretty much. I got into a decently paid internship with good prospects as an consultant, but I don’t want to spend the rest of my life in a corporate environment.

The highlight of my student life was the international exchanges I participated in, which helped me grow significantly. I really miss the feeling of continuous development and I don’t want to lose that momentum. I feel a hunger for knowledge, I like challenges, and I simply want to keep wanting to learn.

My studies weren’t demanding, so I studied minimally just to pass. In the meantime, I trained myself in other fields, took courses, etc. It was only towards the end of my studies that I discovered a desire to learn and an interest in more engineering fields like programming, physics, and robotics.

I’m considering starting part-time engineering studies next year to make up for lost time because I feel I have a lot of potential and don’t want to waste it. I somewhat regret my previous choice of studies and think that if I’m going to make any changes, now is the time. I know I would need to refresh my knowledge of mathematics and/or physics since I haven’t had much of it in the past few years. I would also like to participate in another international exchange for a semester or two, if I could do it while working remotely.

My desire have always been to startup and run my own business in the future, I have time and energy but I lack the technical knowledge.

For the record - I live in european country where education is free.

On the other hand, I don’t want to be 30 years old in the future and still not have a clear career path.

Is such a return and starting from scratch a good idea?

jobs,is a master's degree worth it,WHY I QUIT AFTER 1 WEEK ($25 an hour),"I usually like to get laid off because its an internal voice in  my head that tells me I am not a quitter. I am 40+ and have had my fair share of ups and downs in life. I just moved to a new city and needed a job. In the middle of a masters degree and you know how that can be. You do not have the degree but you are educated and employers either want to lowball you or not hire you at all because they think once you do get a degree you will quit or your school work will interfere.

**Here are some red flags of why I RESIGNED 1 WEEK after getting hired:**

* Playing with my money (offer me a position and tell me I have to work up to that)
* Jobs that do not pay overtime (illegal)
* Jobs with Impossible Expectations
* Jobs that expect you to learn on the job without adequate training
* Jobs with no lunch breaks (Texas doesnt require employer to offer breaks no matter the hours)
* Jobs that have Tyrannical supervisors (they tend to be very unhappy and when you bring positive energy they sense it and do everything to lower your vibration to match theirs)

This particular job was in Houston, Texas and I just moved to the city from Miami. Literally my 2nd week here I got a job. Can you imagine how relieved I was! I was absolutely ecstatic when I got hired. The pay was $25 and hour which isnt great but in Houston its definitely good enough to live a somewhat comfortable existence (rent $1000 a month and pay checks are $4400 a month).

Ok the day before I start working they tell me. We will pay you $25 an hour, we just want you to work for $18 an hour during training. I was like ok cool. Training is only for 3 days.

The person that trained me they fired immediately after training me. Then they come back and tell me to work 2 more weeks until I get $25. I resigned the same day. I was willing to do the $18 an hour for a few days but then when they extended it to two weeks, I immediately realized okay, they keep moving the goal post and I am in my 40s. No way are you going to play with me like that.

I should have never accepted the position. I am in this position mostly because I lived out of country for 7 years working remotely in tech. I just got so tired of it (tech is only worth it to me at this point in my life if i own the business). The politics, bs, boredom, and literally staring at my cpu all day in a chair; I been there down that..made money..bought foreign cars...lived a solid life in my 30s because of tech...until one day i woke up and nobody would hire me remotely anymore... its like when covid ended remote tech jobs became a lot more difficult for me to get and I had lost all luster for it.

But it's hard to feel excited because it's such a step down from what I was doing before. After 7 years of corporate, half of which was remote, I'm back to one rung above retail and another paycut to $20/hr. The rate is what I was offered at my dream job 10 years ago, and even at that time they admitted it was low. Now it's ""competitive pay"" in a very HCOL state and area.

I left my masters degree and office jobs off my resume which seemed to help, so I would recommend that to anyone going from white to blue collar. I'm not going to mention it unless they ask. I still want to keep doing freelance and passion projects on the side but the job is full time with a split schedule so I have to work Saturdays more often than not. I'm basically going to be living my grad school schedule as my life and see how long I can grind until I crash out... 

Again, I'm so aware that I'm lucky and I am very grateful. I'm not going to give up applying for a better opportunity somewhere else. But when my friends and family congratulate me I don't feel happy or excited. I signed the paperwork because I need the money, and it felt like I signed my soul away for far less than it's worth. 

If you read this and think I'm whining that's totally fair. I'm just hoping someone can relate and maybe offer up some helpful, positive advice on how to face this new reality of a 50 hr combo ft/freelance work week and not go crazy over the fact my weekend is sliced in half.

jobs,is a master's degree worth it,First real analyst interview ever. Panicking. Anyone down to do a mock or give tips?,"Hi guys,

So backstory, I’m 30 years old and recently graduated late last year with a bachelor’s in data analytics. Since graduating, I’ve been trying to break into the field with no luck. I’ve applied to over 160 jobs just in the past month and only landed 3 phone screens, none of which moved forward.

Recently, my wife saw a job posting at her company that matched my field and forwarded my resume to the manager of that position. She doesn’t know them personally or anything, just figured it was worth a shot. Somehow, that actually led to a phone screen, and now I’ve got a “behavioral and job-specific” interview in just a few days.

I looked up the job, and despite the listing saying there were ""100+"" applicants, I somehow got through the phone screen and scheduled for the interview all in the span of a single day. Sadly, this interview is the closest I’ve ever been to starting a real data career, and I’m both excited and freaking out. I’ve only had two interviews in my life, and both were for warehouse grunt floor job so this is a whole new level.

Ever since I got the interview, I’ve been in full panic study mode. I’ve been spending about 9 hours a day reviewing SQL, Excel, and Power BI, and re-reading the job description like it’s an exam study guide. I’ve been watching YouTube videos on analyst interviews, doing mock interviews with AI, and even trying to cram a bit during work hours at my current job just to get some extra reps in.

Unfortunately, I’m an absolute mess during interviews. I sound like some mix between Donald Trump without the confidence and a sleepy old man trying to tell a long story. I ""um… uh…” like crazy and sometimes I’ll say the same thing three different times in three different ways in case the first two didn’t sound nervous enough.

I’ve also been battling some heavy low confidence & imposter syndrome. My current job doesn’t relate to my degree at all, and I just had a baby in the past year, so I’ve been stretched thin. And when I see “100+ applicants” on the job posting, I just assume everyone else has a master’s, a polished portfolio, and actual analyst experience. The most I been doing at my job is visualizations but it's not like that's finding insights or anything. To add salt to the wound I'm already located in the Silicon Valley so that just about gives you an idea of the people I'm trying to compete against. I feel like I'm completely cooked.

Honestly, I already feel embarrassed that the dashboard I listed on my resume was just a solo school project. Not even a capstone, just a basic class assignment. It’s all I’ve got, and I’m pretty sure it screams rookie.

I really want this job, not just for the title or the role, but because it would be lifechanging. I’ve spent most of my adult life making garbage pay and quietly battling depression, wondering if I’d ever get out of it. Going back to school was a huge risk, and this would be the first sign that it wasn’t all for nothing. The job pays around $69K, and while I know that’s low for a lot of people here, but it would completely change my and my family’s life. I know some of you make $120K+ and beyond, but for me, this is my shot at actual stability and finally getting into the field.

If anyone has tips for behavioral or technical interviews (especially for analyst roles), what kinds of questions to expect, or would even be willing to mock interview me, it’d mean the world.

Thank you. I’m doing my best, but nerves are absolutely winning right now. I’m trying to expect the worst but hope for the best. I know putting all my eggs in one basket for a single interview is a terrible idea and probably even worse for my nerves, but it’s hard not to. It’s hard to believe this ISN'T my one shot, because it really is.

tldr; late grad trying to break into data analytics after 160+ rejections. Got a surprise interview thanks to wife. I’ve been cramming like crazy but struggling with nerves, imposter syndrome, and interview anxiety. This job would be life-changing for me and my family. Would love any advice or mock interview help.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1m3yx6s/first_real_analyst_interview_ever_panicking/,1752938733.0,white-christmas,1m3yx6s,advice_seeking
jobs,is a master's degree worth it,Help Wanted,"This past February, I left my teaching job for a job in a completely different field. I’m currently working in customer service for a tech company. I left teaching because of the pay and struggling with classroom behaviors. I felt that everything I had to deal with wasn’t worth the pay. 

Teaching is my passion and what I got my Masters degree in. Even when I struggled with it, I was still passionate about the job. I was really good at it and my students loved me. I just couldn’t see making a life in this current economy and world with the shitty pay. I needed something that would offer me financial growth. 

So, my friend at this same company referred me and I was hired! Starting pay was more than what I was making teaching and opportunity for raises and promotions. It’s also a WFH job and quite relaxed. Most days are easy and time flies by on the job. I also have unlimited PTO. However, I feel severely mentally under stimulated and indifferent towards this job. I have little motivation and try hard to push past that to be good and productive. Which I am! But it doesn’t feel rewarding at all right now. 

I’ve been missing my teaching job and the students. A lot. I’ve been looking at job openings in my county and there’s one at a really good high school and it also offers teaching creative writing! I’m so tempted to apply. But I would be right back where I was financially. I don’t know what to do. I’ve been feeling really depressed but I am not even sure if my job is the root of it. I just miss teaching a lot. What should I do?

P.s. I would feel really embarrassed to quit my current job to go back to teaching and feel like I can’t make up my mind. Idk. Feeling some shame too.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1mhm7gd/help_wanted/,1754333593.0,Severe-Design5492,1mhm7gd,advice_seeking
jobs,is a master's degree worth it,Title: [Career Crossroads] 21M English Grad with TOI SAP Internship – MJMC vs MBA vs Upskill?,"I’m a 21-year-old English Literature graduate currently interning at Times of India, a newspaper company (Booking Intern, working on SAP). While I enjoy being in a media giant, my role is technical, and I’m confused about my future:  

1. Stay in Media/Tech?
   - Is mastering SAP worth it long-term? What certifications (SAP FICO/MM) complement my English background?  
   - Would a Masters in Journalism & Mass Communication (MJMC) help grow within TOI/newspaper roles? Or is it redundant since I’m already here?  

2. MBA Route?  
   - Better ROI than MJMC? Should I target media management programs or general MBA?  

3. Government Exams?
   - Given TOI’s brand value, should I still consider UPSC (English optional)/SSC CGL for stability?  

4. Alternative Paths?
   - Digital marketing, content strategy, or pivoting to IT via **data journalism** courses?  

My Profile:
- Skills: SAP (basic), Canva, debate/public speaking  
- Interests: Media ecosystem but need financial security  

Need Honest Takes:
- If you’ve worked in Indian media/IT: What’s the growth path for someone in my position?  
- MJMC graduates: Did the degree open doors, or is experience king?  
- SAP professionals: Can I survive without an engineering degree?

jobs,quit job to start business,I quit my job without another lined up due to mental health,"As the title says, I quit my $100k+ a year project manager job two weeks ago today that I started 2 months ago. ... I got done a decent comfortable gig making $65k a year for this one because lack of growth. I chased the dollar and regretted it. This new job had a massive amount of project issues left by my predecessors (4 in counting within a year of my hire). 

The 2 months I was here could easily he classified as the worst my mental health has been pushed. Each day was a 10 hour+ day with multiple panic attacks a week. I spent all my time fixing issues and being unable to actually learn the business and other areas needed. Instantly was held at this standard of ""you should know how to fix these issues."" I could go on and on, but it was miserable.

I'm posting this as I've never quit a job without another lined up, but I was in a dark place mentally and still am. Before taking this job I was even struggling some, this just pushed me over the edge. I am taking some time to work on myself, get help, and get caught up at home on projects.

I am looking for any advice on how to get back on track. I have the potential to get my old job back (awaiting updates) and some potential contract work. I have a large nest egg saved up, so I'm not super worried financially for a few months. I hate the idea of having a gap on my resume, but this job was killing me. 

Every day I feel regret but my gut says it was the right choice.....

UPDATE: 12/10/2024

Thank you all for the kind words and support. I have taken the majority of advice given and started a log of what to look out for in my job search. Additionally, I am seeking some counseling to get better help around my mental health. Some of the hardest parts of this is the ""not knowing"", as days progress. Right now, I am sitting here continously applying for jobs with the feeling of no success.  

Final Update: 1/18/2025

I spent the last two months applying to 200+ jobs, 4 hours of searching, and utilizing my network a day. I just got two jobs offers: $75,000 (local to me) and $85,000 (1.5 hours round trip). I ended up taking the lesser pay as it follows my career path better. In this job market, I'm extremely happy I landed anything, and the time off since November 26th has been well spent. I start in the next few weeks and will be seeing a therapist and getting some assistance with medication. I have been working out every other day for a month while dieting and spending more time with family. I appreciate everyone's support and helpful insights as I've navigated this dark path. If anyone ever needs some help or assistance please reach out. I'm happy to share my strategy and how I made it through!

Pay is base 2500 at 5 sales, I was able to make that but I didn’t sell any more then that. I was pressured in to working 9 hours 6 days a week, based on the day I started (10th of june) I am ending up getting paid less then minimum wage where i live. I have taken 4 hours of those numbers above but that is much. I also have ended up working more the 9 almost every day by about a half hour.

The owner is facing bankruptcy but he’s out golfing and having fun more than he’s here. I am not completely sure he’ll be able to pay be next month unless I am able to sell a lot more cars (Im not an amazing salesperson).

jobs,quit job to start business,Fired by a regular employee? 😂,"So let me preface this by stating this is a NEW restaurant/butcher place where I live. (There’s no structure what so ever). 

EVERYTHING started Saturday the 17th. Our main ‘manager’ left Thursday quitting so the owners brother was filling in to help out acting as manager we’ll call him Daryl. With the place being new and all that nothing everything runs smoothly people have questions yadda yadda. Well, Friday I had messaged about my pay because I was told BY THE OWNER I was making $12 (I live in income based housing so I NEED to know what I’m making when I get a different job) and my paystub was for $10.45 an hour I asked the person if I (emphasis on I) could call them to speak about it. They needed up calling me and I asked Daryl if I could take it as we weren’t busy, THATS when his issues with me started. Anyway Saturday rolls around, I had a question about if dine in guests getting stuff from the hot case if it’s the same price as what we sell to take out guests or if it was different but with tax. 

I walked to the back to ask said question, I wasn’t even back there for like 30 seconds before realizing he was on the phone. Which I get you’re busy. BUT instead of saying give me a few minutes I’m on the phone or just putting his finger up to signal he’s busy he FLIPPED out on me, “if you bother me one more time we’re spitting ways message or call so and so I know you texted her yesterday to have her call you, I’m not stupid don’t bother me again”. 
Again. I understand he was on the phone and I wouldn’t have even walked back. That next day the schedule came out and EVERY SINGLE day last week was labeled “OFF”. 

I talked to someone who was under Daryl and had a conversation with her, and was put back on the schedule for THIS week. And then the screenshots are from today/yesterday Tuesday the 27th the purple messages are from a REGULAR employee. And the green messages are from the new “manager”. 

Basically, how fucked is this and what do I do? 

Long story short. A regular employee fired me, because the owners brother didn’t want me working there. ",1382,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1f33ah8,1724826364.0,Embarrassed_Hour_578,1f33ah8,advice_seeking
jobs,quit job to start business,Advice on whether / how to quit my job?,"The situation is:

I work at a fast food pizza place. The job is not a great fit for me in general, but it's *fine,* except that the AGM absolutely drives me insane. She nitpicks literally everything I do (even in front of the customers), is never consistent in her demands, and even though everyone hates her there, I believe she has something against me personally. She's filling the place with nepo hires and probably trying to squeeze the rest of us out. I CANNOT work with her. This Friday I need to work with her for 8 hours and I'm seriously not sure I can do this.

My sibling works at a different pizza place that's much more aligned with my personality, and I really want to pivot there, but they are going to be too busy this week due to a local event to consider hiring anyone. I think I have a good chance after.

I'm torn between some options:

1) Stay there until the other place is less busy so I can apply, and apply elsewhere if needed, don't quit until I get the offer, and risk an honest to god mental breakdown in the meantime

2) Same except put in two weeks' notice now and just do the applications during that time

3) Tell them something came up and I need to quit, without notice, before Friday happens; use the extra time to focus on myself

4) Try Friday with the intention I will just clock out and leave if (when) I'm (inevitably) treated like shit and not care if they fire me for it

My hopeful career path is as an artist, doing commissions and conventions primarily. I'm already doing pretty well at this but it's too early to feel secure in quitting a day job entirely. I have a couple cons coming up and zero energy to prepare for them, so quitting without notice sounds awesome but I don't want to fuck myself or my non-AGM coworkers over either lol.

It's at will employment and I've been actively working there only ~3 months (started in February, but took time off to care for a loved one for 3 months) if that matters.

What would you recommend?? Or is there something better I didn't think of?? Thank you.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1mdnjbt/advice_on_whether_how_to_quit_my_job/,1753922440.0,-Klippy,1mdnjbt,advice_seeking
jobs,quit job to start business,Need honest advice - Am I making a mistake by wanting to quit my job to work with my dad full-time,"Hi everyone. I’m 24M, based in India and I’ve been in marketing for a little over a year now (content creation + social media + event management). When I started out, I was interning for ₹7,000/month. Fast forward to now: I’m working a full-time job in an F&B startup earning close to ₹50,000/month. The growth has been insane, considering the fact that I only have 1 year of work experience. I’ve also been building content on the side (which is growing nicely), and I recently joined a new job at the end of May. So it’s been about two months.

Now, here’s where it gets tricky.

The job itself is actually pretty decent. The founders are understanding, the environment is chill, the hours are flexible - I come in early and leave early, so I have time to work on my content or hit the gym. It’s exhausting but manageable. Still, these past 2–3 days I’ve hit a serious wall. Burnout. Zero motivation. And I don’t even know why!

Yes, the workload is a lot for one person. There’s a lot of spoon-feeding going on which feels frustrating. I’ve always kept my ego aside at work, but lately, I’m starting to feel like I’m pouring way too much of myself into something that doesn’t fully value it. I’m starting to ask: what if I put this energy somewhere else?

That “somewhere else” is my family business.

Yes, I have a family business and I know I’m lucky to even have that option. A lot of people around me keep saying I should go work with my dad. Financially, it could be more rewarding. There’s security, freedom, and in the long run, ownership. And to be honest, I’ve spoken to my dad recently and told him I want to take his business seriously. The conversation went well. He’s open to it.

But here’s the issue: I’m a creative person. I love building things, experimenting with ideas, creating content. That’s why I chose marketing. My dad’s business is... kind of boring. It’s repetitive, with very little creative scope. I’ve visited his office multiple times, but he never really had time to teach me properly. So I kept drifting back to agency jobs.

That said, I’m reaching a point where I’m thinking long term. In 5–10 years, I don’t want to be working under someone. I want to build something of my own. And to do that, I feel like I need to make the tough call now - take a step back from agency life and start learning and building within the family business.

Currently, I work Monday to Friday and travel a lot. I get back home around the same time my dad does, so I can’t go to his office regularly. The only window I have is Saturdays, where I don’t have fixed work - I’ve decided I’ll go every Saturday and learn. That feels like the only realistic middle ground for now.

But the truth is: I feel lost.

I don’t know if I’m making a mistake. I don’t hate my job. It’s just that I’m tired of giving 110% and constantly feeling like it’s never enough. There’s a lot of expectation and very little appreciation. And even though the pay is decent, I feel like I’m worth more! Not just in money, but in ownership and satisfaction.

So my question to you all is:

Should I quit and start working with my dad full-time? Or should I give this job a little more time, considering it’s only been two months and leaving now might come off too abrupt?

Would love to hear what you think. If you’ve been in a similar spot, or have any perspective on family business vs creative work, please drop your thoughts. Thanks for reading!

careerguidance,passed over for promotion,Massive rug pull... Passed over for promotion after months of high praise while filling my managers role. Can I convey how disrespected I feel?,"Hi - I've been at my company for 7 years, and have been on my team for about 3. I'm essentially an area account/project manager for a commercial division at a contracting/remodeling company. Since my manager left three months ago, I have been covering their position and have been essentially the sole resource for new upper management regarding my team. In that time, I've been assigned responsibilities that are far above my typical duties, including all of my manager's duties, but with less resources. I've been managed at the director level, and have been assigned projects that would typically have been even above my former manager's duties by the VP of Sales and the President of my division. Through all of this, I've been told I am doing an amazing job, far exceeding expectations, and that they ""want to invest in me"". 

Anyway, they finally opened a rec for my manager's old position, under a new title as they're shaking things up in the division, but generally the same responsibilities. This position pays nearly $30k more than my current salary of $60k, with a higher bonus payout as well. 

So, as the title states... I didn't get the position. It was given to an outside candidate who is an industry veteran or something of the sort. They have no notes for me, they tell me they were extremely impressed with my interview, but I just don't have the tenured experience of the other candidate.  They've offered me a consolation role with a ""senior"" next to my manager title and will likely take on some of the responsibilities listed in the job I was just passed over for...for a $5K raise... I know I'm getting absolutely screwed here, I'm already looking for a new job. 

My questions: I have a meeting with my current manager this week to discuss defining the new ""senior"" role. I'd like to ask them to re-evaluate the compensation or keep the scope of the role limited to essentially title only. How do I approach this conversation tactfully? Am I supposed to pretend like this isn't a massive rug pull compared to what I was working towards? Is it possible or even worth trying to convey how disrespected I feel?",313,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1ksidal/massive_rug_pull_passed_over_for_promotion_after/,1747889182.0,Captainx11,1ksidal,advice_seeking
careerguidance,passed over for promotion,Passed over for promotion but asked to stay. What do I ask for? Or do I move on?,"I was a part of early days of a tech start up. I am Associate Vice President of my line of business (LOB) on the Operations side. My LOB is a new concept in the field, our competitors have tried to figure it out, but we are years ahead. Our company sold nearly two years ago to a much larger corporation, we are just a portion of their portfolio, and were mostly left alone to operate. 

We acquired another company one year ago. There is now a whole other LOB that expands the services in the division I am in, but my LOB is 90% of our division's revenue, additionally, I have the highest EBITDA. My COO was clear during the merging phase I should be promoted to VP of both LOBs, but as a part of the sale and a re-cap, the old C-suite was being phased out. At the time, I met with President of the Corporation, who knew the growth I wanted, that based on my revenue and staffing, I wanted VP. They were very encouraging and said to be patient, but that I am valuable and it will happen. 

Well, with the COO out, they promoted someone to SVP who owned Ops and Technology. I was excited. The SVP is very well respected in the industry. Total bad ass, and I saw it as an opportunity for mentorship. Within a couple of weeks, SVP was hyping me up, and saying I should be VP of both LOBs, that I was their ""successor"". This went on for a few months, then the SVP told two directors under me that I was going places in the corporation, going to be promoted, and that it would mean there is an opportunity for one of them to grow into my spot. The SVP encouraged those two specially to step it up because it was going to happen soon, and that there are two managers on the team, which had potential to grow into the open director spot.  

Cut to 5/20. SVP told me that they hired a new VP of Operations that I would report to starting 5/27, and SVP would be going back to just Technology. I was flabbergasted. What the heck happened? I was told my LOB was ""too important"" and the other LOB required too much work and they couldn't risk my revenue; and that I did not have a successor yet on my team as neither of the two initially tapped directors had stepped up enough.

The last month has been rough. SVP has told me conflicting stories. I don't know who to trust. Two weeks ago, we had a big internal onsite meeting, SVP was there, new VP, and President. I tried my best. The other LOB owner barely participated, normally I try to help, but not this time, I am not doing the job for the new VP, who also barely participated. At some point, a friend from another area met the President for drinks and they asked how things are going, friend had a little buzz and said, ""Well, you heard OP is going to quit?""

I got a request the following morning to carve out time that day to speak to the President. I have known President for almost 10 years. The President was distressed that I was considering leaving. According to them, the SVP was not the advocate I thought they were. I genuinely don't know who to trust. President was very impressed with my performance at the onsite, I pitched a program that would be a game-changer operationally. I also met with a client and detailed out another solution we could turn into a revenue stream that they were excited about. 

The President said I should be coming to client meetings and coming up with new business solutions. They want me to keep my LOB, because it is too valuable, but maybe I could review acquisitions proposals to help us grow. They kept repeating they don't want to lose me. They said we should look at my compensation. 

I explained that word is out in the industry about the changes in leadership, it's very well known that I built the LOB. I was direct that I am being approached. I have already turned down one offer, but I am answering the phone when I previously wouldn't. 

I also said that I don't want to leave. I have built this team and LOB from scratch. We were both off work this week. The President asked to meet next week, and I am supposed to come up with a plan for what I want to stay. They said to forget the noise of who said what, focus on what I want, can it be at this corporation, and if it is, how do we make it happen.

The new VP does not know my LOB. I don't want that other LOB anymore. I want to do new business solutioning and keep my current team/LOB. I want to hear issues in the industry and figure out how to operationalize completely new solutions. 

A close friend and mentor said to ask for a retention bonus. Do I ask for a retention bonus and salary increase? Or one or the other? Should I stand firm that I want a VP title? VP of Operations Development? I don't want to over-play my hand. I know VP jobs are not easy to come by, so I need to be strategic. Or am I done at this corporation and start my exit strategy?

Would consider myself a high performer, had glowing reviews from my managers and I’m well-liked in the team. We work really well together and I genuinely like my job. Senior management have also acknowledged I’m capable of handling work above my pay grade and repeatedly mentioned I will be up for promotion soon. 

A month ago, we had a new guy transfer in from a different team with 0 relevant experience. If I’m being honest, his work and behaviour is rather atrocious. He’s rude, vulgar, constantly deflecting work, mostly MIA and extremely loud, to the point we have gotten complaints from other departments about him. He’s also under HR investigation for unprofessional behaviour in his previous team - threatening violence and inappropriate language. 

A promotion role has just opened up and my colleagues were very excited and encouraged me to apply. My managers also mentioned they recommended me for the role and were looking forward to me taking on more responsibilities. In a sharp turn of events, the senior manager organized a meeting today and announced the promotion role will be given to the new guy (he wasn’t present in the meeting). My colleagues were visibly upset and many expressed that he was clearly unfit and underperforming less than a month in. Senior manager shrugged and said somebody higher up said he’s good and she decided to just give him the role without thinking much. 

I’m still in shock, speechless and unsure how to react. Maybe a little angry and feeling under-appreciated too? Today I was just in a daze and couldn’t really concentrate at work. How do you get over something like that?

careerguidance,passed over for promotion,Got passed over for a promotion I was promised — how do you stay motivated when you feel stuck and undervalued?,"One year ago, during our team evaluation, all promotions were put on hold because our department didn’t meet its quota. Even so, my manager personally promised me that I’d be promoted once things improved. I understood, kept my head down, and stayed focused—completing tasks on time, going beyond my role as a graphic designer, and doing my best every day.

Fast forward to this year’s evaluation: I didn’t get the promotion. Instead, his boss told him he needed to delegate more because he was too hands-on. As a result, he promoted someone from my team to Marketing Manager—and she’s now my manager.

To make things harder, he also promoted two people who submitted their resignations last year. Meanwhile, I stayed loyal, took on extra responsibilities, and didn’t complain.

What’s even more frustrating is that my manager is actually a nice person. But I can’t bring myself to open up to him about how I feel, because I know it’ll just sound like I’m venting or being emotional—and I’m pretty sure he’d take it negatively. So I’m just keeping everything to myself and trying to stay professional.

I know promotions aren’t everything, but I really feel undervalued.

Has anyone else gone through something like this? How did you handle it without burning bridges or losing motivation?

careerguidance,passed over for promotion,Felt Betrayed After Being Passed Over for Promotion — Now I’m Unsure What to Do Next ?,"Hi everyone,

I’m in my early 20s and currently living in British Columbia. I recently left a job with a major package delivery company after being promised a promotion that never came. I worked there for over two years, gave my best daily, and even balanced part-time work in the security industry during that time. I was reliable, hardworking, and always took initiative.

My supervisor repeatedly told me I was doing great and assured me that I’d be considered for a leadership position when it opened. When it did, I was told I’d be interviewed, but they ended up hiring someone else — someone known for doing the bare minimum but who had personal ties to upper management.

When I asked why, my supervisor said: “I can promote anyone I want.” That hit me hard, especially coming from someone who promised fairness. They asked me to wait for more openings in a few months, but I couldn’t stay in an environment that didn’t value integrity or merit. So I resigned.

Now, I’m still working part-time in security — I’ve even taken on some leadership responsibilities there — but I’m unsure where to go from here. I also have experience in logistics and customer service. I’ve thought about going into trades, digital marketing, or applying for government or union roles. I want something stable, growth-oriented, and meaningful. But I’m confused and afraid of wasting more time on the wrong path.

If anyone’s been through something similar — how did you rebuild from that kind of disappointment? How do you choose your next direction when you know you want better but aren’t sure how to start?

Thanks in advance for your time and advice. I’m ready to move forward — just need help figuring out the right way.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1la746c/felt_betrayed_after_being_passed_over_for/,1749789106.0,egoisticchill,1la746c,advice_seeking

careerguidance,passed over for promotion,Is it crazy to turn down a job offer paying $40K more?,"I currently earn $143K per year, and a 15 percent bonus. My company is great. The people are kind to work with, we constantly get taken out for lunch/dinner, and they are always super flexible. The company has offices in different countries, and they have let me visit those offices and paid for beautiful hotels and it's just been fun. They require me to be in the office 3 days a week. Raises every year are about 2-3 percent. Managers are understanding and flexible. I was recently passed over for a promotion, although my boss insists that I am not far away from it, but no timing on when it can happen. The people working at this company are my entire social network, and we hang out frequently.  

I just got offered a job for $180,000 plus 15 percent bonus. I use to work at the company that made me the offer, and I left them 4 years ago because the pay was atrocious (i made $75K per year at the time), and there wasn't really much opportunity for advancement or promotion. They just offered me a more prestigious role than I currently have. The downside is I know they are very stingy with pay raises (most years they literally don't give a single percent). The company is cheap, so almost never any lunches, or happy hours, and the people are more conservative and rigid. They require employees to be in the office 4 days a week, and rumors are they might do 5. People who don't meet the requirement are disicplined. The job title in this position is prestigious, and would look better on my resume. It might open up some doors for me in my job market compared to my current role given the job duties are more expansive.

My commute to the office is an hour each way, so 4 days a week in the office seems rough. 

I live in NYC, so taxes are high. After deductions for health insurance, my current takehome bi-weekly pay is $3,450. In the new role, I calculate my bi-weekly pay will be around $4,200.

My situation:

	•	I work in a smaller but growing market in an increasingly profitable tech company (operational role), where I’ve built a team of four over the past year, trained them, and set up tools and processes. However, this isn’t seen as a “level-up worthy” achievement because other countries already operate at a more advanced level.

	•	My direct manager’s team was recently let go, and the team was dismantled across other teams. My new manager (their former manager) doesn’t really care about what I do, since my work only marginally impacts their KPIs.

	•	The country leads won’t support my promotion—likely because their own reports (who are my peers) aren’t ready for one yet.

	•	The only senior leader who seems to genuinely care about my growth is the director of the country leads, but I can’t report to them due to headcount allocation.

	•	I’m already doing the work of a team lead, but I keep getting told my team’s “impact isn’t there yet.” Meanwhile, my former peers—who were simply given teams instead of having to build them—were promoted last cycle.

I’ve already tried making my work more visible, tying it to bigger business goals, and securing sponsorship, but none of it has worked so far. I don’t currently have an internal or external move lined up, and the structural issue in my reporting line will persist for another six months at least.

careerguidance,workplace discrimination,Do you need a tool to help you document your workplace discrimination?,"Hey everyone.

A few years ago, I faced workplace discrimination that led to retaliation and ultimately, my termination. I had a solid case, but without enough documented evidence, it was shelved by the EEOC. The experience destroyed me mentally. I battled countless nights of anger, depression, and the weight of being unable to provide for my wife and daughter.

I realized that so many others go through the same thing, struggling to prove their cases because they didn’t have a clear, organized way to track what’s happening. That’s why I built hive-ly, a free tool that helps employees securely log incidents, organize evidence, and get connected to legal help when needed. I built AI inside of it so you can ask it questions that may be helpful to understanding your particular situation.

I just want to get this in front of people who might need it. If you’ve ever dealt with workplace discrimination or retaliation, how did you document your case? What do you wish you had at the time?

careerguidance,workplace discrimination,How do I let my boss know I am resigning due to a toxic workplace? ,"Hi everyone, bit of a predicament. 

Last Friday, I had a difficult conversation with my manager about a disciplinary issue involving me in the office. For some time, I’d been dealing with an employee (c-suite level, but works alongside me) who was responsible for significant tasks but often avoided the work, pushing it onto me instead. Unfortunately, it went further—there were troubling signs that this employee had been mismanaging resources, possibly even embezzling funds (of a few crores). They wanted me to work under them and keep my mouth shut, but I raised it on email and asked them to not bother with my responsibilities. This exchange eventually landed in the CEO’s inbox, who then passed it along to my manager. Thankfully, my manager was supportive, offering advice on handling situations like this more strategically in the future.

However, this incident was only the tip of the iceberg. My manager doesn’t work directly in my office, so he’s not fully aware of the daily dynamics here. This employee’s behavior goes beyond avoiding work; there’s a strong undertone of discrimination, especially against women. He has openly made comments like, “I don’t want women in this office” and has specifically blocked female candidates from being hired under various pretexts (the recruiters will support if I ask them for evidence) His influence is significant in the office, and despite multiple complaints and instances of biased behavior, leadership has taken no action, possibly due to his seniority and age. 

The overall environment has only added to the discomfort. It’s not uncommon to witness verbal clashes among leadership, complete with shouting and cursing.

I had already drafted a resignation letter, but Friday’s events solidified my resolve. Saturday, I recently received an offer from another organization with a 30% salary increase. It’s an opportunity for a fresh start in a (hopefully) healthier work environment.

Now, I’m preparing to hand in my resignation, feeling both determined and apprehensive about facing the CEO, the leadership,aand the problem employee

1.) It's wfo day tomorrow. How do I go in and adress this person, if at all? 
2.)I enjoyed working with my boss, but this office is not it for me. How do I part way without any issues? 

TL;DR
An employee at my current workplace has been avoiding responsibilities, passing tasks onto me, and displaying discriminatory behavior, particularly against women. Leadership is aware but won’t act due to the employee’s age. A disciplinary incident last Friday reaffirmed my concerns, and Saturday since accepted an offer with a 30% salary increase. I’m planning to resign but feel uneasy about facing the leadership and this employee in person tomorrow.",26,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1go2yig/how_do_i_let_my_boss_know_i_am_resigning_due_to_a/,1731252086.0,AgileSuccess7584,1go2yig,advice_seeking

careerguidance,workplace discrimination,Considering telling a manager that I now don’t want her to write me a reference letter anymore- opinions?,"Hi, I’m 24F law student. I recently finished volunteering at a not-for-profit legal referral service which targets individuals living with disabilities. 

Recently, I asked my manager for a reference letter for articling and we met up to discuss it. Throughout our conversation, she heavily implied that I had autism (nothing is wrong with having autism, I just don’t have it - I have epilepsy). 

She also said that multiple of my colleagues made complaints about me and that she didn’t bring them up with me because she knew I had a disability. This was the first I had ever heard about such complaints and I did not ask for any specifics. No one ever came to me about them (colleagues or the supervisor) throughout the year so this came up out of the blue. Honestly, I feel as though these might have been made up. I also feel discriminated against because she specifically didn’t tell me about these complaints because of my disability. My epilepsy does not impact my behaviour so I’m very confused about that remark and hurt by it. 

She also said that she wasn’t sure if I liked the program despite my offering to do extra shifts throughout the summer and into next year without prompting. 

Throughout the program, the supervisor ultimately didn’t offer any corrections/suggestions on what she wanted us to improve and she constantly micromanaged us. I’m talking checking all of our draft emails and rewriting them without any comment on how to improve. 

 Despite all of her remarks, she ultimately told me she’d write me a reference letter. I don’t exactly feel comfortable with accepting the reference letter and I want to end this work relationship and tell her about what she said to me and its impacts. I have decided to reach out to the volunteer coordinator about further training for partner organizations in general.

careerguidance,workplace discrimination,What should my mom expect from a workplace harassment investigation in Canada?,"
Hi everyone,

I’m looking for advice on behalf of my mom, who’s going through a really difficult situation at work. She recently filed a formal workplace harassment complaint after experiencing what she believes is discrimination related to her pregnancy.

Her doctor recommended that, due to pain and complications, she avoid long commutes and instead work from home 1–2 days a week—a request that’s entirely feasible for her role. When she brought this up to the HR coordinator, he responded in a condescending tone declining her request entirely, saying things like “you don’t really do anything anyway” and that her job “isn’t important.” He also told her that when she returns from maternity leave, there may not be work for her, and that someone else will likely be taking over her responsibilities along with other tasks.

She found this really upsetting and degrading—especially since, in Canada, it’s illegal to eliminate someone’s position or penalize them because of pregnancy or maternity leave. Because of this, she filed an internal harassment complaint, and the HR manager disregarded it and basically said she is over reacting. She then submitted a formal complaint to the provincial workplace board.

This manager has apparently had multiple complaints made against him in the past, which makes the situation feel even more discouraging. In this situation, the latest update is a mediator has been hired and is conducting interviews. 

Has anyone been through something similar? I’m really worried for her as this is a rough situation, and she really does love her job. She is good at it and enjoys the environment before this all happened.

careerguidance,workplace discrimination,Would you consider joining a company that openly indicated bias towards a specific age group during your interview?,"I had a job  interview today with a company that, on it's website  clearly states it champions inclusivity, diversity and supports. 

 However part way through the introduction that the hiring manager made he specified that for the role, he was really focusing on and wanting people in their 30s and early 40s because they would be more willing to want to develop their careers and strive to go further.  He also went on to say that there are ""some people in their 50's working here ""  but the environment is mainly 20s to early 40s.  Very specific comments about age.

Now, I am 50 and look alot younger than my age (due to mum and dad's genes)  and easily pass for early 30s so not sure whether he felt comfortable saying what he did.   I didn't respond to his comments but on hearing them was quite shocked by his openness on it from the outset.  I stopped myself from saying, ""well actually that's age discrimination, assuming that all people in their thirtys etc are go-getters and everyone in their mid 50s and 60s are not interested in furthering their careers.  I'm 50 so is I don't qualify then.""  I continued to be positive and gave nothing away in agreeing or disagreeing with his statements.

The interviewer mentioned it again a bit later and said he'd be making a decision in a few days.  I mentioned that I thought there'd be a second  interview (as I was told by the recuitment agency) but he responded saying maybe but he was very pleased with mine and had no doubts I'd fit into the team, environment etc.

Should I have said something? I'm now disappointed in myself for not raising it to hear the response.  At the same time feeling that if I did, then I would have to reveal my age which would go against me as it's likely I wpuld be discriminated against.  If I were not to reveal it and I was offered the job, when people inevitably find out I could be treated or looked upon unfavourably for hiding it and be seen as not one of the ""hard working younger achievers.""

careerguidance,workplace discrimination,Best option to challenge bank for unfair dismissal?,"Hi all, I was recently made redundant from my job in the UK, and I have serious concerns about the fairness of the process. I would really appreciate any advice on my legal options.

For context, I am a minority female in a male-dominated industry, which I believe may have influenced how my redundancy was handled.

Key concerns:

	•	Potential gender & health discrimination: I performed at the same level as a male colleague, but he received huge bonus while I got 0, with the explanation of “overall desk performance.” I also recently sought occupational health support due to workplace stress, and shortly after that, I was made redundant.
	•	Unfair redundancy process: My team posted job openings for a nearly identical role but did not offer me the chance to transition. When I asked, they said the role required a “different skill set,” yet a male colleague with no prior experience was given the opportunity to be trained for that additional skill set required.
	•	Severance pay concerns: After four years of service, I received less than one month’s pay as redundancy, while I know others got 2-4 weeks per year of service. HR refuses to disclose their calculation method, stating it is “confidential.”
	•	Immediate loss of access & internal job search limitations: My email and internal network access were cut off right away, limiting my ability to explore internal roles. I was also denied entry to a company networking event, despite still being in my consultation period.

I have contacted ACAS and they confirmed with me I could potentially proceed with four claims: unfair dismissal, redundancy pay, qual pay, potential sex discrimination 

I would like to understand:

	1. Do I have legal grounds to challenge my redundancy pay, given that others received more favorable terms?

       2. Do I have legal grounds to challenge this redundancy on the basis of unfair dismissal or discrimination (gender, race, or health-related)?

       3. Given the firm has strong legal team and deeper wallets to drag on in the case of suits, what’s the best legal options here? No win no fee lawyers? Would they potentially be less capable?

I work for a company with a large office in a town a couple towns away from me. We have an office where I live where I work with my supervisor. It is just me (21F) and her (50F). I was hired back in November 2024 as an assistant to her. Everything went fine for the first month or two before I noticed issues. However, I realized really quickly that my day and mood depended on how she was feeling or how her meetings with clients went. I’ve been documenting things since the beginning of this year because I want people in my company to know (when I do leave) that this has been happening. I should also preface before I get into it that I have talked to a higher up at this company about all of this. I was told to go to them when I started because I was warned by multiple people that I would have a very difficult time working with her (at one point I was straight up told that I was hired because my supervisor thought she could push me around easier). I was told by that higher up that they would tell our boss and get back to me within the week but its been a couple of months and I haven’t heard anything.

When I would answer the question wrong on the phone, i would be waived at and looked at like I had made a crazy misstep. I would then be told that I had “fucked up” and that I wasnt ready for that. This happened multiple times over my first few months and still happens to this day if I haven’t been properly prepped. 

Going off of that, asking questions in general has been highly discouraged. It's either that she’s too busy or just doesn’t feel like it. I’ve tried asking other people in our big office but I’m then told how “stupid” or “dense” those people are and that I shouldn’t be asking them anything. She’s called women at the firm “c**ts” when they do something she doesn’t like.

This hasn’t happened as much recently but when I was a couple months in, she found out she had kids my age. She kind of latched onto that and made sure to either tell every client that I was “ so young” and “hired cause I was tech savvy OR use it as an excuse as to why I wasn’t understanding things I had never been shown how to do/trained on. She would often say “I should have known you would mess that up” and things to the same vein. She at one point straight up said “you’re not allowed to forget things. I am. It’s called ageism.”

Today, I walked into work after an accidental 4 day weekend. I got sick on friday and called in (mind you, this is the ONLY TIME I have called in sick) and had taken monday off months ago to see my sibling. I was then met with “I was really pissed you called in. It really fucked me over…it messed up my vacation.” She didn’t have a vacation that was ruined. She had a hard week and didn’t want to come in. I physically could not come in (I have a chronic disorder that leaves me incapacitated for hours when it flares up) and tried my best to give her some notice. This really left me feeling helpless about this whole situation.

I NEED to leave this job. I cannot do it anymore and the things listed above are the tip of the iceberg. She has made incredibly racist remarks about clients and walk-ins to our office, made me bend over in front of a mirror when she thought my shirt cut too low, blamed client complaints against her on the current political environment, and so much more. 

I would really love some advice on how to get out of here. If anyone has dealt with a similar situation please let me know. I feel so trapped because if I complain, she’s the only other one I work closely with. I would be afraid to get retaliated against.

P.S. if anyone knows of any remote jobs in the PNW area that would be really great. I have a Bachelor’s degree in Psych with a specialization in Law.

Just like the title emplies How can I ask for a raise if I have been paid 30k under market average. Long story short, I work in It and was told by my current manager to get 6 certifications in 6 months that would lead to a better pay and a new title. Six months later when I meet the end of the deal he told me he didn't actually expect me to complete them and that's pretty much it. After a few days later, he passed my desk and just told me the compesation was in the works with no timeline. He even told me not to ask as he didn't know when I would get the raise or the role. Being a crucial part of a small IT department consisting of 4 people and being me who manages mostly everything I don't want to barge in and demand a raise as I like working here it just that I cannot keep making 30k less especially when he was the one that brought up the new pay and title.

careerguidance,ask for a raise,Why Is Asking for a Raise Still So Awkward?,"I’ve always wondered why asking for a raise feels so uncomfortable. It’s not like we’re asking for something outrageous—we’re just trying to get fairly paid for the value we bring to the table. But somehow, it still feels like walking into the principal’s office.

I’ve talked to friends who’ve gotten everything from blank stares to passive-aggressive comments when they’ve brought up raises. One even got told, “We don’t do that here.” (Spoiler: they definitely *did* do that there, just not for her.)

Why is this so hard for companies to normalize? Wouldn’t it make more sense to have open, transparent conversations about pay instead of turning it into a taboo topic?

For those of you who’ve successfully navigated this awkward dance, how did you make it less stressful? And for anyone who’s had a bad experience asking for a raise, what’s your story? Let’s make this topic less uncomfortable, one conversation at a time.

careerguidance,ask for a raise,I accepted an offer and put in  a formal resignation. Then my employer put in a massive counter offer. Should I stay? Context below,"I’ve been at this engineering firm for 6 years. There is a toxic work culture and some big egos but I make it work. There is a history of overworking and underpaying. I have kicked ass the entire time and have been recognized for my work. I have not been properly compensated but have been promised to eventually receive a promotion into a leadership or even an executive role. After being shut down in December when requesting a reasonable raise I applied to a competitor. 

This competitor gave me a really nice offer and I accepted. Upon receiving my resignation I was offered an even larger counter offer with a “map” of my future positions and compensation. I’m tired of being there and want to move on but the counter offer is pretty wild. 

Any advice? Haven’t slept in days. I feel lost. I can give numbers if necessary. Thank you!!

Edit:

The results are unanimous. I really appreciate the advice. I need to move forward. Not back

Another update to my counter offer:

They just offered me the manager role today. 25k compensation increase every year including 2025 for 4 years. And large bonus increases beyond. I have it all in writing 

Edit: 

Seriously, thank you for the input everyone. I haven’t responded to but I have read every comment. I declined and then our VP pulled me in to talk today. Here is where we are at. 

This is a legally binding contract signed by the employer. As long as I am employed I will follow the following pay scale from 2025 to 2028

140k - 160k - 180k - 200k guaranteed. With incentivized bonuses as well that can take me higher. He said they dropped the ball and have regrets. He will also pay me retrospectively with new salary year to date  

I am working towards my PE license and will receive 8.5k bonus when I get that and with paid “study” days off. 

AND we are opening another engineering group in a city my wife and I could be interested in moving to and he said I would be granted permission to move there in a leadership role. I am asking to include a clause that a transfer would still have to respect our contract. 

So with what I’ve learned is I should leave. But if I stay I need to be 1000% sure to cover my ass Incase they are covering theirs. I am thinking of 
asking to include a payout clause as well

The job is easy that I really only need 2 hours per day to do my tasks. I have projects but they don't really have deadlines. I'm not a manager so I don't have people working for me. It's a pretty chill job. My only negative is that I get bored. I feel like I'm not growing as a person. There's less than 100 people in the company and I'm pretty much the right hand man of the owner. He asks for my advice and we work together on any venture or projects. There's no growth. I just got a week extra pto as a ""raise"" and 5% bump last month. So that's my growth there. What would you do? Keep the easy job that pays $140k a year or find a job that pays potentially more and challenging that helps you grow as a person?

I appreciate everyone's input even if they're brutally honest. A lot of people recommend hobbies outside of work. I got plenty. I play the guitar, piano, snowboard, model kits, travel, churning, cook, read books, workout.

I appreciate the people who recognize this is not a ""wankbait"" as one of the commentors put it, and more of a feeling of uselessness and guilt from pretending to work for YEARS. Do you ever play a video game and you beat it and you have all the money and skills and powers then you don't know what to do next? It feels like that. You have this urge to move on or start a new game but you worked so hard to get there. 

But like you guys said, I need to self improve and make use of my 6 hours of free time. I'll also apply for jobs to see what's out there.

careerguidance,ask for a raise,Gave my Notice and I was Told to Leave Immediately?,"Hi all,

Not sure where else to post this - I am in shock about what happened today.

I work at a healthcare-related nonprofit as an event planner. I knew that I wanted to go back to school and get a professional certification this Summer, so I gave a six week’s notice to my manager as a head’s up. Essentially, I would be resigning one day after my next big fundraiser, and this would give me time to write a transition plan for my replacement. I care about the cause that my organization raises funds for, and I wanted to leave things in the best shape as possible.

I verbally told my manager this plan, and she was grateful for the head’s up. After this meeting, I put this in a letter format and sent it to my manager and our Human Resources liaison.

Today - a week later - I was invited to a 12 PM meeting at 11:47 AM. The Human Resources liaison and my boss’ boss were there. They told me that they accept my resignation, and I will be paid for the remaining 6 weeks, but that I must leave immediately. They made me take off my badge and leave my laptop in the meeting. When I asked if I could log in to my email for a final time to email a goodbye to my professional contacts and fellow employees, they told me to pack up my cubicle and leave as soon as possible.

I didn’t even get to say goodbye to my manager or coworkers that I’ve worked with for years, and I didn’t get to leave any type of  transition plan for my replacement. I’m confused and upset by this cold goodbye, and I feel totally blindsided.

careerguidance,ask for a raise,Asking for a 12% raise after 6 Months?,"I signed with my current company about 7 months ago in October. During my initial hiring phase, the company lowballed my comp range ( I mentioned 85-90, they offered 75). However, the recruiter told me I would be eligible for about $20-$25K in bonuses. I had a competing offer that also amounted to ~$105K, which I mentioned to them, but ultimately decided to go with the lower base at my current company.

Flash forward 5 months and we have now had a “company wide change” to erase some of the promised bonuses I would receive, making my total comp 90K. The bonuses used to be supplementary “profit sharing” bonuses, and the CEO decided that this wasn’t necessary anymore.

I’ve checked online, for a similar role at competing companies I would be offered over $120k. I talked to their recruiters and unfortunately I have been at my current company such a short time it’s probably not smart to jump ship.

My next alternative is just arguing with my employer. I had an initial conversation with them and they had eased some concerns, but not $15k worth. How do I go about this? Is it egregious to ask for $10k more in base comp?

careerguidance,negotiate salary,Should you always negotiate salary?,"A few years ago, I heard that if you receive a job offer, then you should always negotiate salary.

The idea was that when a company makes an initial offer, they're expecting the candidate to counter-offer and have allocated an extra 10%-20% to the hiring budget for that role.

If you don't negotiate salary, then you're leaving money on the table.

Also, if a company rescinds an offer due to the candidate attempting to negotiate, then that company likely has a toxic work environment where employees are undervalued and overworked.

However, the job market heavily favors employers right now, and there are hundreds (or thousands) of applicants for every job opening.

I recently applied for a job at a big company. They didn't had the role I wanted but did had a different role that was higher. It's a management and I made the mistake by giving my salary range.

Well, in my head I wanted the minimum to be something I would accept. It is in fact higher than my bare minimum. But now I am also considering another company that did had the lower position role, and it didn't pay that much less compared to the new demanding management role.

I did some market research about my management role, and I came to conclusion that I could ask around 3-6% higher. Now, this is a bit above my salary range I gave. Should I mention that I did my research and also had an over and the function of the management role isn't align with the salary they offered me?

Secondly, the most important thing for me, is able to start in this new management role, since the role is very high and itll take me a minimum of 5 years to climb to that role, and I am already entering as a freshy. Of course they'll train me and I'll shadow the senior managers and my salary isn't as high, but I think that's fair.

I love to earn a bit more, because I think it reflects better to my role and my background is pretty unique, which the company also offered. They do notice a scarcity so I have a bit more bargaining power. I think since they offered this role, I can try and get 3% higher right, which is still in the salary range.

careerguidance,promotion advice,"After 35+ Years with My Company, I’m Suddenly Receiving Negative Feedback — What Should I Do This Late in My Career?","I’m 66 years old and have been with the same company for over 35 years. 
(Posting from a new Reddit account to protect my privacy, as this involves my current job.) 

I’ve held many roles — warehouseman, driver, scheduler, warehouse manager, operations manager — and helped grow the company from ~30 employees to 180+ across two locations.

In 2020, we were acquired by a much larger company (6,000+ employees, 17+ U.S. locations). My role changed from Operations Manager to Analyst. I taught myself Power BI, SQL, and Snowflake to keep up with new expectations.

During my 2022 review, I was verbally promoted to Senior Analyst (due to salary cap), and given a raise — but I never received a written job description. My new title also wasn’t updated in org charts or internal systems. I brought it up once, but nothing happened. In 2023, I raised it again, and my title was finally reflected officially. That year, I again received a positive review and a raise.

Then came 2024.

Earlier this year, I made a comment in a Teams chat venting frustration about a Power BI bug. My manager responded sharply:

“I don’t understand what you’re working on — that has nothing to do with what we talked about.”

I explained I was venting and clarified that the issue was still related to the same dashboard (just not the same window). He seemed fine with the clarification, but afterward, I began sensing a change — colder tone in meetings, micromanagement, increased scrutiny.

Then came my 2024 annual review — and it was rough. For the first time in my career, I was rated poorly for:
	•	Problem-solving
	•	Timeliness
	•	Meeting preparedness
	•	Not fulfilling the responsibilities of my role

I was blindsided. During the review, I calmly pointed out that I’ve never been given a job description, despite being in this role for two years (only one of which was formally recognized by the company).

Why I’m Posting:

I’ve worked hard to stay relevant and effective through a major company acquisition. I’ve never received a negative review before this year. But now I feel like I’m being quietly pushed aside — or at the very least, judged unfairly without any clear expectations.

At this stage of my career, I’m torn.
	•	Do I push harder for clarity and documentation?
	•	Do I ride things out quietly until I retire (which may be in the next year or two)?
	•	Should I explore opportunities outside the company, even at this stage in life?

Any advice or perspective — especially from others who’ve navigated late-career transitions or corporate acquisitions — would be appreciated",722,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1lxnty6/after_35_years_with_my_company_im_suddenly/,1752282699.0,Apart_Tie93,1lxnty6,advice_seeking
careerguidance,promotion advice,Company rescinded offer after I gave current job my two weeks. What should I do?,"Hello,

After my current company gave a promotion to a new hire I had trained instead of me, I decided to look elsewhere, and signed on with a smaller company in the same industry. I informed the owner of that company that I had put my two weeks in with my current job, and two days later, I got an email that my job offer was rescinded. 

When I told my current job I was leaving, I told them it was just because they don't offer the supervision hours I need for a licensure I am trying to get, unless I join their formal ""apprenticeship program"", which I was not interested in. Could I tell them I reconsidered and want to join the apprenticeship program? Or maybe tell them I just want to keep my current job or something? I never put anything in writing at this point. Just a rather informal phone call with my supervisor.

I don't know what to do. I don't like my current company and badly want to leave, but I sort of live paycheck to paycheck and can't be out of work. 

UPDATE:

I took the advice of just asking my old job for my position back, and they gave it to me, but I can definitely tell the atmosphere is different. I doubt I have much of future there now, like some of you warned me. I'm going to keep looking for a new job in the meantime, and just hope any offer letter I sign won't get taken back... 

For those of you who suggested suing, I looked into that, but since I got my old job back, I didn't actually end up losing a ton of money. I was only out of work for a couple days. And even if I hadn't gotten my old job back, I don't really have money for a lawyer or anything like that. 

I appreciate all of the advice though!",1047,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1kk14g8/company_rescinded_offer_after_i_gave_current_job/,1746970392.0,AerieMurky2553,1kk14g8,advice_seeking
careerguidance,promotion advice,"Company laid me off 2 months ago, now wants me back. Do I return?","Background: I was laid off (“RIF”) two months ago by a company I was with for 7+ years. I was a Regional Director. Myself and the 3 other department Directors (including my boss, Senior Director) were laid off as well (leaving no dept. directors). I started a new job with a different organization 2 weeks ago. The pay is significantly less (-20%), and I now hold a Manager rather than Director title. A couple weeks after the layoff, the company posted a position for a Director for my former department. Since then, the VP of the Dept. has reached out to me twice about considering the position and returning. 

Should I entertain the possibility of returning? 

Pros:
-The new role would be a promotion (Regional Director to Director of the Dept.). 
-Pay increase (not listed on job post, but should be a given considering the title change).
-Besides the higher salary, the benefits with my former organization are much better (substantially more PTO, much higher 401k match, 3x amount of life insurance). 
-They seem desperate, giving me good leverage to negotiate. 

Cons:
-Clearly they’ve demonstrated a lack of loyalty to me as a long tenured employee. 
-The company is disorganized, lacks transparency, and clearly the decision making abilities of executive leadership is questionable. 

If I do consider returning, these are the terms I am contemplating posing to them:
-35% base salary increase from my former salary.
-Remain vested in my 401k, rather than having to restart the vesting process (after 1 year you are 25% vested in the amount the company matched, 50% after 2 years, 100% after 3 years). 
-Guaranteed severance. 3 months severance if terminated without cause/misconduct within less than 1 year of employment. 5 months severance if terminated without cause/misconduct after 1+ year of employment. 
-For consideration-$5000 sign-on bonus with no clawback provision. I did receive a severance when I was laid off of 4 weeks pay, so I am not sure if the sign-on bonus would be an over the top request.

careerguidance,promotion advice,Seeking Career Advice: Lateral FAANG Offer vs. Current FAANG Promotion?,"Hi everyone,

I’m at a crossroads in my career and would love to hear your thoughts!

**Me:** 15 YOE, 10+ at current company, level capped but very close to getting a promotion to a Manager role. I've been doing it for the past 6 months as coverage since my manager left, I expect to get a formal offer next week.

**Context:**

* **Offer from new FAANG:** I’ve received a lateral offer from a new FAANG at my current level with a 20% pay bump. I’d be one of the first hires on a brand-new team, which means a lot of potential for growth as the team is expected to expand hard in the next 12-18 months.
* **Promotion at current FAANG:** I’m close to a promotion at my current company where I’d become a manager of my current team. My total compensation would be roughly the same as the new FAANG offer, but I’d be level-capped and there would be less room for further growth because of the company/team's maturity.

**Key Considerations:**

* **New:** 
   * **Positive:** Chance to build and expand a new team, broader runway for career advancement, no layoffs, great management team, change of scenery is exciting after many years at the current employer.
   * **Negative:** New company, new team culture that can be a hit or miss, possibility to become a manager is on the horizon but not guaranteed, area is new but not core to the company, worst equity/benefits package.
* **Current:** 
   * **Positive:** I’ve been with my current company for a while, have a strong brand there, I'd be taking on a Manager role for a considerably large team, I already do the job and know that I can do it well, good benefits and WLB.
   * **Negative:** No real room for growth past Manager role, been doing the work for a few years so excitement got a bit stale, manager role opened a few times in the past and I was always passed over for it but this time was a bit of a fire drill and they didn't have other options so I got it.

I’m passionate about moving into a people manager role, I've been chasing it for a few years now (as observed by my post history) and it feels amazing to have actually landed it. But I’m also intrigued by the growth potential and the challenge to build a new team from scratch, the leadership team at new FAANG is top notch and my manager would be a really close friend.  
  
I’d appreciate any insights from those who have made similar career moves in the past and how it panned out, I didn't expect these opportunities to surface at the same time so I'm banging my head against the wall to make a decision.

careerguidance,promotion advice,Need advice: Should I pursue a UK Master’s in Data Science or stay for a promotion?,"Hi everyone,
I’m currently 27 (turning 28 soon) and in the middle of a big life decision.

I’ve just received an offer to pursue a Master’s in Data Science in the UK starting later this year. The reason I want to study this field is because I’ve tried different jobs over the past few years—usually staying in each role for about 1 to 1.5 year and discovered that I really enjoy working with data. I worked at a small startup where I had the chance to do some hands-on data analysis for almost a year, and I found myself loving the math and problem-solving aspects of it. Since then, I’ve been taking online courses and decided to apply for a Master’s program, and I got accepted.

However, I just told my current manager (I’m currently working in recruitment/TA), and she told me she really values my work and wants me to stay. She even said if I stay until next year, she’ll promote me to a Talent Acquisition Manager position.

Now I’m torn.

On one hand, I’ve worked hard to get into this Master’s program and I really want to make a career shift into Data. On the other hand, I feel appreciated at my current job, and a promotion is a big deal. I also worry that after finishing my Master’s (around age 29), it might be hard to break into the Data field especially since my past job titles haven’t been in Data, even if some of my tasks were.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation or made a career switch into Data in their late 20s or 30s? How did it go? And do you think it’ll be hard for me to get a job in Data after the Master’s, given my background?

Would love to hear your thoughts

thanks in advance!

careerguidance,promotion advice,Should I Stay in Atlanta with a Promotion or Move to Philadelphia with a New Opportunity? Career Advice Appreciated,"Hi everyone, I’m at a career crossroads and would really appreciate your thoughts.



I’m currently based in Atlanta, working as a Business Intelligence Analyst at a financial services company. I moved here from Brazil about a year ago, and things have been going well — I’ve built strong relationships, learned a lot, and there’s even a potential path for me to step into my manager’s role in the near future if he moves on.



Recently, I was offered a position in Philadelphia, in a different business area (Data Governance). It’s technically a lateral move, but they offered me a raise plus a moving allowance to make the relocation attractive.



When I informed my current manager, he countered by matching the raise and promoting me to a Senior title, which also bumps me into a higher salary band for future increases. This promotion comes with more responsibilities and a stronger growth path within the current team — plus, I’m already well-established in Atlanta.



So now I’m stuck between:

	•	Staying in Atlanta, with a promotion, a matched raise, and a clear potential to move up when my manager leaves.

	•	Moving to Philadelphia, stepping into a new business area with a raise and moving allowance, but starting over in terms of internal relationships and with no immediate promotion.



A few more facts:

	•	I’m 27, aiming to grow into senior leadership or management roles over the next few years.

	•	Cost of living is roughly the same in both cities.



What would you do?

Has anyone faced a similar choice between betting on a known growth path versus stepping into something new with some short-term risk?

careerguidance,job offer negotiation,Received a job offer then they changed all the terms - how to respectfully decline?,"I posted this in another subreddit but I’m also looking for some guidance on how to handle this situation. 

I work for disability services in higher education at a state college. I am not happy with the management in my job and looked for new employment. My former boss referred me for a career services position at my former institution. I applied and received the offer. The dean called me on Friday to review.

During the Friday phone call, she told me I would teach 3-4 1 credit classes in the fall and 4 in the spring. This would give me a 1k stipend for each class, totaling 6-7k extra on top of salary. I would get 10 vacation days, and I was concerned because I had some personal events coming up. She assured me that there will be comp time available through weekend/night events, and I can use the comp time to cover the events if I exceed vacation. Throughout the interview process, she mentioned she was remote a few times and said I could get remote time too. It sounded good. I was willing to sacrifice a bit to try a new position and get some experience in this area. 

Today, I accepted the offer. Did not sign a contract yet. She invited me to a Zoom call with my supervisor (who was out of the office for personal reasons during all these negotiations). During the zoom, I learned following:

1. There is no comp time allowed in the position because if we got comp time “we would never be at work because there are so many weekend/night events.” The job posting says “occasional weekend/night events.”
2. If I stay late for an evening event, I’m not allowed to come in late to make up the time.
3. There’s no remote time available. 
4. They won’t let me teach any of the classes because they feel I have to be trained first. This means I lose out on the stipends. This is a total wtf? Why not tell me this earlier? 
5. They weren’t ok with the start date I asked for after originally being ok with it.
6. They don’t allow you to take any vacation days during the academic year. I get not taking a week off but not even a day…?

I was in such shock and didn’t say anything in the moment. Got off the call and a former colleague told me he got a lot promised to him and it never transpired. I did not give notice to my current job (thankfully!!).

Now I have to figure out how to decline them in the morning which I am struggling with. I’m location bound and do not want to burn bridges, especially because I worked there before and have great connections there. Any guidance on how to gracefully reject? Some people are saying I should tell them the truth that this is a bait and switch, but I worry about being blackballed if I go that route. 

Edit: the zoom call included both the supervisor and dean. The dean promised comp time on a prior phone call then acted like they don’t offer comp time on the zoom. 

Update: I declined the offer stating that after learning more about the position, it is not the right fit for me. The dean wanted to speak to me to “clear things up.” I declined and luckily got a pretty big raise at my current job. I told my former supervisor about my experiences, and she said she wants to tell HR (she is friendly with HR) about the bait and switch.

careerguidance,job offer negotiation,Got a $75K Job Offer After a Layoff But It’s Fully In-Office and I’m Struggling With the Lifestyle Shift. Has anyone had a similar situation?,"

Hi everyone,

I recently got laid off about 2 weeks ago but recently had an interview and I was offered a $75,000 full-time role for a hospital organization. They initially offered $72K, but I negotiated it to $75K which they agreed to as their final offer. I’m thankful, especially in this market.

That said, I have some concerns:

* The position is 100% in-person, 8–5 about 40 mins away .
* There are no separate paid holidays — holidays come out of my PTO.
* PTO is in one general bucket (about 7 hours accrued per pay period), which has to cover vacation, holidays, and sick days.
* For the past 4 years, I’ve been either fully remote or hybrid (2 days in-office max). Going fully in-person would be a major lifestyle shift.
* I have four dogs who are used to me working from home. I’m really nervous about leaving them alone all day especially since they can get noisy or anxious but my spouse comes home from work at about 330pm.
* The recruiter wasn’t clear about schedule flexibility, and I’m not sure if asking about hybrid now would come off poorly after negotiating salary.
* I also noticed on Glassdoor that employee reviews mention issues with retention, which makes me hesitant. If others are leaving, I’m wondering if that’s a red flag and it seemed like they just interviewed me and it was only 1 interview which was this past week.

I have some money saved and will receive unemployment, but I’m really struggling with the idea of giving up the flexibility I’ve had for years. I’m torn between financial stability and long-term quality of life. I am worried they will be strict with their in office times and not have much flexibility and mess with my work-life balance. It seems like a good job but I am worried about my quality of life.

Has anyone dealt with this before?

Is it a mistake to ask for hybrid work now?

Should I accept and try to make it work or keep looking?

careerguidance,how to get promoted,"Husband has been strung along for years with the promise of a promotion, how can he get it? Or is it time to quit?","In 2021 we moved from a nice suburb to a very rural area for my husband to work at a company that his family has strong ties to. He worked there when he was younger before we met, his dad worked there for over a decade, maybe two, and they both are friends/ acquaintances with the higher ups. His boss hired him as a warehouse associate and told him that once he learns the ins and outs he would be promoted to manager in a couple of years. 

For more context: The business is in agriculture and sells fertilizer and chemicals to farmers. He was trained in the warehouse to operate the system that loads the fertilizer in the trucks. The first season was difficult and long but he figured it out and did really well. Over that winter they installed a digital system that was operated through the computer. He was the only employee trained to operate the system. They told him that after the next season if he runs the system well then he would get the promotion. 

That season he was answering calls from farmers and salesmen taking orders, managing the inventory of fertilizer by sending out trucks to pick it up from the river to bring it in the house, while loading the trucks that go out, solely operating the system that loads the trucks, and doing all the paperwork involved with it. He was working 7 days a week from dawn to dark everyday for months with some breaks if there was heavy rain. They didn’t give him the promotion because he was slow at getting the paperwork in, even though he had to do hours of paperwork at the end of the night just to get it in. So they hired some guys to help him with the work load for next season. 

The next season starts and he’s managing the schedules of the truckers, and leading a small crew of guys inside the warehouse to help him and the season performs at record rates. They are moving more product than that warehouse ever has. They upgrade his office, get more salesmen (who are salary), get new trucks for everyone on the sales team, and give him nothing. A 4% raise. Next year, same thing.. etc. He started out at $12.50 with the promise of it transitioning to the manager role which comes with a salary. 

Now he’s at 16.50 and this season he told his boss that he’s going to have to take a step back and let the other guys do more work since they all have the same title. It’s been a shit-show. They are all constantly calling him to help, even though he’s trained other people to use the system, answer the phone, order the product .. they want him to step back up but he’s refused. He told his boss that he can’t support his family and is going into debt to work here. That and we are lucky enough to have support from our parents in emergency situations. 

What do we do?! He’s rightfully pissed off and so am I. He keeps getting told the same thing “they don’t have the budget for raises and they don’t care about titles”. We have a 3yo and 1.5 yo, I stay home with them full time, luckily our bills are cheap because the cost of living here is lower than where we moved from but we can’t go on like this. Does he have any leverage? What’s the move here?

careerguidance,how to get promoted,"My Church Closed Their Daycare, I Opened One… Now They’re Cutting My Pay. Sabotage or Consequences?","Hi Reddit, I could really use some outside perspective.

I’m 25F, I’ve been serving as a youth pastor at my church for the last year and a half. I started part-time, got promoted to full-time last year, and oversee both high school and middle school youth, roughly 90+ kids combined, plus families in crisis, community events, tutoring, clothing drives, late-night calls, the whole deal. I genuinely love this ministry and the kids I serve.

Here’s where things got messy:

Our church daycare had a scandal, daycare staff got arrested, people were fired at the daycare, it was ugly. I stepped up immediately, even though it wasn’t my job, helping the remaining staff keep the daycare afloat. The church leadership promised the daycare would stay open… until a few months later they suddenly and secretly voted to shut it down with a 3-day notice. Parents and staff were blindsided, and the town (small community, very limited childcare options) was devastated.

Parents begged me to open a daycare. After dozens of conversations, I ran the numbers, bought a property, and started the process to open my own center.

Meanwhile, I tried to work with the church, offered to pay rent, carry full insurance, sign a contract assuming all liability, and keep using their space until my own place was licensed. They said no. One pastor literally told me that if I succeeded, it would “prove the church could not do it.”

That’s when things changed.

Suddenly, I had to clock in and out down to the minute (nobody else does), give daily minute-by-minute reports, and was micromanaged to an absurd degree, even though I was still running events every night, Bible studies, Sunday services, youth trips, tutoring, going to funerals, and more. No other pastor in our building works this volume.

Then, after submitting a simple proposal to buy leftover daycare furniture (with their verbal approval), they accused me of “stealing,” locked me out of the building, and finally cut my position from full-time to part-time, but wanting me to keep doing my full-time responsibilities.

At this point, I know I need to resign, but:
	•	If I resign, I fear they’ll immediately cut me off (they did this to the last youth pastor), and I won’t be able to say goodbye to my kids or preach as planned.
	•	I love the community and these kids… but I can’t justify staying after the constant hostility and punishment.
	•	I need to figure out my next move: flexible, remote work that pays $50K+, possibly in sales, writing, corporate life… I just don’t know where to start.

So Reddit:
	•	Am I crazy for thinking they’ve been retaliating against me?
	•	Did I misstep by trying to open a daycare after they abandoned these families?
	•	How should I time my resignation to protect myself and not get blindsided?
	•	Where do people like me even go after ministry? What careers would value someone with people skills, event planning, crisis management, and community work?

Thanks for reading this novel📖 any insight would mean a lot. 🙏

***Update 36 hrs later: I got called into my bosses office this morning and was let go. They stated my vision and view of ministry did not align with the church. I asked if I could leave peacefully and have an opportunity to thank all of my volunteers, parents and students and they said yes. They wished me the best of luck at the daycare and hoped I would be successful in fulfilling the need in the community. It sounds like it will be a very peaceful split. Plus I will be receiving severance until end of August, with full time pay. I did not sign any documents and do not plan on signing anything in the future. Thank y’all for your words of encouragement and support throughout this process and for preparing me to be fired.

careerguidance,how to get promoted,I resigned today. Did I make a mistake?,"I resigned today. Boss took it badly and now I’m having second thoughts. See below:

I’ve worked for a small company for almost 6 years now. I had a mid to senior position at the company and a very good relationship with the family that owns it… I work directly under the CEO right now. 

After I came back from my maternity leave, I decided that this company is essentially dead end and there’s no growth for me here since there’s no positions for me to move into. They are a small mom and pop shop and they regularly have cash flow issues- I don’t believe they’re going out of business or anything but it’s just a small company that has plateaued. 

They also haven’t given me a raise since 2020 , and when I asked for a $15,000 raise last year, they said they can’t afford it and denied me even $5000- just nothing. Not even anything to cover inflation. 

Well, after a month of looking this year, I got an offer at a huge company, same type of role- but lots of growth potential since it’s a big company with lots of positions above me. I will be getting an $11,000 raise, way better benefits, and even an in house pension. It’s also fully remote. 

I accepted the job!

At the same time this happened, my boss at my current job asked me to start working 3 days per week from the office (I’ve been fully remote since 2020). 

I ended up having a disagreement about this with him and we ended up having a meeting over it as it turned into a pretty big argument. I told him I have to think about if it works for me long term. 

Well, he didn’t know I had another job lined up, so when I went in today for a meeting to give my notice- he was shocked. 

He actually started tearing up a bit, asked me if I’m sure this is what I wanted, why I’m making this decision (I reiterated the flexibility is worth money to me, and that being taken away plus my below average compensation for my role- it’s just not going to work for me). 

He said that this isn’t the conclusion he thought I’d come to and he’s really taken aback. 

He then implied that I would have gotten a raise soon, and that when I asked last year, he just needed some more time training me on some more stuff but then I went on maternity leave shortly after so there was a time constraint (this is BS because again, they had lots of time to give me a raise; and didn’t even give me a small bump out of good faith when I asked) 

All in all he was so sad, almost cried, kept hugging me and saying I’ve been such a valuable member, they’re going to miss me, I’ve been here since the company took off etc etc. 

The reason I started applying for new roles is because I often felt like a loser in my professional life because I was at a dead end company making pretty crappy pay ($70,000 per year with no inflation raises, and no signs of promotions even being available to me as I was at my ceiling)

However; as a mom, the flexibility it provided me, how laid back my bosses were etc was a source of comfort for me. I can take the kids to the park during the day, prep dinner, pick up my kids from daycare whenever I feel like etc. 

I was having second thoughts last night but decided to look at the root issue and why I started applying for jobs in the first place. I was reminded that staying here wouldn’t solve the root issue I had which is that I was still at a dead end company, and even though it gave me comfort and flexibility… Flexibility is being taken away in a sense, and I will never grow if I just make decisions off of comfort and it won’t solve the root issue I had which is a mental issue of Knowing I can be further along at this point in my career life. 

However, the CEO’s reaction, which was also my boss, doesn’t make me feel any better and now I just am even more nervous that I let this job go

What if the new job sucks and isnt flexible in terms of management? What if it’s toxic? What if i get laid off since it’s a big company, etc etc. 
So many things going through my head and even though i feel this was the right choice long term i still have doubts. 

EDITED TO ADD: my boss does NOT know i have another job. I did not disclose this to him. I told him I am leaving as long term it won’t work for me and when he asked why I don’t stay on board a bit longer until I find something I made up an excuse as to why it was only 2 weeks notice. 

I also do not feel I did the wrong thing or did wrong by my boss. The reason I am having jitters and doubts is because this job did provide me a sense of security, flexibility and a “lax” culture that is valuable to someone like me who wants to pick up my kids whenever I want etc. I do not in any way feel guilty though for making this decision because of my boss’ reaction. The reason I brought it up is because it kind of makes me feel even more like I am giving up something that (while yes is crappy in ways) is a sure thing. Aka they won’t fire me etc. ",887,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1jf29ki/i_resigned_today_did_i_make_a_mistake/,1742404676.0,Antique-Rich-8268,1jf29ki,advice_seeking
careerguidance,how to get promoted,I just got fired. What do I do?,"I was just terminated from my job. I’ve been for there for 1.5 years and I never expected to be fired. I feel guilty and responsible and I’m in complete shock. I feel like a failure and I don’t know what to do. 

I just got a promotion 2 months ago after asking for it, along with a raise. Today I got called into the office and I was told I was being terminated immediately due to excessive breaks. They began an investigation on the length of my bathroom breaks, and they ranged from 15-30 minutes. I will admit that I knew I was “stealing company time” but everyone does it, and I didn’t think I would get fired. 

I know this is my fault but I don’t know what to do, I’m freaking out. I bought a new car, and recently moved into an apartment. I don’t know how to make those payments. I have about 3 months before I’m completely out of savings and my family is extremely unsupportive so I’m terrified to tell them the truth. I’m sorry for the rant I just don’t know what to do and I’m seriously having an anxiety attack. Ive never been fired from anything before. I’m 24 years old, for context. There’s plenty of people in my department who did the same thing as me, but they’ve been there for a lot longer and apparently the same consequences do not apply to them. I should have known better still.

Will this go on my record forever for future employers? Will I ever be hired again? Please note, this was a career job for me, and I was planning on progressing in this career and I suddenly feel like I’ve ruined my entire life. Severance doesn’t appear to be an option. I didn’t ask a lot of questions, I signed a paper, and I was walked out. Aside from the obvious “apply to other jobs”, I don’t know what to do. Do I have to disclose this termination to all other employers? I also keep hearing how bad the job market is right now and that’s not making me feel better. What am I even supposed to do?

careerguidance,how to get promoted,"How am I getting promoted every year in banking, but still living paycheck to paycheck?","Hi everyone,

TLDR: I’m moving up in banking but not in pay. I’ve gotten promoted almost every year, but my salary is still far below industry standard. I’m currently in Treasury Management, and while I’m hungry for growth, I feel stuck. I’d love advice on what paths are worth exploring next.
⸻

Background:

	•	Started in retail banking (teller > lead teller > customer service)

	•	Moved into Treasury Management about 4 years ago

	•	Promoted every year: now working as Fraud & Escalations Lead in Treasury Management

	•	I’ve taken on a ton: improving systems, fixing pain points, and resolving complex fraud issues

	•	Studying for my CTP (Certified Treasury Professional)

	•	Pay is still embarrassingly low for the amount of responsibility I carry

	•	Married, planning to have kids — and living paycheck to paycheck

⸻

What I’m Struggling With:
	•	I’m great at my job, but I don’t want to plateau here

	•	I’ve made the current role so efficient I’m helping other departments again

	•	I’m eager to grow, but don’t know what the smartest next move is

⸻

Options I’ve Considered:
	•	Sales Officer role in Treasury (post-CTP), which could finally break $100k

	•	Transitioning to business banking or eventually commercial banking, possibly reaching $150k+

	•	Considering lateral moves to other banks or even fintech/consulting, but not sure if that’s too risky

⸻

What I’d Love Input On:
	1.	Are there better-paying roles within banking I might be overlooking?

	2.	Is Treasury Sales a good long-term move, or would you recommend something else?

	3.	Anyone made the leap from banking to fintech, finance ops, or consulting successfully?

⸻

Any insight, experiences, or direction would be deeply appreciated.
Thanks in advance!

careerguidance,how to get promoted,How to deal with not getting promoted at work?,"I have been in my current role now for 6 years, and I know that it took my manager a long time to get anyone good enough to do my job and that they had to go through the recruitment process several times over before I came along. This is key for how I will be feeling later.

After a couple of years my workload started to increase by over 100%, and at that time it was decided my role needed an assistant to it and we hired one. 

Only a couple of weeks after this happened I lost my mum suddenly, an unexpectedly (3 years ago tomorrow), one the easter weekend. I was conscious of the fact my new hire was still inexperienced and I made myself available (in the midst of administering my mums' estate and arranging her funeral) for phone calls to help and logged on and did work from home to ease the burden of my absence. I then rushed back to work not a week after the funeral with all this in mind.

A few months later came an opportunity for a new role in the team and I felt I was ready and had shown an exceptional level of commitment to step up. 

It was not given to me. I took feedback and ensured I acted upon it to prepare me for the next opportunity. 

In the time following I even took part in our organisations programme to train aspiring management. 

Shortly after this I got a job offer from my old company to do the job I had been trying to get before I left, which I accepted. Then out of the blue came a counter offer from my current employer, which I accepted. Currently I am regretting doing this, but it made me feel valued at the time and that my retention was important for my manager, as such offers aren't common working in local government. 

Anyway, another same opportunity came around this month and I applied, gave it everything I could, and the outcome was the same.

The feedback is always someone with more experience. But if that's the policy, why are they offering this programme to train people for management, if the ethos is, no experience, no cookie?

Following this, my manager has not been available to have a 121 meeting with me, and has returned to work yesterday and asked if I would like to put something in her diary to meet. Which I have not done, because I am not chasing anyone for support that they should be providing as part of their job.

I get the impression she has cottoned on to my lack of enthusiasm and cold shoulder, and has not made any attempt to contact me since.

I used to be so proud of my job and the work I do, but I feel like I am more convenient to my employer where I am, and my scope for progression in the team is limited, if at all possible.  

I don't want to look around for another job, because moving companies means starting again with no employment rights, and I can't find anywhere offering my kind of role with anything close to the salary I am enjoying.

I feel stuck, and I am disillusioned, and lacking motivation. What can I do?",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1k0njcs/how_to_deal_with_not_getting_promoted_at_work/,1744818116.0,stejent,1k0njcs,advice_seeking

He is dead set at working at usaa because of how amazing the benefits are and doesnt want to give give any other jobs a chance but i dont want usaa to drain him emotionally and ive tried warning him.

We have been dating for over two years and i cant see myself starting a life with someone that doesnt seem to care they dont make much. Right now he works about 20 hours a week as a server and a slowish restaurant so u can imagine he isnt bringing home consistently good money.

Edit since this post is gaining a lot of traction and i feel like i should clarify a few things. He would be okay with coming to work at USAA because of the benefits, that is something extremely important to him but i think he would hate the call center and so he is stuck on what else he would be interested in doing with a company that also provides very good benefits. He is an extremely hard worker (i worked with him in the past at the restaurant he currently works at so ive seen how great of a worker he actually is first hand) and he does support me and our relationship in other ways like cooking (almost every night), cleaning, helping me take care of my dog and our fish tank.

I would appreciate any and all advice given to help my husband. 

My husband (30M) started a new job in the fall of 2024 in the supply chain sector after being in manufacturing for over 10 years. This has been a massive adjustment on him. 

The team that he was hired into has been nothing but toxic due to this one manager, Taylor (fake name). From what my husband has described, Taylor manages the team by fear and humiliation. They have made multiple snide comments to my husband in private and in front of the entire department. This has lowered his confidence and willingness to do his job. He never gets praised for his accomplishments, but is criticized and shamed for what he doesn’t do. 

I feel horrible as I have never seen him this low before. His energy and mood when he comes home is absolutely tanked. I try to be there the best I can, offering kind words, giving him advice on how to handle her remarks, and telling him to document the interactions he has with them. To be transparent, I don’t think my advice is really that great as I have never encountered a manager like Taylor.

careerguidance,systemic burnout,Should I quit my stable government job in India to pursue a third bachelor’s degree in Germany (more linguistics-focused)?,"Hi everyone,
I could really use some perspective on a major life decision I’m grappling with.

I currently have a permanent government job as a Special Educator with MCD (Delhi) - stable, secure, and hard to get. However, I’ve always had a strong interest in technology and deep learning.

My background is a bit unconventional:
	•	Bachelor’s in Psychology and Statistics
	•	Currently pursuing a Bachelor’s in Computer Applications (BCA) via distance learning
	•	Self-studied programming and already familiar with ML basics

This year, I applied to several Master’s programs in Germany in Computer Science, Computational Linguistics, and Computational Neuroscience, but didn’t get accepted , most likely due to my non-technical undergraduate background.

However, I did get admitted to the BSc in Computational Linguistics at the University of Tübingen, which is a great school known for NLP and AI research. The catch?
The program is more linguistics-focused, especially in the early semesters, not exactly aligned with my deep interest in tech/deep learning, but possibly a stepping stone.

Now I’m at a crossroads:
	•	If I go, I’ll be pursuing my third bachelor’s, in a field not fully aligned with my core goals
	•	I’d have to quit my secure government job, take an education loan, and work part-time to survive in Germany
	•	I’d be away from my home, family, and emotional support system for 3+ years

On the flip side, staying in India keeps me secure but in a career that doesn’t excite me intellectually. I fear regretting not taking this leap. But I also fear burnout from debt, cultural adjustment, and academic pressure in a foreign land.

Has anyone here been in a similar position switching fields, doing a second/third bachelor’s abroad, or giving up stability for passion?

Would you advise me to:
	•	Take the risk now, even if the program is linguistically heavy and the path is unclear?
	•	Or stay, finish BCA, build a strong portfolio, and apply again for a Master’s more aligned with deep learning later (possibly in a different country)?

careerguidance,systemic burnout,Which job offer would you take?,"Hey Reddit, I'm at a major crossroads and could use some outside perspective. I've been wrestling with this for a while, and the clock is ticking.

A little background: Last year was a whirlwind. I was working for a tech startup that helped schools with Apple products—a job I loved and was pretty good at. In fact, I was a top performer. Then, out of the blue, while on Spring Break, I got the call that the company was closing its doors. I spent the next year in a job I absolutely hated, only to be laid off again this spring. Toss in some burnout and depression, and you've got the picture. After five years of being a remote MSP (managing other people's tech), I'm craving a change: in-person work and a chance to build my own systems.

This brings me to now. I have two great job offers on the table, and I need to pick one.

**Job A: The Exciting, High-Risk Venture**

* **Role:** Senior Tech Director for a company launching a Top Golf-style venue.
* **The Vibe:** This company has grown 1000% in five years, and it feels like a rocket ship. It’s a chance to build something from the ground up, change fields, and make a real impact.
* **The Details:**
   * **Compensation:** $150k.
   * **Location:** Fully in-person (30-minute commute).
   * **Time Off:** 3 weeks of vacation the first year, then unlimited PTO after that.
   * **Ownership:** Single owner.
* **The Catch:** Is this explosive growth sustainable? It feels a little risky, but also incredibly exciting.

**Job B: The Safe, Familiar Bet**

* **Role:** The exact same job I was doing before, and I'd be reuniting with my old team from the startup.
* **The Vibe:** Familiar faces, familiar work. It’s what I know and what I'm good at.
* **The Details:**
   * **Compensation:** 10% more salary than Job A, plus a 10% bonus.
   * **Location:** Remote, but requires almost 35% travel.
   * **Time Off:** 6 weeks of vacation.
   * **Ownership:** Owned by a private equity firm. They just closed a branch, so while my job is probably safe, there's always that thought in the back of my head.
* **The Catch:** Remote work with significant travel doesn't sound like a great balance. The job growth potential also seems limited.

**The Family Angle**

This is where it gets complicated. My wife and I have a 9-year-old and a 10-year-old.

* Job A means a daily 30-minute commute (an hour a day away from the family), but I'd be home every night. It gets me excited to build something new, but the PTO is a significant drop.
* Job B means more money, double the PTO, and I could walk my daughter to school most days. However, I'd be on the road for a third of the year, missing out on that time entirely.

I'm ready to be in-person and excited by the potential of Job A, but Job B offers more money, more vacation, and more flexibility *when I'm home*.

What do you all think? Which job would you take and why? Help me get excited about one and see it through new eyes.",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1mgspxz/which_job_offer_would_you_take/,1754250799.0,Zor785,1mgspxz,advice_seeking
careerguidance,systemic burnout,Should I ask for my job back?,"Last week I (25F) started a new job and I’m already feeling unsure about it. For context, I work in the field of international higher education recruitment.

I left my previous role after 3+ years for three main reasons:
	•	Money: I was the lowest paid on my team and in our pay band.
	•	Growth: No room for promotion or advancement to a managerial level.
	•	Burnout: I was juggling full-time work, heavy travel, and a master’s program. After finishing my degree, it felt like a natural time to make a change.

I actually really liked my old team and had a great manager who listened to a lot  the concerns I voiced and made changes where she could. The low pay and lack of advancement weren’t really her fault, it had more to do with how the role was structured, since I was based in a different region than the rest of the team.

The new role came with a higher title and a $15K pay bump. On paper, it seemed like a good move. Same field, just at a new institution. But after a week, I’m not loving it. This is my pros/cons list.

Pros:
	•	Exposure to new systems and perspectives
	•	Learning higher-level skills (forecasting, budgeting, event management)
	•	More money

Cons:
	•	The institution feels more corporate than educational. It’s very KPI-driven and less student-focused, which makes the work feel less meaningful.
	•	More office time: It’s hybrid 3 days a week, 9–6. My old job was hybrid 1–2 days a week, 9–5. When I got the new job, I expected it to be 9-5 as well, but they recently got a directive from the higher ups that they need to work until 6 PM.
	•	The team is smaller, and while nice, I’m not sure I fit in. There’s a very noticeable vibe shift when the manager is around, which feels off.

There are other factors too, but those are the big ones. I’m technically still on vacation from my old job for the next week and keep wondering if I should ask for it back. I can’t tell if I’m just overwhelmed from the transition or if this new job truly isn’t right for me.

Any advice? ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1mk2n12/should_i_ask_for_my_job_back/,1754579345.0,pinkzw,1mk2n12,advice_seeking
careerguidance,systemic burnout,How to recover and make a career transition after severe burnout and mental/physical health struggles?,"I had a severe breakdown/burnout back in 2023 due to mental and physical health , social isolation (covid did not help and I was living overseas), and job pressure. Long-term I need to make a career transition. Right now I am working on my mental health, am in therapy etc. I could use any guidance anyone can provide! Apologies if anything isn't clear, I'm still not at my best. Will post to some other subs as well.

Apologies if this is a bit long. I can cut it down if it's better to focus on specific bits at a time, but there is a bit of context that is necessary to reasonably understand my situation.

**My Background**

* Have a bachelors in Social Sciences, did very well academically
* Working experience is in tech, systems/devops engineering  specifically (about \~3-5 years entry level tech/\~5+ years  in senior position experience - tbh I'm not really senior level in my skillset though, depending on company I suppose)
   * Cloud(aws/gcp), Linux, IAC, automation, ci/cd, etc etc . . . .
   * Have lots of tech certs (expired now though)

**Current Situation**

* Need to keep medicaid until I am well enough to work full time
* Have not worked since December 2023
* Living off of savings (fortunately I have some since I was planning to buy a house)
* Have been doing occasional volunteer work
* Don't have family or friends to fall back on
* Living in the nova/dc area in the US (don't want any jobs with a clearance at this point though)
* Don't have a car, so rely on public transport

**Short-Term Plan (next few months)**

* Therapy, medical appointments, TMS therapy, volunteer work, social activities, planning for job/career
* Start working part-time at some regular job to keep insurance and get ready to go back to full-time work

**Medium-Term Plan (Next year, sooner is better)**

* Start full-time work
* Move to better apartment (high priority for mental health - Want to move before July)
   * I will need to have X number of months with stable income to qualify for a new apartment
   * Sooner is better for this reason, but too soon could be dangerous
   * I will still have a good amount of savings even by next summer so that might help with getting a better apartment
* Start making concrete plans for a career transition

**Long-Term**

* Move either back to west coast or out of country
* Still take work in tech and establish residency (for state school prices) if still in the US
* Save up and then go back to school for something new

**Risks and Requirements For me**

* I need to be able to afford a fairly nice place to live and have medical costs so I need to make a solid income (related to mental/physical health)
* I have very low stress tolerance, though hopefully that will improve
* I still have fairly limited focus/cognition and have only been in a *somewhat* stable place for maybe 3-6 months, so anything that requires a huge amount of cognitive work or difficult certs may not be the best right now (normally certs a piece of cake for me, and maybe in 3-6 months that will be different)
* I need to be making at least solid money by next summer (more is better, but \~70-80K would probably be a safe target given my situation). My old job would easily pay 120-150k+ in this area. Once I'm doing better/have savings I plan to move to a less expensive area, but right now it's important to be in a place with good public transportation etc.

**The Questions**

* Any recommendations on starting back to work part-time?
   * I can't find much in the way of devops work that is part-time, afaik it doesn't really exist
   * I do plan to just take some dead-end, whatever job to start getting things moving, is that a bad idea?
* Any recommendations on a full-time job that I should look for to start making money again and to start saving for a career transition?
   * The easiest thing to do would be to go back to devops/platform engineer/systems engineer
      * This would pay well and help me rebuild savings and has enough demand that I could start to save for going back to school
      * High risk of burning out again; I could look for a low-pressure environment, some bigger company etc, but there is always a risk
   * I've thought about transitioning to some others, but alot of them would take time and I don't think I could just move to most of the immediately. Some options
      * IAM (probably would take time)
      * Security/Vulnerability Analyst (Might be able to get in quickly with engineering background?)
      * Risk Management (probably would take time)
      * GRC (Would require time and certs)
      * Technical Writer (I feel like this would be ideal, but Idk how hard it would be to get into, and medium-long term I feel like ML/LLMS will take this over)
* Recommendations for what I should list on my resume/tell employers when they ask about my resume gap? I tend to be overly honest, but some  advice I have gotten from others fall along the lines of: tell half-truths or make something up to fill the space. I'm really bad at this kind of stuff and am not really sure what I should do. I hate the idea of lying or even telling half-truths, but I have alot at stake here.
   * I could say something like:
      * I decided to move back to the states and so took some time to travel before doing so
      * I took time off take take care of family-related health problems
      * Took a sabbatical
      * Say I tried some independent consulting or something (seems very risky)",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1mk29fp/how_to_recover_and_make_a_career_transition_after/,1754578502.0,expat377,1mk29fp,advice_seeking
careerguidance,systemic burnout,"38, non-linear path, chronic illness, lots of ideas/skills – how do I present myself?","Hi Reddit,
I’m writing this because I feel completely stuck. I’m 38, currently unemployed, and living in Italy. I have fibromyalgia and struggle with mental health, which makes things incredibly hard on both a physical and emotional level.

Despite it all, I still want to believe there’s a place in the world of work for someone like me. I’m not giving up—at least not yet.

The biggest issue is this:
My career hasn’t been linear. Not even close. I’ve faced countless interruptions—burnout, health crashes, life throwing me curveballs. I’ve reinvented myself more times than I can count. I’ve done a lot, learned a lot—but I struggle with how to present it all in a way that makes sense to others.

I used to be a tour manager, organizing and handling logistics for artists and live events. It was a job that taught me resilience, adaptability, and problem-solving under pressure. But now, due to physical limitations, I can no longer work in roles that require frequent travel or movement. That’s been a painful shift to accept—but I’m trying to find a new way forward.

Here’s what I’ve done (and still do):

 ✏️ Content writer and sports podcaster – I’ve written for football platforms and hosted wrestling shows and Serie A football shows;
 🎙️ Podcast host – I write, produce, record, and promote my own podcast.
 📚 I run a personal blog, where I share reflections on environment, green and sustainability;
 💻 I completed a Web Developer course – I’ve studied HTML, CSS, JavaScript and gained a foundation in front‑end development.
 🌐 I created my own portfolio website as a digital showcase for my skills and projects.
 📱 I developed an app to support survivors of parental narcissistic abuse – it’s a safe, empathetic space offering guidance and tools for healing. It was both a personal and technical project, and one I’m proud of.
 🧠 I’m the creator and game master of an online roleplay game (Play‑by‑Chat) set in Chicago, where I write complex storylines and design interactive narrative systems.
  🌍 Profiles on Upwork and Fiverr, offering writing, podcast editing, and basic web dev gigs—but I haven’t been able to make them bring in consistent clients or income.
 🇬🇧 Fluent in English, both spoken and written.
 ❤️ Strong soft skills: empathy, adaptability, creativity, critical thinking, storytelling.
 💡 Exploring vibecoding – a more intuitive, emotional, and playful approach to coding and digital creation.

Even with all this, I still don’t know how to “sell” myself. I don’t fit the mold. I’m a generalist with a patchwork of skills—and recruiters seem to prefer specialists with polished resumes.

What I’m looking for is a flexible, creative, meaningful role where I can leverage my voice, writing, and ideas. Ideally remote or hybrid, to suit my health needs.

If you’ve been in a similar spot—or have advice on turning freelance platforms into sustainable income, crafting a career from a non‑linear path, or positioning generalist talents as valuable—I’d be beyond grateful to hear from you.

Before I give up, I want to believe: there’s still a place for someone like me out there…or do I have to surrender and full stop?

Thanks for taking the time to read this. Even a kind word helps more than you know.

TL;DR:
 38, with fibromyalgia and mental health struggles. Non-linear career with many gaps. Writer, podcast host, former tour manager, green content creator, game master, now learning web dev. Lots of ideas but no clear path. Still studying. Feeling stuck.
 How do I present this mess as value?
 Thanks for reading. ❤️

careerguidance,systemic burnout,Solo Developer at Startup for 3 years—Stay or Quit?,"Hey all,

I’m the only developer at a product-based startup building a manufacturing ERP.

Built every feature (backend, frontend, infra) myself.

Pay: ₹70 k/month—and it’s often late.

Burnout: three years fixing the same system.

Interviews scare me because I’m not fully confident in my spoken English.

Side income: I’ve freelanced since the start of my career, have a few new projects lined up, and a SaaS idea for industrial clients.

careerguidance,boss is a bully,"A coworker has been written up in the past for bullying me and has been promoted and is my boss. How do I manage, or what rights do I have?","Hi all. I figured this would be a good place to ask this.

Long story short, I'm a contractor so this issue and story spans two companies, two contracts, and a total of three bosses. I'm also on my phone so please forgive any formatting issues.

I have been in my position for over three years now and was warned by many people about one older coworker. She's been divorced four times and blatantly said to my face once she hates and doesn't trust men. Years ago she bullied another team member and when I joined up she moved onto bullying me. I told my boss at the time about it and nothing got done and I eventually got HR involved. Unfortunately a contract and company change disrupted that. I have many pictures, screenshots, and recorded conversations with many coworkers over the issue.

New company comes in with a new boss. He knew about the issues. Another team member, a younger woman, decided to become a protege of the bully and also started in on me. During this time another team member quit, citing bullying by the younger woman as well. The two bullies were placed on PIPs. A few months later these two start on another documented path to try and get me fired with no evidence but the boss who put them on a PIP was replaced and new boss didn't know the full story. Another letter to HR and nothing happened.

As of Monday my team lead, who has been crucial in me keeping my job and protecting me from their claims announced he's quitting. To my surprise, the younger bully, who again has been written up for her actions, is going to be my boss in two weeks. I have another call with HR tomorrow about this as I'm floored no one sees an issue with this. Every few months these two have continued to try and dig up anything they can and take to our bosses trying to get me fired, and they have no proof, and I have no performance issues or write ups myself.

Any advice? I have countless screenshots, pictures, recorded conversations, as well as the last boss willing to help out however he can, even so far as recommending me an employment attorney.

careerguidance,boss is a bully,Why am I so disliked at work that I can’t hold a job…? And how can I solve?,"I’ve been in 2 companies at this point post MBA. Both have (current job will in 3 months) been terminated for the same exact reason ultimately:

Executive presence and likability. Actual job performance is solid (not exceptional though) - moving projects along and even coming up with several novel approaches to problems. I make people money ultimately, but apparently my personality doesn’t outweigh that.

This isn’t a problem that I just had yesterday: I was bullied and uncharismatic my entire childhood, from K to 12. I was very much the outgoing kid that wanted everyone to be their friend, and ultimately got taken advantage of a lot for it. So i have a highly extroverted personality, but life has taught me to be highly introverted due to the cost-benefit in being hurt and betrayed by people.

In college I also wasn’t very well liked. I tried making friends but I ended up either getting fun of or having people ‘forced’ to interact with me due to being a shared club officer or similar (this will become a trend moving forward). I only ended up having a couple friends from college, but those friends are lifelong at this point.

Ever since college, I’ve never been able to hold a job longer than 2 years. And only a couple times it’s been due to performance. I had one job where my boss would routinely insult me as ‘weak’ and eventually got let go. My first job out of college was very similar: I would get insulted by my type A boss daily, and when I decided to leave because of both being constantly disrespected and underpaid, he begged me to come back.

Even at my first job out of my MBA, the VP right before firing me from my PIP gave me a whole lecture on how I am a weak person.

When returning to my full time MBA, I can tell I was labeled as one of the ‘weird ones’ in my class. It felt very forced when people ever included in things, and often I would have gotten excluded.

I think I might be undiagnosed Asperger's or some kind of issue. There has to be a reason why for my entire life it just seems people are so utterly negative about me. Or maybe some other condition? Idk….

It seems like the universe wants me to do a job that’s highly technical and doesn’t interact with people, but I find those kinds of jobs utterly boring. I thrive when I get big puzzle problems and leading a project and team. The issue comes in how to get people to like me back…

I’ve read How to win friends, and various other books on social introversion and shyness over the years. They’ve helped to get over the trauma from past experience in childhood, but the underlying issues (whatever that is) keep following me.

I’m starting to suspect it’s mannerisms: I have a hard time sounding confident when grilled by those in authority. I use a lot more hand gestures than normal. I have a fairly raspy voice that could sound like a chipmunk. And I have a habit of talking about long form problems and going into tangents (my MBA coach would say I had a ‘nutty professor’ problem when recruiting).  I also stutter and talk way too fast. Those mannerisms get judged, and people make assumptions about competence even though there’s no reason to assume so.

Because at work I keep to myself for the most part: I intentionally stay quiet and don’t really talk about my personal life all to much. I don’t think I intentionally come off as annoying…but it’s highly possible that my mannerisms and unaware behaviors may.

I do a really good job at making a solid first impression to hiring managers because I do talk fast and have a strong strategic mindset, but that ‘nutty professor’ behavior bites me on the ass after awhile I think in staying credible.

Has anyone interacted with people like what I’m describing? Are there ways I can learn to either ‘fake it’ or just embrace what I am?

I’ve gone to therapists so many times and they’ve never diagnosed anything wrong with me: as a kid because I was bullied so much my school forced me into a psychiatry program to assess me for a long time, and the therapist after months evaluated that if anything I was too mature for my age, and that the only issue was I have ADHD and hyper sensitive…but reason to explain it. In college the staff psychologists evaluated me and said I simply lacked social skills training and recommended exposure therapy (which did work). I’ve done various teletherapy since and they’ve never diagnosed anything wrong.

I’m thinking of starting a business once I get my next job because it doesn’t seem I can hold a job no matter how hard I work. If I can’t get people to like me, then I need to sell them things where they don’t have to like me to give me money. At least that’s the theory….

Thank you all and appreciate any advice!!!

careerguidance,boss is a bully,"Found out a group of coworkers planned to work together to report “someone,” turns out it was me. Now HR is investigating, is this workplace bullying?","I was informed I’m being investigated by HR due to a complaint. The nature of which hasn’t been shared with me yet. But I suspect it’s related to work performance. The same day I learned of the open investigation, my coworker, let’s call her Mary, told me she overheard 3 of our coworkers discussing amongst themselves, a plan to collectively document and report someone. Mary didn’t hear who the target was but did hear the 3 people planning on working together to report someone systematically. Given that I was just notified of an open investigation against me, I can only assume that I was/am the target of that plan. 

**Background:** I have had a history of being bullied by these 3 people. Mary, who witnessed the conversation, also has been experiencing bullying by these people. Also, 1 of the 3 people involved in this conversation, **does not work directly** with the 2 other people. Let’s call this person Ann. Ann is in a different department than the other 2 parties, and so her inclusion in the conversation seems to be very inappropriate given the lack of professional responsibilities she shares with these people.  In the past, I had to report Ann because she publicly berated me and negatively gossiped about me to coworkers at our job, including the 2 people in the group conversation mentioned above. The incident in which she verbally accosted me, was so extreme, that gossip about the incident, swirled around our entire company for weeks. Both my manager and HR know about it, and never reprimanded her or opened a formal investigation. Because of this, I had to take a mental leave of absence because the bullying and humiliation had become so severe. I was approved for FMLA. 

Anyway, based on the above, I have suspicions one of the 3 made the formal complaint to HR about me. I suspect this has to do with my work performance over the last 3 months. During this time, we’ve lost 3 team members, and so everyone in my department is more or less working overtime, under crazy hours, with little to no support staff. For my project, I have had a few days where I’ve had no support, so I’ve had to wear double hats. I think for the most part I’ve actually faired quite well, but there have been some days where my deliverables have fallen short and I’ve been late. This has negatively impacted the 2 aforementioned people in that group conversation. My boss has talked to me about this, and I agreed I could do better, but at the same time, if my work load is increasing but the staff count isn’t, output is going to slow down because I’m doing the job of TWO, rather than focusing on my own job. I have not been put on any formal PIP. But who’s to say i won’t be after this HR investigation? 

**UPDATE:** Turns out I’m not the one being investigated. HR took several days to follow up with me but when they did (after I asked to have a union representative present) they informed me I wasn’t the subject of their investigation, they apologized for the misunderstanding and said they realize they could have handled it better, but didn’t mean to give me the impression I was in trouble.

careerguidance,boss is a bully,At what point did you realize your job was toxic - even if no one else saw it?,"I used to think “toxic workplaces” meant screaming bosses or outright bullying. But what I have learned is that some of the most harmful work cultures are the quiet ones—the ones that wear you down slowly.

Here are some signs I have experienced and heard from others. Signs 1, 3, 5 and 7 especially resonate with me and wish I had recognized them sooner.

1.	Being left out of key decisions (even when they affect you directly)
2.	Getting passive-aggressive feedback instead of clear communication
3.	Feeling like your time and boundaries do
not matter
4.	Being told you are ""too sensitive” or “not a team player”
5.	A constant blame game—no one ever takes real accountability
6.	Getting praised for overworking, but not supported when you are struggling
7.	Dreading work every day, even when “nothing’s wrong”

I did not clock these things right away. It just felt like I was always tired, anxious, or second-guessing myself. Took me a while to realize: it was not me. It was the environment.

What about others? Did you experience any or all of the 7 signs above? Feel free to add to the list.
Was there a moment when it clicked for you—that your workplace was not just difficult, but actually damaging?

I would love to hear how others figured it out (or what you are noticing now).",206,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1mdzfh3/at_what_point_did_you_realize_your_job_was_toxic/,1753962637.0,Escapetivity,1mdzfh3,advice_seeking
careerguidance,boss is a bully,Is 28 too late In life to start over with a new career? I feel behind in life,"I am 28 female. I live with my boyfriend who is 27. We have a rental house and both have jobs. He recently started going back to college to better our future. I'm super proud of him. It sucks that we don't have as much time together anymore but I understand that's part of working and going to school. With me having more alone time since he's in school it's given me more time to think about my life. Which has lead to some depression. 

I have been struggling in my work industry (for privacy reason I won't go into detail but I work in the beauty industry) for a few years and debated on switching careers. But Instead I got a new job at a different company doing the same thing I do now. And It has absolutely drained me and killed my confidence and mental health. I am so depressed and anxious all the time. And im very bullied by my boss. So that solidified that I want to switch industries. Ive  decied what i want to do for a new job. I'm looking for some kind of office job. Like administrative assiant or something. Hopefully I can work my way up through a company and I've gotten great advice from people in that industry. 

I'm just scared that it's too late In life for me to start with a new career. And not having my boyfriend around as much to encourage that growth doesn't help as much. But i know that's just because he is in school and working. And besides I should be able to encourage myself. 
I see all these people my age that got good jobs early on and are married and have a house and good careers. And the fact that I'm failing in my career make me feel like a lover. 

And im worried because my whole adult life ive only worked in the beauty industry so I'm worried that no other job will want me since I don't have experience in anything else. Which is another reason why I'm leaning towards office work because their are entry level positions for that. I'm just struggling so bad and keep telling myself I fucked up by choosing the career path I did and now I just have to deal with that forever.

So last Thursday I got a job offer and accepted it! The only issue is I am struggling with the guilt of quitting. I get my paycheck today and I want to be done here once I cash the check. I don’t think I can put a two week notice in and suffer here any longer. I want to quit today and not come in tomorrow. I just am curious how bad it would be for me to email and quit. Is it too unprofessional? Is it a bad way to start my career? The thing is - I’ve only been here 3 months and I’ve already secured a new job. Does it matter that much? I could just take this job off my resume. I know I should just do the right thing professionally and work the last days I’m required to. But I want out of here. I can’t take it one more minute. Also she’s been horrible to me. Why should I respect someone who has absolutely no respect to me?

careerguidance,boss is a bully,Are you screwed if your manager doesn’t like you? How do you win over a toxic/bully boss?,"I’ve been working in corporate America for a very long time. Looking back, there have been 3 instances where I’ve been “nudged” out of my role, and in all of these cases, I had a manager (or an influential stakeholder) who decided they didn’t like me and I was bullied.

I don’t think my capabilities/work product were the issue because I had established a positive track record/performance reviews. In one of these instances, I had been in the role for six years and had consistently “exceeded expectations.” But then I got a new manager, and it all went downhill.

I sincerely believe that two of my bullies were simply insecure women and felt threatened by me, and that’s why they treated me so badly. In my most recent role, I had a manager who simply had a volatile personality and liked to throw temper tantrums.  

About me: I care about doing good work . I’m collaborative and polite. I always say “please” and “thank you.” But I have a very low tolerance for mistreatment. When someone is mean or bullying me, I don’t respond in anger or lash out at them. Rather, I tend to shut down and avoid them. I continue to perform my work, but I feel upset and the relationship remains tense. Upon reflection, I think the bully manager sees me not trying to ingratiate myself to them (kiss ass) and this seems to infuriate them even more.

I think the best recourse is to LEAVE and find a new job. But of course, that’s easier said than done and finding a new job takes time.

I likely need to work at least another 10 years before retiring, and I want to survive corporate life with minimal drama. 

Maybe I’m totally dense, but I think I’ve underestimated the importance of this relationship with your manager.  I’ve had some amazing bosses. But in the cases where my manager didn’t like me and I’ve been bullied, it was a really bad situation and I had to leave the job.

I’ve never been one to play office politics and strategically ingratiate myself to leaders/colleagues, but maybe this is a skill I need to learn? 

I’d love to hear from others who are politically savvy about corporate life and the ”soft, unspoken skills” needed for success.

Are you totally screwed if you have a manager that doesn’t like you? If you find yourself in a precarious situation with a toxic manager who is bullying you, what should you do? Are there any strategies you can employ to help repair the relationship and get on the manager‘s good side?",27,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1j7mse2/are_you_screwed_if_your_manager_doesnt_like_you/,1741568605.0,mandoo-dumpling,1j7mse2,advice_seeking

I applied for a position with a smaller city before I got sacked (meaning my resume reflected I'm still employed), and tomorrow I'll be going in for my in person interview. I'm perfectly qualified for this position, but because the jobs are so similar, I fear I'll be questioned on my experiences. I'm afraid of the ""tell me about your current job"" question. For the sake of transparency, should I just throw it out there tomorrow that I no longer work there?

For added context, I was severely bullied by my boss who fired me after putting me on a pip and harassing me for weeks. However, this was also alongside talks of budget cuts and staff reductions, which I assume could have played a role in me being pushed out. 

Since all PIOs know each other here, I'm worried they will try to contact my old boss... Or, at the very least, the HR team (who did nothing to help me with the bullying). What can I say to best handle this question should it come up, both now and for potentially future interviews?

UPDATE: I took all your suggestions to my interview today, but I didn't feel comfortable lying. I decided not to bring it up if I could help it. I was mostly concerned with saying ""I currently do this at my job"" or refer to it in the past tense. When they noted my interview change from 5 to 2pm, they asked me if I was able to get out of work early or something. I decided to be honest and explain my lay off for the sake of transparency, and they acted so cool about it, understanding the difficult climate we're in.

I’ve been here 2.5 years, working Monday to Friday, 9am to 6pm, managing around 1,000 contractors.

The biggest issue is internal staffing. For the entire time I’ve worked here, it’s just been me and an admin in the office. The first admin was great but left after a year. Every admin since has been let go for poor performance, and the last one was fired a month ago. Now I’m doing the job of three people — for the fourth time — with no support.

I’ve repeatedly asked for a third team member, especially after bringing in a $2M project, but management won’t approve it. I’m constantly working after hours, attending weekend client meetings, and sometimes starting at 5am — carrying this entire branch on my back for over a year.

I’m burnt out and exhausted. I’ve tried resigning before, but they convinced me to stay. Now it’s affecting my physical and mental health — I had nightmares about work this weekend and woke up crying and screaming. I feel trapped.

I live in a remote mining town with limited job opportunities. I have $30k in savings, my partner covers rent while I pay utilities and shopping — but I’m scared for my finances if I quit and scared for my well-being if I stay.

I have 2 upcoming interviews for the jobs I’ve applied for but I can’t just hold on to that, for obvious reasons.

Just two days after being promoted to manage an audiovisual communications department in DC, which is a role that I moved across the country for, I was told that my position is being eliminated. No sugarcoating, no time to adjust. C’est la vie.

I’m a military veteran with nearly a decade of federal service. Before that, I worked in film and television. I’ve got an MBA, multiple certifications, and a solid track record of leadership and high-performance. But none of that seems to matter in the job market I’m facing now.

I’ve applied to hundreds of roles in the past few months. From communications, production, to management, etc. and have barely heard anything back. I know the private sector sees my resume and probably thinks I don’t fit the mold. They’re probably right. I haven’t spent my career climbing the corporate comms ladder. I took a different route. 

I am not complaining, but I am scared. 

I’m staring down 40 with a 7-month-old daughter, no stable income, and no clear direction. I’ll do whatever it takes to support my family, but I genuinely don’t know what that should be. A total career pivot? More school? Freelance work?

Has anyone made a successful jump from government/creative work to a completely new career later in life? What industries or paths are realistic and worth pursuing at this point?

Any perspective is welcome. I just need to know this kind of reinvention is still possible.

***update***

I just wanted to take a moment to say thank you to everyone who took the time to read and respond to my post.

When I wrote it, I was in a dark place, and was definitely doomscrolling in the wee hours of the morning/evening. This led to feeling overwhelmed by fear, uncertainty, and the pressure of being a new dad facing an unexpected career crisis at almost 40. I expected maybe a few kind words or suggestions, but what I got instead was an outpouring of encouragement, wisdom, and perspective that truly lifted me up.

So many of you reminded me that 40 isn’t the end. That I’m not “too late” or “too far behind.” You helped me reframe what I thought was a failure and see it for what it is: a tough chapter, not the whole story.

Several people were quick to point out that I have been successful, and that I’ve already seen some tough paths, and built a foundation worth being proud of. You reminded me that GRIT doesn’t disappear just because the path gets unclear.

Others shared their own journeys, of losing jobs in their 40s, 50s, and even 60s, and still finding new beginnings. I was blown away by the honesty, the vulnerability, and the real proof that reinvention is possible at any age. Some of you are enduring even greater challenges right now, and yet still offered words of strength and hope.

To everyone who reminded me that my job doesn’t define me, that this is survivable, and that I owe it to myself and my daughter to keep pushing forward, thank you. Truly. It means more than my words can really say. 

I don’t have it all figured out yet, but I feel lighter now. More hopeful. And I’m looking inward to find that tenacity you all reminded of. 

Whatever you might be going through, whether you’re on your way up, starting over, or just holding on, I’m rooting for you, too. We’re all in this together.

careerguidance,surviving my job,"If you needed a new career, but were in 100K school debt, what would you do to get started in a new career?","EDIT: Thanks for the replies and suggestions. As previously stated in my post, I have tried using my education and clinical experience to transition into a career that is healthcare adjacent. When my job applications are acknowledged (which isn't often) I am either told I'm over-qualified, or that my clinical experience is insufficient for what they are looking for, or not in the right specialty, or just rejected with an automated rejection email. I usually end up somewhere in the middle gray area where applications go to die, whether for CROs, insurance companies, billing/coding companies, or medical device companies. My applications for jobs for medical writing, teaching, IT support, etc. were never responded to beyond a ""thank you for applying"" automated type response.

As for my student loan debt, I mentioned it specifically so those making suggestions would understand why I cannot afford to go back to school to train for a new career. Not that I owe anyone an explanation or justification, but my loans were originally 165K - I managed to pay a significant chunk back already. I was not seeking a way to stop paying loans, or achieve loan forgiveness; only suggestions for careers that could potentially be entered without experience or education. I do understand the benefits of working for non-profits, public sector, etc., however and thank those who suggested that as a possibility. I get where you're coming from and see nothing wrong with those who try that route.

I appreciate the time everyone took to make a comment that was sincere and without snark. I will most likely continue with my plan to move to a new area, potentially living out of my vehicle if I can manage it, and see what I can find with a staffing agency or the like for a ""meantime"" job until I can find something that perhaps will provide a career opportunity.

Thanks again!

I'm over 40, male, not really capable of a physical labor job anymore. I have an advanced degree in a healthcare profession, but left due to mental health reasons. I decided that returning to that field is simply not an option any longer. I have 100K in student loans remaining, but have no other debts. I do have a vehicle that is fully paid for and this is basically my only asset. I have no retirement, savings, etc. I have no partner or children, so financial responsibility only includes student loan payment of $1,200/ month and expenses to survive, i.e. food, rent, utilities, etc.

I have now been unemployed for one year. I have tried to use my education and ""transferable skills"" to apply to other jobs that are healthcare related without any luck, mainly due to minimal experience and my degree is now over 5 years old.

I am trying to find a way to begin a new career, but with my current student loans, I would not be able to return to school.

My job is absolutely destroying my mental health. I’m underpaid, overworked, and the bosses are genuinely horrible narcissistic people. I’ve been job hunting for a while and had loads of interviews, but there’s always someone with more experience or just a better fit. It’s draining.

This job has completely wrecked my confidence. I used to feel like a decent developer (I’m a frontend developer), but now I question if I’m even good anymore. I don’t hate development and I do enjoy it on the job when I’m treated well and working on something meaningful. But outside of work, I’m not one of those people constantly building side projects or keeping up with every new framework. I often struggle talking to other tech people because they seem so interested in it all and it seems to set me apart from a lot of others in tech. Still, I feel like it’s worth trying another dev job before switching careers completely.

The major issue is I have no savings. My low pay combined with not being great with money has left me in my overdraft. I can’t afford to just walk away as I know the financial stress would only worsen my mental health, but staying feels like it’s slowly killing me too.

I’m so unmotivated now. I can’t get into a focused headspace, I procrastinate constantly, and I rely on AI to help get basic things done because I can’t bring myself to care anymore. I want to care, I want to be better, but I feel so stuck in this depressed state.

careerguidance,constantly overworked,Is Now the Right Time to Switch Jobs Given the Current Economy?,"Hello everyone,

I’ve been in my current role for a little over two years, and I’m starting to feel like it’s time for a change. Here’s what’s been on my mind:

1. No Career Growth: I’ve learned a lot about the industry and feel like I’m doing well in my role, but there’s no clear path forward. Most of my learning is self-driven or through school, which is fine, and my company does offer free certifications and resources. But I feel stuck doing the same thing every month. I’ve tried suggesting ways to improve our reports and make them better, but those ideas usually get shot down. My team has to follow another team’s report format, which, to be honest, isn’t great it’s often inaccurate and needs to be approved by higher-ups.
2. Overworked: Mid-2024, a coworker on my team moved to another department, and I ended up taking on *all* their responsibilities in addition to my own. No raise, no promotion, just more work. At first, I was annoyed but tried to roll with it. Now, I’m just burned out. On top of that, there are constant changes to some of the reports, which makes it even harder to keep up.
3. Company Cutbacks: My company’s been cutting costs for financial reasons, which doesn’t feel great in terms of stability or future opportunities like open roles for horizontal movement.
4. Overqualified: I have two graduate degrees (one in Analytics), and they both align with my career goals. I’m really more interested in moving into a data scientist role, but I feel like I’m stuck in this analyst position currently, and there seems to be no path towards a data scientist role.

Here’s What I’m Worried About:

1. Timing: With the holidays around the corner and new leadership coming in, is this the worst possible time to be job hunting?
2. Job Market: The market feels really unpredictable right now, and I’m not sure if that makes finding a new role harder or riskier. What resources helps track industry quality when looking for a new job?

There are likely other concerns on my mind, but these are the main ones weighing on me right now. I’d really appreciate any advice, thank you!",23,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1gwk1jx/is_now_the_right_time_to_switch_jobs_given_the/,1732208223.0,ImpossibleSans,1gwk1jx,advice_seeking
careerguidance,constantly overworked,Can I get some honest career guidance?,"I'm in high school right now and I'm currently freaking out.  I have multiple planned courses to take when I graduate, I try doing side hobbies that earn money, but I also want to maintain my own happiness within a job  I think I'm working hard, I got a decent job for a high-schooler, but what I'm really concerned about is my future.  I have planned courses for IT management fields, Medical Practitioner fields, Aerospace Fields, and some side hobbies I do for money such as reffing, tutoring, and photography.  What really concerns me is if the choice I make will be the right one for the future.  

There are so many choices, and I feel like if I choose the wrong one, I will mess up in life.  I'm constantly stressed about the future and what plans I should make, doubting myself whether I should choose this kind of career, or the other for different reasons entirely.  I would like advice from the people that read this.    


1. Are you happy with the choices that you made?  

Obviously having a career that you're satisfactory with is something that is important.  A job that is too straining on your mental health takes more out of your body than the money that flows in your wallet.  Do you have advice on any of the choices that you made to end up where you are now, happy and satisfied?

  
2. What salary are you yourself satisfied with?

Living costs are different for everyone, but I want to find that sweet spot.  Everyone lives differently but I'm not looking for a super duper rich salary that pays amazingly well, but a salary that I can be satisfied with, knowing that the choices I made were definitely worth it.

  
3. What are the typical work hours that you find yourself dealing with?  
Dealing with work is one thing, but I would like to know how long and hard you work.  I can overwork myself sometimes, thinking that I'm underworking, but in the end, its different for everyone, so I'm curious about the number of hours that you work with what you do.

4. (Last one I promise)  What path did you take to get the career you have now? 

There are multiple factors into multiple careers, and if your content with the careers you have, then would you mind telling me what paths you took to get there?  It may or may not convince me whether or not the choices I'm making are going into the right directions, but it'll give me something.

  
Thank you for reading this, and please be completely honest.

careerguidance,constantly overworked,Is It Okay to Leave a New Job After Just Two Days if It Feels Like a Bad Fit?,"Background: i am 22 and I recently graduated with a degree in marketing and moved to a new city. 

With the job market being bad, I decided to accept the first job that came to me. I recently started a new administrative assistant job at a small organization, and after just two days, I'm feeling really unhappy. This is a non profit for elderly woman so everything is very very old school. I only have 3 other co workers trying to run this place, who are much older than me. There’s been no training, I don’t know what I’m doing, I feel isolated, and the work environment is uncomfortable. Everything is old and very disorganized with junk in all the drawers and cabinet. My boss doesn't seem invested in my success or well-being. She is the director so she is constantly in meetings with only a couple minutes to check in on me. The employees who currently work there seem overworked and say how they would not want to be doing my job. And I’m pretty sure one of them today was trying to hide that she had fleas on her feet from the house. I’m starting to get a bad gut feeling about this job, but I know how the job market is right now. 

Well I did get an email two weeks ago for an initial screening interview for a marketing role that I was excited about, but I declined because I had just accepted this job. This job was literally my dream first job and I feel like an idiot and guilty for not doing an interview, but I didn’t know how bad this job was going to be. Also the marketing job is a full time salary, while my administrative job is around 35-40 hours but I am an hourly worker so I get no benefits. Should I reach out and ask if they’re still doing interviews for the marketing position, or should I stick it out in my current role? I plan on talking to my boss and let her know my issues but since it’s a small non profit, I don’t have much hope for things to get fixed. 

Edit: adding some more info that I keep remembering the more I think about my experience so far! 

UPDATE: thank you all for the advice! Today I talked to my boss and my main concern was just making sure I can grow my some of my skills here. I have had multiple jobs previously related to marketing so I was getting stressed that taking an admin assistant job would be hurtful to my career. I know I’m 22, but I already stress about everything about not having a career especially in the current state of everything. I also reached back out to the other job because it was a great opportunity, so hopefully I will hear back. So I will not quit, because a job is money which I need, but I will definitely be applying to other jobs.

careerguidance,constantly overworked,Just left my first job. Unsure how to move on?,"Hey everybody. Hopefully this is a good place to share this, but I (F17) just had my last day at my first ever job at a med retail store in my area. I won't share the exact name of the company just bc I'm paranoid about people in my real life knowing anything of my online existence, but those who know will know. I started there as a seasonal worker for the holidays, their first seasonal hire in late august. I was super excited to be working and making my own money, and during the holidays it was great! I worked hard and often and got close with many other associates. It also brought me closer to my older cousin and his gf who both worked there as well. I became pretty engrossed in my work life once I got comfortable there, friends even jokingly referring to me as ""(store) girl"". I was quickly picked up for part time after the seasonal period ended, and my store manager gloated that I was his first hire after he came to our store when I performed well. Now for the shittier parts of the job...

Firstly, management could be difficult. There was a rotating list of supervisors/managers in the period I worked there, some leaving from reasons ranging from medical reasons to serious allegations. I got along fairly well with most of them, and I did my best to play up the ""young girl earnest to work hard for her first job"" shtick. Not that it wasn't true, but it kept me from receiving the harsher treatment some of my coworkers endured. Mainly I just tried to be nice and helpful. Thing is, my store is realllyyy pushy about getting people to sign up for our credit card. Like borderline unethical. I was vaguely aware of this going in, but had no idea just how serious it was. Like my job was basically credit card salesman disguised as cashier/customer service. I performed ok, definitely stronger than most of the others my age I worked with, outdid mostly by seasoned employees. Though, I frequently dealt with management literally breathing down my neck to make sure I was getting my numbers up. They even set up a ""board of shame"" with loyalty cards of those underperforming. My store manager had me stay late one night, and I expressed to him that I was not getting many hours at the time, to which he told me that it would change only if my numbers were higher. (complete bs. they just cut payroll at the time)

This became really stressful to deal with, they even pit employees against each other with gifts as motivation. Our store manager, likely to delegate the bad guy responsibility onto someone else, made it the job of who (at the time) was one of my favorite supervisors to make sure we were getting credits. She even got written up when we underperformed. She quickly became really visibly stressed and uptight and way less honest and relaxed around us, though admitted often that she was overwhelmed at work.

Then came scheduling issues. The woman who schedules us is a complete and utter idiot and asshole who does little but talk shit and take 20 smoke breaks a day. She snapped at me once for trying to speak with her when she wasn't working (I didn't know, apologized immediately) and was very unreceptive to our schedule changes. Crazy part is, the computer does most of the work for her. She was unwilling to change my availability to end earlier in the night (reasons out of my control) but jumped at the opportunity to schedule me almost every day in a week as soon as I got out of school. She frequently called to ask me to pick up shifts while I was in class, despite my protests, and even put me in for 3pm when I explicitly stated I couldn't work before 4 on weekdays. I avoided her like the plague when I could.

Time came where I took off the wrong day for a very important event mistakenly and realized I had enough sick time to use to cover the 8 hr shift. I put it in on the app and called it a day. She called 2 days later while I was in school. Twice. I emailed her to no response, but refused to call back after having a hard day. My request for sick time was cancelled. She told me during my next shift that the company did not allow sick time to be taken early and I'd use it after calling out. Fine. But then she began to press about it. I lied, telling her I had an appointment with my doctor. ""And you need the full day off for that?"" She complained about being short-staffed that day, which ultimately wasn't my problem. I worked enough hours I had 19 hrs of sick time to use. I was using it. The same day I tried to take my half hour break that I am owed as a minor when working 5+ hrs in my state. Supervisor from before told me that I wasn't scheduled to have one. I timidly asked that she check again, citing local law, but she just had me take a 15 instead. I did. i also took pictures of the papers in the break room citing the break guidelines for minors, but it was already a stressful, understaffed day where my super already acted snippy towards us and I was too nervous to bring it up again. I went home exhausted after only 5 hrs of work. (not the first time i was not given a break on schedule btw)

It was then that I realized how miserable work was making me lately. I left feeling tired and frustrated every day. It often kept me from seeing friends and family because when I wasn't working, I was in a shitty mood or just too tired to engage in much outside of it. I missed being able to have real time to myself, especially as summer began. I missed not having to bully old people into signing up for a credit card they don't want and dealing with constant theft that brought police around daily. Biggest factor of all was seeing the rest of my coworkers down in the dumps as well. My cousin HATED it there and frequently advised me to leave. Another supervisor cited our collective exhaust one night as coming from ""this place"". Everyone felt shitty at and after work. It didn't help that we dealt with the constant impending doom of our corporate failures and verbal abuse from customers. Coworkers were what made me stay and care about the job in the first place. It wasn't even just the girls my age I could chat with, it was the tough older woman who worked there for years and helped whenever I needed, it was the sweet motherly figure who introduced me to her real daughter with excitement. It was the woman who I could talk about my family with since her baby daddy was so similar to my own father. I really enjoyed these people. They were comfortable and familiar. The place was familiar, even in my misery I knew what to do, how to do it. It was a way my adhd riddled ass could hyperfixate on something actually productive.

But my plan was never to work in retail my whole life. I want to be a lawyer, and despite this terrible midnight rant, I think of myself as fairly well spoken and intelligent. I get nearly straight As in school (minus math where I barely missed an a and gym which I despise) and am involved in clubs and volunteer work. I am excited to begin taking classes with my local community college as I begin senior year!! Logically, I had to let go of this job around them anyway. There was no possible way for me to keep up with work with everything else on my plate. I want to enjoy the time I had with fam and friends this summer while I still have it. So I decided not long after my cousin left for another job, two put my own two weeks in (citing my upcoming lack of availability). At first, it was relief. I was quickly approached by many expressing their sadness at my leave, and I assured them that I would still come around to shop and visit. The last two weeks were wonderful. I performed really well and became way more relaxed about my work since I was leaving anyway. I used the rest of my sick hours too, much to that bitch's chagrin. Part of me almost regretted my decision, but I made my bed, and I knew it was best to lay in it. My last day was filled with hugs and goodbyes from coworkers and even some supervisors. I left feeling good, but a good part of my heart mourned the loss of what had become such a constant in my life, people, knowledge that became ultimately unimportant. I put a lot of work in and obviously made money but almost felt like it was for nothing. I'm happy that I left and am excited to move on to the next chapter in my life, but my sentimentality and fear of change urges me to go back despite everything that lead me to leave in the first place.

I even came back to visit today. It wasn't my idea, I was out with a friend who suggested it, but I jumped at the opportunity. It was filled with slightly awkward waves and smiles and I realized that I needed to let go. I was not about to be the weird girl who comes and hangs out at her old place of employment in her free time. I want to move on but its almost like its hardwired into my brain at this point. I feel a little crazy right now. If anyone has any suggestions or similar experiences, please share. I feel weirdly alone in this. Apologies for any errors.

TLDR  
17F just left my first job at a retail store after nearly a year. Started off loving it as a seasonal worker, bonded with coworkers, and got promoted to part-time. But over time, things got toxic: constant pressure to push credit cards, bad management, unfair scheduling, and stress from being overworked without proper breaks. Despite caring about my coworkers and being sentimental about the place, I realized the job was draining me and interfering with school, friends, and my future goals. I put in my two weeks and left on good terms, but still feel weirdly attached and nostalgic. Now I'm trying to move on but feel conflicted and a little lost.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1ltlixk/just_left_my_first_job_unsure_how_to_move_on/,1751864278.0,shiftyy1712,1ltlixk,advice_seeking
careerguidance,constantly overworked,Burnt out and overwhelmed—should I still quit my job without another lined up?,"I’m in a tough spot and hoping to get some outside perspective.

I currently work in marketing at a well-respected company with lots of growth opportunities and industry exposure. I recently submitted my two weeks’ notice after hitting a wall with burnout, but my boss asked me to take some time off and think it through before making it final.

Here’s my situation:
I’ve been working 10–12 hour days, weekends, and even holidays for the past few weeks.

I’m salaried and don’t get paid OT, but just found out a coworker does—and has been getting significantly compensated for extra hours.

My salary is relatively low, and with the hours I work, I’m earning below minimum wage per hour.

I’ve had daily breakdowns from the stress and workload. Even when I’m off the clock, I’m thinking about work or feeling guilty for not working.

I no longer have time or energy for hobbies or rest. My entire life revolves around work, and all I talk about with friends is work.

My manager is a micromanager and dismissive when I bring up burnout or boundaries. When I asked about a raise, he rolled his eyes and said he didn’t know. They also constantly goes above and beyond for clients, often at the expense of the team’s time—pushing us to work late and sacrifice our own boundaries to meet unrealistic expectations.

PTO is a battle to get approved, and the culture encourages overworking and glorifies “going above and beyond.”

My boss is asking me to stay, saying that work-life balance can be improved and everything is solvable. He warned me that leaving without a backup plan is risky and that re-entering the job market could be stressful.

The company does have strong industry standing, and I’ve learned a lot here. There’s a chance things could get better if changes are actually made. But at this point, it’s starting to feel like a toxic relationship—I keep hoping it will get better, but nothing really changes. The pattern of overwork and burnout has been consistent since I started. I feel stuck between:
	•Staying and risking continued burnout, but possibly growing my career
	•Leaving to protect my mental health and take a break—but with no safety net or job lined up

If I choose to renegotiate and end up staying, I worry my toxic coworkers might treat me even worse for not following through with my resignation.

If anyone has been through something similar, or has thoughts on how to navigate this, I’d really appreciate your advice. I’m feeling lost and unsure of what’s the “right” move here.",9,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1la34op/burnt_out_and_overwhelmedshould_i_still_quit_my/,1749776401.0,Exomsj,1la34op,advice_seeking
careerguidance,constantly overworked,"Do I suffer in the name of making more money, or do I take a pay hit to find a better ladder to climb?","I'm a 26 year old male living in the Midwest.

I'm currently working as a (non-union) traveling millwright apprentice/laborer, and I am feeling very stuck. Long read here, I apologize in advance.

I work on 10 day stretches, I've never done work like this before, and 9/10 of journeymen on the job site don't speak English, so if there's nobody bilingual and free to work with me, I end up just helping out where I can and picking up trash and other grunt work. I'm not faulting the guys not speaking the same language as I, but when the foreman and other millwrights are discussing a plan and trying to come up with solutions, I'm not in the loop so I'm playing catch up once we get rolling. The language barrier has been a challenging hurdle, and I think it impedes my growth in this trade as well. I'm not expected to be a ""skilled"" laborer at this point, but even after a year it sometimes feels like I have made no progress in my abilities. The millwright trade with this contractor has you doing something different every day, so I have gotten better at what I do, but it feels only sparingly. 

(aside from residential flooring remodels, and the only skill I've learned from there that applies here is reading a measuring tape)

How I ended up here:

I have no college degree.

School wasn't convenient for me after high school due to me being a degenerate teenager and being kicked out of my parents house and having to figure it out. I completed two college courses but dropped out after a semester.

I sold insurance for two years and did well, but 22 year old me wanted more than phone calls and being cooped up in an office, so I left the insurance industry to sell residential flooring in a retail setting. I thought that I would get more fulfillment out of a more in-person role, but it wasn't easy being a young (non homeowner) selling a product I hadn't actually experienced myself.

I did *okay* at it, but I was just staying afloat and not really thriving in that setting, so I quit after about two years.

Eventually a staff agency recruiter saw my resume on Indeed and set me up on a temporary 12 month contract. (not temp to hire, I was told in the interview being hired as a full time employee was unlikely)
This role was a field project coordinator position for a large industrial project. I received and organized inventory, took meeting notes, progress photography and pictures, job site maintenance, (moving snow, filling in ruts, sweeping the concrete, putting up safety barricades/red tape, cleaned up trash), responded to RFIs, talked to superintendents and foremen every day to see if there was anything they needed that I could help with, etc. It was a role that required me to learn and do a lot, but I enjoyed it because my people skills and previous experience dealing with people and customers was used on the job site, so I didn't feel COMPLETELY lost, and I was able to adapt. After my contract ended I was looking for work, and I could've worked as an operator the plant we built, but my ex girlfriend at the time was moving out of the Midwest and didn't want me to take that job and I thought I would only do this until I found something in the same city as her. We split up shortly after I took this job anyways.

(I made the mistake of love over career, please spare me the grief, I know how stupid it was.)

Out of all of the other subcontractors on site the millwright trade seemed the most interesting, I had the best working relationship with their superintendent, and they offered the most money. I didn't have to work with them, but the thought of entering job search mode once again sounded exhausting so I took it. 

Unfortunately the taste of construction management I got has made me think that I'm capable of doing more, but the current job market tells me I'm under qualified for anything resembling that placement. 

I make $28 an hour right now which is significantly better than entry level jobs in the state I live in, but I'm miserable being away from home all the time. 

I don't want to keep traveling on these long stretches doing manual labor, but I also don't want to worry about making commission either. 

I understand that I will probably take a pay cut, and that's okay, but I also don't want to be struggling and that's the only reason I've stayed where I'm at for so long. 

I somewhat enjoy learning how to work with my hands, but it's not something I want to do forever. I don't like the blue collar culture of drinking, bragging about how overworked you are, hating your family/SO, and the constant job site dick measuring everyone's doing. 

I want to search for another job, but going through LinkedIn and Indeed feels hopeless, as the times I've applied to 100+ jobs (with cover letters) with matching qualifications and I've heard almost nothing back even after following up. I've had two interviews in the past year, one rejected me, the second interview I was contacted by a recruiter via LinkedIn, and I got to the final interview, but they went with another candidate. 
I've touched up my resume several times, but I fear that I just lack any valuable experience at all. 

I understand my resume shows that I have a track record of lack of long term commitment, while true, I know that if I found something that made me feel fulfilled and paid the bills, I would be content and not search elsewhere. I don't list the insurance experience anymore, nor do I disclose it in interviews due to the fact I'm not really looking for sales roles anymore.

I am torn between accepting where I'm at, and trying to find somewhere to work that has an actual ladder to climb, as the next step up is foreman, and the company I'm with doesn't really provide alternative paths. The best I could get out of this job is a journeyman's certification, but I just signed up for classes this fall. I don't know if I have four years of this left in me.

I'm sorry for rambling on but I wanted the Reddit experts to have full context. 

I know it's not too late for me to turn my life around, but I just don't know to do it realistically.

Should I tell white lies on my resume to get called for interviews?

Do I stay where I'm at and hate my life?

Do I continue to spend my very limited free time after work writing cover letters for hiring managers that don't even get past my resume?

Do I go back to school and pursue a degree online while working full time? 

I am so tired, I am so lost. Looking for advice, also kind of wanted to vent a little.

TLDR: I am in a traveling labor position that I hate. I want to escape, but I don't know if there's anything I'm qualified for so I'm rooting in it for now, but I don't want to root in it too long.",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1lw2i1t/do_i_suffer_in_the_name_of_making_more_money_or/,1752117777.0,Broke_Boy_James,1lw2i1t,advice_seeking
careerguidance,constantly overworked,How to deal with uncertainty of life ?,"i’ve always struggled with anxiety
during covid and online college it got worse
i remember moments where i used to shiver and my breathing would speed up
it got better after a while when i started going out and met new people
but when i joined my first job as a graphic designer it came back
i left that job within a few weeks — not just because of anxiety but because i felt unprepared
i didn’t have a proper setup, just did a short course from a local place and jumped in, thinking i was ready
but i wasn’t

after that i took a break
then due to financial pressure i took the first job i found — as a telecaller
i didn’t even know it was a sales job until 2 months in
that job came with a lot of issues — office politics, overwork, unreasonable expectations — but i didn’t face anxiety the way i used to
in fact, i felt like i was doing well
i was praised, people saw me as a leader, and even though i hated the sales part, i enjoyed the rest of the work
it felt like i had finally figured things out and beaten my anxiety

then i switched jobs
at first everything seemed fine — i was finally entering the HR field, had a clear plan to grow in it, and side by side focus on my creative goals like my handmade gifts business and digital art
but things started falling apart again

this new job as an HR recruiter has daily targets
it’s fast-paced, way more than what i’ve ever done
and suddenly the performance anxiety kicked in
i started doubting myself again, overthinking, regretting decisions
i felt that same old anxiety crawling back

the worst part is — i can’t leave this job right now because of financial reasons
i’ve done difficult jobs before, and i know i can keep going
but this time the pressure of not performing is breaking me
every day i feel like i’m not good enough
and now i cry almost daily, sometimes multiple times a day
and it hurts to feel like i’m back to square one
My anxiety is worsening because now my whole body shivers, I also fainted a few days back and felt like I kinda had a panic attack the other day.

it feels like i’m constantly running away.. that i can’t stick to one thing, or one career
and i hate this loop
uncertain about the future, struggling financially, doubting myself, yet still pushing through each day hoping for something to change

I'm not sure what I like where I'm heading in life and what I'm supposed to do
I've reached out to each person in my life who's opinions matter to me and who's guidance can lead me through this and they have all been supportive of my confusion saying this is life and it happens and you should take some time out think analyse and then take a step accordingly.

But guess what I chose Graphic designing and yet I'm messed up
I chose HR and yet I'm confused and stuck

I've taken decisions and that has lead to doubts and regrets
So now I fear taking decisions

Honestly this is just a vent out post if anyone has a solution suggestion or anything to make this any better please share

careerguidance,constantly overworked,How to Pivot from B.A. in Linguistics?,"Hi everyone, this is gonna be a long one 😂 But a big thank you to anyone who is willing to help. I made a similar post a few weeks ago and got plenty of helpful advice and suggestions, really appreciate everyone's thoughtful responses, I've since been exploring new career paths and evaluating my options. 



# Short Background

I got a B.A. in English Linguistics, planned on identifying linguistics-adjacent Masters programs in Germany/France but unfortunately due to bad timing, just missed the deadlines for this year. In addition to B.A. Linguistics, I also have partial degrees in statistics and biology that I chose not to finish.

I received a 4-year full Bachelor scholarship, though only used 3 years. So I was fortunately able to reenroll for this upcoming Fall 2025 semester. I'm not sure if I will do one semester or two, but both options would be at no cost. I want to decide what field I should pivot into, and what education/coursework I should do this year to help me get there. I'm not necessarily looking to get another Bachelor's entirely, as some potential Masters paths only require SOME technical coursework to qualify for. I should say also, I am a dual U.S./Canada citizen, so pursuing work/education there is entirely an option.



# What I Want From a Job

I should share what I want from a job/career path. I've traveled the world nomadically for the last 4 years, so job portability is a big deal for me. Not necessarily traveling constantly for work, but having a career with transferable skills that allows for job hopping once every 1-2 years. I'd like to get residency in the EU eventually, though this will take time. I have lived/worked in East Africa for many years and like the lifestyle there, would like a career that allows me to stay there for a few years. Since I've become very accustomed to a lower standard of living, salary is not immediately very high on my list of priorities. Even 40-50k starting in the West (or 20k-30k in East Africa) is fine for me. I also want to consider factors like AI-proof and offshoring-proof. I'll leave the debate and fear-mongering about AI apocalypse aside, I just want to gain skills/experience in a relevant field that won't be obsolete soon. 

Here are the general areas of interest, as well as my personal thoughts on different factors like employability, portability, automation/offshoring, etc. Let me know your thoughts and if there's a Masters program / career track that I haven't considered still, let me know and why. Many many thanks.



# 1) Computational Linguistics / NLP

Summary:  
\- Take 1-2 semesters of computer science coursework, linear algebra, etc.  
\- I'm also doing a Python bootcamp online (but I'm aware that they mean next to nothing in terms of certification, but I just need to learn fast and now)   
\- Apply for MSc in Computational Linguistics

My prior stats courses would help, as well as linguistics courses that focused on computational methods, tokenizers, data analysis. I see many programs in Germany and Canada that accept Linguistics undergrads with extra technical experience. I'm well aware of the recent layoffs in tech and over-saturation of CS and DS undergrads. I've also been told by many people that this might be a path that requires a PhD to be relevant in the research/design of these models. I'm also aware of the rise of LLMs that utilize less traditional NLP methods, though also their setbacks which still make traditional NLP applications needed (LLMs being energy-intensive, not as robust with multilingual models, etc.). In terms of portability, I feel like my portfolio and experience would shine, and it could be easier to move internationally with my skillset. East Africa has a budding tech startup scene in Nairobi, though it's still quite small and pay is low (and rising political instability). EU has good German tech industry, but it would still be hard landing a work visa, possibly if I land some connections if I go get Masters there (MSc Computational Linguistics @ Stuttgart). What stresses me out slightly is that tech jobs require you to be on your game constantly, learning new technology/applications, and constantly upskilling to stay relevant. Pay potential is  higher in tech than my other options, even though salary is not my first priority, and job-hopping might actually be in my favor.



# 2) Neurolinguistics / Language Acquisition Research

Summary:  
\- Take 1-2 semesters additional coursework in neuroscience, etc.  
\- Apply for MSc in Cognitive Science  
\- OR accept current offer MSc Cognitive Science from Osnabrück

I have a very deep interest in language acquisition and I believe my strongest asset is the fact that I speak 5-8 languages in varying levels of fluency. It has been my entire education, professional experience, driving force, so I would enjoy a career that utilizes my specialty. Though, I'm worried about the job prospects, especially in academia. I'm not sure if medical research roles that aren't in direct applications (nursing, etc.) will be as AI-resistant, but I confess I don't know too much about whether it will be threatened over time. If I manage to get a Masters + PhD in the EU, I feel my chances would be better to get visa (work/post-student/etc.) but I'm not too sure how this field would intersect with the East African market. While I'm fine with making less money, I really wanna avoid being unemployed for many months while struggling to find a job, and the entire job market can seem like that nowadays. So it's definitely a worry with any kind of research-level careers, even in the medical sector. I was accepted into the University of Osnabrück for MSc in Cognitive Science this year but not sure if I should take it. I'm just worried that the Masters would be a ""nothing degree"" and wouldn't prepare me with enough hard skills to find a job after university. Also worried if I'd be making a mistake entering that field instead of tech or applied healthcare. The alternative to accepting that is that I return and take 1-2 semesters of neuroscience and psychology courses and apply for ""better"" universities in DE/FR like **University of Trento**, **Max Planck School of Cognition**, Cog-SUP at Sorbonne and Paris-Cité.



# 3) Applied Healthcare (various)

Summary:  
\- Taking 1-2 semesters additional coursework in anatomy&physiology, psychology, or child language development depending on the exact track  
\- For *nursing*: Attending another 1 year accelerated BSc Nursing  
\- For *others*: applying for MSc Clinical Psychology or MSc Speech Language Pathology.

Changing gears here. I'm exploring Speech Language Pathology / Nurse Practitioner / Mental Health Practice. I would feel better than I'm investing in skills that are particularly automation-resistant, also that these health skills are valued around the world and will grow in relevance with an aging population. It would be significantly more difficult to travel around, as health practice is protected by all these licensures and registrations (which yea, makes it quite AI-resistant 👍🏼). 

For s**peech language pathology (SLP)**, I did find the license reciprocity between U.S./Canada/NZ/Australia/Ireland/UK very promising, though it would be harder to break into EU with licensing issues. If I manage to, I think it would be easier to get a work visa since there's a shortage of SLPs there too. East Africa might be more difficult since they need more general health and mental health professionals, though I've heard that there's still a market for SLPs among international communities and around military bases. In terms of scalability, I don't think there's much potential to grow salaries with time, which could present an issue. I think growth potential would only come from opening my own private practice, which would effectively prevent me from traveling. The upsides is I think it would be great, human-centered, interpersonal work, and I wouldn't encounter as many Type A, impersonal personalities like in tech. There's obviously downsides to the field from what I've heard: endless paperwork, some parents/school boards are nightmares. But it seems like a generally lower-paying, but very stable job: you get your education and license and you just do that for the rest of your life, not as much constant upskilling. I am worried about the recent dismantling of Medicaid and how that would affect the field, though I don't really plan on living/working in U.S. so I don't know how much that affects the world/job competitiveness. I'll see what happens for now.

For g**eneral nursing**, it would require significant education pivot, but I've calculated that taking one full year of major pre-requisites, when combined with my prior biology classes, would then allow me to enroll in a one-year accelerated BSN afterwards. So two years total. But major issues I see: transferring nursing degrees to EU sounds like literal hell, and I see that the role of a ""nurse practitioner"" is not really a part of their healthcare system, so it's very lengthy and may involve starting from square one again. Also that the roles ""nurses"" take in the EU are severely underpaid and overworked. On the other hand, I feel that finding work in East Africa would be a piece of cake. The job itself would obviously be very stressful and draining, but finding the opportunities (e.g. MSF) would be straightforward due to a constant need.

  
For **mental health** practice, haven't looked into it as much as the others, but I'd worry for the same reasons of license barriers, low scalability over time, etc. I think it would be high interpersonal, human-centered work, and I believe my strongest skills are soft skills in communication and people skills, as well as my multilingualism and very extensive international experience. But mental health work isn't a cake walk by any means, and I understand that it's often stressful and there's a long path of rather shitty jobs in underfunded psychiatric wards until you can establish your own practice, at least for the US, not sure how it is in the EU yet.



# 4) UX Design / Human Computer Interaction

Summary:  
\- if things don't work out, pursuing a MSc in HCI or UX Design  
\- learning the technical skills, building a strong portfolio, starting small with projects/internships/etc.

This isn't immediately my deep interest, but I just hear a lot that this field will see lots of demand in the future, and that the design portion is still difficult to be fully automated. I should say this first off: I totally acknowledge it's not just a matter of learning Figma and making a portfolio. I see some people talking about this job like it's an easy breakthrough and only requires moderate upskilling, but also heard from more landed UX designers that it takes good niche skills, a robust portfolio, and dedication to the field beyond just chasing a paycheck. This path would be rather friendly to traveling/remote work I feel. I would try for a Masters in HCI or UX Design, though I hear that Masters degrees in this field are not as important as attestable experience/portfolio/etc. Ultimately this is more of a backup if things don't work out, not my first choice.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1lqvnsf/how_to_pivot_from_ba_in_linguistics/,1751564038.0,Puzzleheaded_Act3968,1lqvnsf,advice_seeking
careerguidance,don't know what to do with my life,Is it normal to do basically nothing at your corporate job?,"Six months ago, I was hired as a data analyst at a large insurance company after finishing my master's program. The interview process was thorough—a technical assessment where I had to clean messy data and build visualizations, a case study presentation, and a couple rounds of behavioral interviews with some SQL questions thrown in. Nothing too extreme, but enough to make me think this would be a challenging role.

Now I'm here with a 6 figure salary and benefits in a hybrid role (2 days in office, 3 remote), but I spend most days with surprisingly little to do. My first project was cleaning up our customer dataset and building some marketing dashboards. I worked efficiently, finished ahead of schedule, and my manager was genuinely impressed with the results.

But since completing that project three months ago, I've had minimal work. I occasionally get requests for data pulls or simple visualizations that take maybe 30 minutes. I've started using some basic tools and approaches that just seemed logical to me.

I built a few reusable templates in our BI tool that I can modify for different requests. The marketing director called me a ""visualization genius"" in a meeting because I used a different chart type than the pie charts they've apparently been using since 2003.

The marketing team thinks I'm working overtime because I schedule emails with their requested reports to send at 6:30am. In reality, I finished them at 2pm the day before and spent the rest of the afternoon watching YouTube videos about beer brewing.

I mostly use Chatgpt to help write my SQL queries. My 58-year-old manager walked by my desk last week, saw some basic subqueries on my screen and said, ""Wow, you young folks really understand this database stuff intuitively."" Sir, I literally just asked an AI to write this for me.

I wrote a small Python script to help the sales team consolidate their weekly reports (honestly, I just described the problem to Chatgpt and tweaked the code it gave me). We literally covered this exact task in my data processing course, but they acted like I'd invented electricity. The sales director wanted to know my ""secret"" to solving their problem so quickly. My secret is that I'm not using Excel formulas for everything like it's 1998.

For weekly department meetings or any other meeting with way too many people in it I use an ai note taker (yapnote) so I don't have to pay attention during call. When someone asked about a detail from last month's meeting, I just asked ai about it topic while everyone was still debating what was said. Do people not know that you can do this??

I genuinely work maybe 10-15 hours a week. The rest of the time I'm just... waiting. Reading wait but why posts. Watching woodworking videos. I even started baking bread smh. Organizing my desktop folders by color (don't judge me, we all have our ways of maintaining sanity).

Is this what corporate America is actually like? In school, professors warned us about the ""demanding corporate environment"" and ""high-pressure deadlines."" My biggest pressure right now is pretending to look busy when my camera is on during team calls.

Last week, I got called into an unexpected meeting with my manager. I was convinced they'd figured out I wasn't doing much. Instead, he asked if I'd be willing to help other team members ""level up their technical skills."" I'm not even sure what skills I'm supposed to be sharing—using the search function? Knowing how to clear the cache? How to ask Chatgpt?

Is this normal? Did I accidentally hack corporate life? Or am I missing something fundamental about how work is supposed to function? I feel like I'm in some weird corporate twilight zone where perception completely disconnects from reality.",5084,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1jjkxnc/is_it_normal_to_do_basically_nothing_at_your/,1742913632.0,Cold-Cauliflower9741,1jjkxnc,advice_seeking

careerguidance,don't know what to do with my life,"Went back to school at 27, became an engineer at 31 and a year and a half later, I already hate it. What should I do?","Hi everyone,

This one is a bit of a rant, but since that idea is pretty much obsessing me, I thought I'd share it and I'd welcome your insight.

I'm a 32 yo male from Canada. In my 20s, I did a worthless undergraduate degree and kept an unrelated job that paid barely over the minimum wage. At around 27, my girlfriend became pregnant and I knew I had to increase my income somehow. I always had an interest in science and mathematics (among other things), so I decided to go back to college to earn a second undergraduate degree that would land me a more lucrative job, this time in a lucrative engineering field.

Fast-forward 4 years, I graduated and landed a first job in civil engineering (a different field than the one I studied in). The place ended up being as toxic as it gets, so I switched job once more, only to end up in a similar, toxic work environment. I lasted 6 months in each job.

I have had a new job for, once again, 6 months, and this time, I have a pretty nice team, a good boss, and there's nothing toxic about this job at all. Great, right? The job is boring, but at first I though I could live with it. The pay is reasonable, and my standards of living clearly improved.

That being said, I hate it. I'm curious by nature and I love learning new things. However, right now, I couldn't care less. I'm not good at my job, which isn't surprising since I just started, but still. Despite my best efforts, my energy has been dropping steadily, and I'm doing less and less work everyday. I'm at entry-level, so I know that I will receive more and more responsibilities as time goes by, and I don't want it, even if it comes with an increase in my income. I could live with my actual income in the long run.

I've been fantasizing about going back to school again, but my family cannot afford it as I'm the main provider, so I need to keep working. Also, I'm in my 30s and I've switched fields quite a lot, so there's a part of me that believes that switching once more would be a loser's move. That being said, I hate the office environment, and I feel that my professional life is not only stagnating, but that I'm going downhill and cannot find the will to motivate myself.

Am I supposed to keep going for the next 30 years? I don't believe that the job environment is the issue this time. **I am the issue**. I'm good at maths, science and at all things academic in general, but I suck at engineering, somehow.

Reddit, please share your wisdom with me. Am I missing something?

  
EDIT: My post gained a lot of traction. Thank you everyone for your answers. I think I'll try to use my degree and the experience I'm currently gaining to eventually pivot to something else. Nothing hasty, but I'll just keep that in mind for the long run.

I question this a lot in my life because I have not gotten results since I graduated back in 2023. I graduated with an aerospace-related degree (Not Engineering, but related STEM topics). I feel getting a master's degree is a mistake I did? I do want to go back to university for Engineering, but I am having financial Issues.

I don't feel happy I graduated with a master's degree. I feel like having a Master's degree is a curse rather than a celebration. I feel upset since I've been applying like crazy to the NASA contractors for these Aerospace/ Defense Programs, and all I keep getting rejection letters. There were some that I got interviews with over the past two years, but then nothing has happened. I have gone to career fairs like crazy in my field of studies, handed resumes, and recently started business cards. Even sent thank you letters after an interview, and got rejection letters the next day, so fast. It's messed up when they do this.

I feel it's a mistake that I got a master's degree, thinking to myself it makes it an advantage, but rather a curse.

careerguidance,career change at 30/40,More money but long commute - what would you do?,"So, I've found myself in an interesting position - and I'm not sure what I should do. I'm in my mid-30's, spouse works at home, one toddler in daycare - in case any of that is helpful context.

Option One - stay in my current role. 

* I'm currently in a senior individual contributor role. I've essentially been doing the same job for a few years now, but I have just been moved onto a team where I have the opportunity to learn a valuable, in-demand skillset that's hard to gain experience in. That being said, even if I gain this experience, the only way I am advancing internally at this point is if someone leaves the company. I've been here for 10 years.
* I work from home. My job truly only requires about 20 hours of active work per week. I have incredible flexibility. We have unlimited time off and I end up taking 20-30 days off each year in addition to 10 company holidays. I can easily step away from my work to take my kid to a doctor's appointment, drop the car off for an oil change, run the dogs to the vet. Nobody bats an eye. 
* Base salary is $110 with a 15% bonus, which never pays out at 100%. Raises have been pretty small over the last few years. 
* I do have some equity. No timeline on a transaction, but when we sell, I will get anywhere form $5,000 to $40,000, depending on our valuation at that time. 

Option two - take the new job.

* New job would be a big change. Managing a small team of \~5 people and leading a functional area that I do have experience in but am not an expert in. It would be a great growth opportunity and a good next step for my career.
* Pay is great - $145 base with 20% bonus that pays out at 125% historically. Standard benefits, accrued vacation (starting at 15 days a year). 
* The biggest concern? This would be in-office three days a week. The commute would be brutal - 1 hour each way on a good day, but likely closer to 2 hours each way. 

I would only accept the job if I could negotiate the in-office time down to 1 or 2 days a week, but even then - is it the right choice? I'm so torn.

careerguidance,career change at 30/40,How do I deal with a passive-aggressive manager that I no longer work for?,"About a year ago I (22f) received a promotion at my job. My new manager at the time  (40-ish m, let’s call him Brad) was also promoted at roughly the same time I was promoted. Brad had never been a manager before, and I was brand new to my role. Brad’s new managerial role was only over two people, myself (as a new engineering technician) and Jordan (37m, and an already established engineer at this company). I wouldn’t normally include the ages in a work-related post, but I really think the age gaps are important as everyone can tell I’m quite a bit younger and, well, also a woman working in a man-dominated field. 

Our new director (let’s call him Mike) had also received a promotion at the same time. Crazy shift for the company, but we are growing quick and needed the change. Mike has been the best manager I’ve ever had, and really seems to have his employee’s best interests in mind. I never reported to him directly, but he always took time to really understand each of our goals and put the plans in place to achieve them. 

Brad and I really struggled in the beginning of our new roles. He likes to spend a good chunk of the work day talking and learning about people on a personal level, whereas I don’t trust anyone at work with my personal life and would really rather focus on my career at work. 

Brad and Jordan, however, were friends long before Brad’s promotion. They hang out together both outside and during work hours, take lunch together, and spend long hours in Brad’s office with the door shut. I never received any sort of direction from Brad no matter how many times I asked. When I would ask him questions, he would turn me away or tell me to wait until our next 1-1 (oftentimes a week away). 

Part of my new responsibilities was to take over a major system and manage it from a different team. It needed a lot of extra time and energy, and I had to shoulder all of it alone since Brad refused to help me or provide any advice. He eventually became impatient with my questions (keep in mind, I literally had no direction whatsoever, none of my questions were ever answered, and I was brand new to an engineering-type role without a degree) and he became quite rude. He would tell me he didn’t think I was cut out for this role, and he would start telling Mike the same. When this started, I stopped asking him any questions and either just decided I would never understand or if it was really important, I would go to another facility and find someone who would be willing to take time out of their day to explain things to me. Mike was extremely patient and scheduled time with me to talk things through. He scheduled a meeting for me to talk with Brad where Mike could mediate. Mike had even written a list of basic respectful rules and tips, and sent it to each of us. 

After some time, Brad had said in a 1-1 that I seemed to be getting better specifically because I was asking him less questions. Mike had set up another meeting with Brad and I, kind of as a way to end this “probationary period.” During this meeting, Brad had said he didn’t want to have this list of respectful rules Mike had sent us because, in his words, he didn’t think I would like it if he continued to abide by them. 

Brad has since displayed a lot of gaslighting and manipulative behavior. If he told me to do something and it was wrong, he would pretend like he never told me to do it. He was really really good at making bullshit sound legit, and making other people look bad in the workplace. 

I gave it some more time. Mike and Brad were clearly on different pages about what my responsibilities were (based off my meetings with each). Then I realized - it had been almost a year and I still didn’t know jack shit about what I was supposed to be doing. I started asking my questions again to Brad over email, bcc’ing Mike, and being very explicit that this was information I needed to do my job. The responses I would get would never answer my questions, and would instead beat around the bush. It really felt like either Brad just didn’t know the answers, or he was gatekeeping them, possibly to keep me in my place. Hindsight, I think it was a combination of both. It was frustrating. 

When my next 1-1 arrived with Brad, he lost his temper. He went on for over 20 minutes (of a 30 min 1-1) telling me he’s never had anybody hate him as much as I do, told me he spends more time on me than on anyone else because he thinks about me all weekend, and all the reasons why I should be more grateful to him than I was. Every time I tried to say anything, he would get worse. I resorted to just saying “ok” after everything he said until he tired himself out, and then I asked if I could be excused. 

After this 1-1, I knew I was done working for him. I polished up my resume, and reached out to Mike and let him know I would be applying for other positions (this had been something he said he would appreciate if I ever got to this point, because he would rather find something within the company that works for me rather than lose me). He said okay, and that he would work on figuring out a plan to move me, stating he would have an answer by the following week. 

Well, the following week was last week. Mike ended up moving not just me, but my entire position out from under Brad and put me under a new engineer. Things have been great working for her, and she’s been extremely pleasant. Brad is now only over one person, and it seems he and Jordan are taking it very personally. It really sucks to have burned those bridges as they are over a portion of the company that I will still be working with, and I will continue to need to interact with them. For example - Brad and Jordan started avoiding me specifically. Areas they would take their breaks in they no longer visited. Any meetings we have together, they refuse to look my way. Even though I am no longer part of their team, I am still maintaining ongoing tasks that are a part of their specific area as they have not volunteered to take them from me. Even after I asked them if they would start doing them they said they would need to talk to my new boss first (my guess is they want me to continue to do these things for them. They aren’t big tasks, so it’s fine to keep them on my plate but it really makes no sense for me to do them).

I think my main problem is managing my own emotions right now and staying professional when Brad and Jordan are clearly upset and don’t want to deal with me. I don’t like when people are upset with me, and I just want to “give in” and say whatever I need to make everything better. I’m a really small woman and I’ve learned to talk big and matter-of-factly in order to be heard where I’m at. I constantly battle with being looked down on and brushed off as if I don’t know what I’m talking about, only for what I’m saying to be a key part of discussion. I’ve had to draw some firm boundaries to keep myself progressing and prevent me from getting walked over at work. I really hate all this workplace drama as I just want to work and get the experience I need to become an engineer one day. 

Based off this, I think I have three questions:

What key takeaways can I learn from this? 

How do I continue to proceed professionally in situations where Brad and Jordan are being difficult? 

and- 

What things should I look out for going forward as far as red-flag behaviors? 

Learning to pick my battles has been tough. I’m fairly inexperienced in the whole professional workplace, so any advice you can provide would be greatly appreciated.

careerguidance,career change at 30/40,Can anybody help with career change guidance?,"Hey y’all! 27M here. I’m feeling very stuck right now. I have bachelor’s in music performance (jazz studies) and I’m currently a drum set teacher at a music school. The problem is that I don’t make enough money, let alone work enough hours, to be able to afford my own place ($18/hr, but only a max of 30 hours possible in a week, which is not even guaranteed). I had initially decided to switch paths into software development, even going back to community college to get some certifications and my associate’s in computer programming and development, yet every time I feel like I’m getting closer to my goal, it feels as if the ceiling keeps getting raised. “What projects have you worked on?”, “what certifications did you get this year?”, “what specific libraries have you used with these languages?”, the list goes on. On top of that, every job I have applied to gives me the same “at this time, we have decided to move on with different candidates”. Not to mention that the so-called “entry-level” jobs require x amount of experience to be qualified.

I am considering dropping this field entirely to go into something new, but hoping that someone here can give me some guidance as to what jobs I can look at? Or what new fields I can get into that will allow me to work the full 40 hours I need and provide the pay to live on my own (preferably jobs that pay $25/hr and/or $50k/year)?",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1mbjboo/can_anybody_help_with_career_change_guidance/,1753716642.0,Character_Photo_935,1mbjboo,advice_seeking
careerguidance,career change at 30/40,I’m an early career journalist and just got a temporary dream job offer + my FT role (~60 hour weeks). Am I setting myself up for burnout or building a future?,"I’m (25F) a journalist early in my career, and I’m at a major crossroads with a job offer that could shape my life as I know it right now. 

I just received a fixed-term offer at a legacy media company — one of those publications people dream of having on their resume. The job runs through December 31 and can be structured at 20, 30 or 40 hours/week — up to me. The pay is higher than my current FT job at any of those levels. And they’ve made it clear they want me.

Right now, I’m leaning toward taking the 20-hour option and staying in my current FT job, meaning I’d be working 60 hours/week for about 4 months by the time I start. I’ve done this kind of workload before and I saw my parents do this to make ends meet — it’s hard, but it’s doable and it would only be temporary. The new team I’d potentially work on said they want to find a spot for me long-term but if not, my plan is to just go back to locking into my current role now if I can’t go full time after Dec. 31 with the new company!

What I’m weighing:

	•	I recently attended a conference recently that reignited my love for my current job — I don’t want to give it up just as I’m finding my stride again. I originally applied to jobs months ago wanting to be done with my current newsroom due to burnout. But now, I have all these ideas I’m excited about doing with my team. I was hoping this other job wouldn’t come through even though I had a feeling from how well the interviews continued to go. 

	•	This legacy company could open doors to full-time roles later, and getting in here and now could be life-changing!

	•	The extra income would help me pay down student loans, build savings and create necessary financial cushion.

	•	As a woman of color in media, I don’t have the luxury of slow-playing my career. I need to be aggressive and intentional in building my path. I don’t have generational wealth or anything like that — I will always have to work hard for everything I have. 

My long-term bf expressed concerns about my mental health taking a hit working 60 hour weeks. He was excited and proud of me at first until I started outlining the offer details. Not saying he’s not excited and proud still, and he has not explicitly said this either — but I know he has fears that our relationship will be put on the back burner. I also know he hasn’t been job hunting seriously despite being unhappy in his own underpaid media job for the past 3 years — so I do wonder if there’s some projection happening. 

Another one of my besties thinks it’s just taking time away from the things I care about but I know work-life balance is my responsibility and I would work hard to ensure that it exists. But most of my besties are excited and think I should go for the 60 hour work week until December option, the one that I’m leaning towards. 

My bf suggested I pitch the ideas I have for my current publication to other outlets on a freelance basis instead of taking the second job, but that can be also unstable and draining — and the publication I’m at is a leader in my specific coverage area. For the new role, it would be a new beat but they’re a leader in their respective coverage area too. Bf’s right that 60 hours a week is tiring, but so is spending months sending cold pitches that might go nowhere.

I’ve worked multiple jobs before and burnt out super quick so my bf is speaking from experience and seeing the toll it took on me in real time. I think because it’s not for making ends meet and for professional development, maybe I’d approach it differently and establish work-life balance as soon as I get my schedule to implement it. 

But more importantly, I’ve got until Friday to let the new company know. I’m in deep processing and pros/cons mode to get real myself about whether or not I should do this just because I can. Even if it means it’s hard to balance at first.

I’m torn weighing the options, but it’s only temporary that I would even have two jobs anyway so I’m learning toward yes! Just don’t know if I’m missing anything or if I should think deeper about some things vs. others in this decision.

Have any of you ever worked multiple jobs to get ahead — was it worth it? Advice is appreciated here. 

TL;DR:

I’m a young journalist with a new offer from a legacy media company for a contract role through Dec. 31 — higher pay and flexible hours. I’m leaning toward doing 20 hours/week there and keeping my current FT job (totaling 60 hours/week) since I recently regained momentum in my current role and this new job could open major career doors. My boyfriend’s worried I’ll burn out and our relationship will suffer, but I feel like I can manage the balance and don’t want to pass up the chance — especially as a woman of color in media trying/needing to build long-term stability. I’m torn weighing the options, but it’s only temporary that I would even have two jobs anyway so I’m learning toward yes! Just don’t know if I’m missing anything or if I should think deeper about some things vs. others. Advice is appreciated here.

careerguidance,career change at 30/40,Freelance Remote Job that lets me move or Career change into fintech crypto company that keeps me in NYC. What are your thoughts?,"Hey folks, I could really use some perspective. I’ve been through a bit of a career storm and I’m trying to make smart moves without burning out. Here’s where I’m at:

* I’m 33 and just came off a **7-month stretch of unemployment**. During that time, I had over 25 final-round interviews but nothing landed. It wore me down hard. I have a very strong resume in the creative project management field.
* I finally accepted a **full-time role** in late May out of financial pressure. It was in-office 4 days a week, very long commute, and didn’t feel aligned at all. I gave it a month, realized it wasn’t sustainable mentally or career-wise, and respectfully quit.
* I had also been interviewing for a **contract role at $60/hr (fully remote)**, which I accepted and just started. It runs through October, starting at 30-40 hours a week and ramping up. This gives me flexibility, better work-life balance, and time to search for the *right* long-term move.
* I’m currently interviewing for a another contract at $75/hr, fully remote, longer term. If I land it, it would be a huge step up financially and resume-wise. Its in the tech space.
* I’m also getting lunch with a director at a Bitcoin mining firm. They’re full-time and in-office 5 days/week, but there’s serious long-term comp potential. Downside is I wouldn’t be able to move (I’ve been wanting to relocate to Colorado or North Caroline this year)

Financially: I’m covering bills, in some credit card debt (\~$10K), with some savings and investments left. I’m not in crisis mode and I feel confident to get back in a strong position.

Emotionally: I feel like I’ve been in constant decision-making mode, second-guessing everything. I know I’ve made bold moves to align with what I want, but I still wrestle with doubt especially after such a long period of uncertainty.

Goal: I want to move out of NYC with my girlfriend and build a life together. I have spent most of my life here and my family has left and truthfully the cost of living has gotten a bit insane. This is why the remote work is appealing to me, it allows us to get to Colorado or NC and do the things that we love. However, theres a potential transition to a very lucrative industry. I typically make between 60-80 an hour (120k-150k) a year. The BTC mining company would likely start around the same but theres very high upside and it would keep me in NYC 5 days in office, but career changes dont come around like this to often.

**Would love to hear how others have navigated big pivots, contract vs full-time tradeoffs, or mental spirals around “doing the right thing.”** Appreciate any perspective.

careerguidance,career change at 30/40,should i leave my job or am i just paranoid?,"i feel lost and confused. i kinda wanna go, but im not sure theres any better opportunities there right now which has me sticking longer here with the hopes it gets better. i dont know.

during work it's usually one of three situations that occurs weekly, it's 40% have nothing to do (which is oddly not satisfactory or fun), 30% i have something simple and short to do and i get it done no hassle, and 30% i have something that seems simple and easy to do but the direction and management has me confused going circles, losing sleep, and going crazy.

Now, the thing is, we just recently had a structural change, so the three situations may now be different, I don't know. The driven crazy has only happened twice, one was before the structural change and one is occurring now, with also a new manager and it's a lot more stressful. 

i feel so drained, and demotivated to push myself, especially since there doesn't seem to be any career progression here at all so it made me consider moving on but because of the structural change I figured maybe this time it's better and also the pay is quite nice.

I'm a 40 y.o. professional classical musician with serious burnout who is looking for a career change and am interested in talking to other people who have done this or are contemplating it.

Basically, I studied piano, organ and choral conducting made a living mainly as an accompanist and church musician in the US before making a change into vocal coaching and working in opera.  I've been moderately successful and have managed to support myself off of it for 20 years, but I was always discontent with the low pay, terrible hours, incompetent supervisors, and lack of opportunity.  Three years ago I moved to Vienna in hopes that things were better, and while I'm glad to be here it's much the same.  I'm working at a small theater for another incompetent and rude boss, am making almost nothing, and am basically on call for a 30 hour a week job.

I want to transition into a better career that has better pay, more opportunity, and better-work life balance, but I've worked as a classical musician since I was a teenager and don't really know how to do anything else.  I have three largely useless degrees in music.  I have lots of skills and learn new ones quickly, but I'm sort of at a loss as to where exactly I should go.  And I don't know how I would land a job since I don't have any degrees or experience in anything else.

careerguidance,career change at 30/40,Advice for CS Student Good at Coding but Dislikes It - Considering Future. Help?,"Hello,
I'm a CS student who, on paper, is doing well (good grades, internships in AI/ML).

Were you technically skilled/successful in tech but didn't genuinely like the work?
If so, did you stick with it? How did that turn out?
Or did you pivot to something else? What was that transition like?

I recently earned my Bachelor’s degree in Finance, and I’ve been accepted into a Ivy League Master’s program in Risk Management. While I’m proud of these accomplishments, I’ve been feeling increasingly pessimistic about my future.

I’m hesitant to take out a loan to attend grad school because I have little to no direct experience in Finance or Risk Management. The only substantial work experience I have is from working in my family’s restaurant business. When I started, we had just one location and over six years, we grew to ten restaurants in NYC. I played a big role in that growth. Unfortunately, due to family politics I had a serious fallout with my family that forced me to walk away from the business and left me starting over, trying to build a new path in Finance.

careerguidance,is a master's degree worth it,"Torn between traditional career paths and a more ""hands-on"" life: is it foolish to walk away from my master's degree?","Hi everyone,  
I'm currently facing a career dilemma and could really use some outside perspective (23M).

I recently graduated with a Master’s degree in Business Engineering and an Advanced Master in Business Communication. For years, I’ve been preparing myself for a “classic” career path: consulting, project management, sales, corporate strategy, etc.

But now that I’m graduated, it just doesn’t feel right.

The idea of a 9-to-5 office job — endless emails, meetings, KPI pressure, office politics honestly stresses me out. I feel like I’m not made for a ""rat race"". Fueled by the fact that my internship was in a somewhat toxic ""office"" environment which made me feel stressed and not in the right place, this did not help my case for wanting such a type of job at all.

I am genuinely considering a more varied, grounded, and real type of work. Lately, I’ve been seriously considering alternative paths, like becoming a train driver or police officer for example:  i.e. jobs that are more hands-on, practical, and involve real-world responsibility rather than some corporate abstraction.

Here’s the dilemma:

* On one hand, these “non-traditional” careers seem exciting, more meaningful, and less mentally draining.
* On the other hand, I’ve invested years of study and energy, and money into academic degrees that could land me high-paying jobs. Walking away feels almost irresponsible, like I’d be “wasting” my education.

  
How do I decide what’s right for me?  
Does this situation feel familiar? Has anyone made a similar switch; from office/corporate life to something more “out there”? Was it worth it?

Any insights, personal experiences, or honest advice would be truly appreciated.

careerguidance,is a master's degree worth it,Is a second Bachelor's Degree worth it if my company will pay for it?,"Hello,

I recently graduated with a B.S in Hospitality Management. I have a great job for my age in my field, but I'm always looking at what's next. In discussions with most executive leaders in my company, I learned that many have backgrounds in Industrial Engineering. I have been looking into Master's programs in Industrial Engineering, but with my Hospitality background, I know I do not have the necessary tools and background to be admitted. My company will reimburse me for my classes and course materials, which is a huge win, as I am quickly finding out that student loans are rough. I have heard many describe a second bachelor's degree as ""a waste of time,"" but I feel that this degree will be a drastic pivot from my original field of study, making it worthwhile.

careerguidance,is a master's degree worth it,25m engineer trying to switch to CS through a masters in CS for stem majors….i feel so far behind…is it worth it…is this a waste of time?,"TLDR: 25m trying to switch from engineer -> CS. Currently taking a masters in CS for STEM majors at USC but don’t feel like I’m making the most of the degree because I’m taking it part time and online because I’m still working as an engineer. In total going to take 3.5 years and I’m worried that nothing is going to come from this degree afterwards. 95k and 3.5 years of work/school



I’m 25m who took an undergrad in engineering, and have a stable 90k job as an engineer. I feel like that’s not enough especially in California so I wanted to switch to CS cuz some friends in CS are making crazy money.

Its a masters in CS for STEM majors at USC that im taking part time online and its gonna take me 3.5 years because im working and doing it part time

I feel like im behind because im learning how to use platforms like Bitbucket and virtual boxes while These courses are going through how to design an operating system. I don’t know if I have the endurance to last 3.5 years. I don’t know if I have the discipline to do this online because it’s so much harder to learn something essentially by yourself and harder to reach out to people when you can’t just have a face to face convo with them. I don’t have any classmate support. I feel so overwhelmed and when I do that I just stop working and that makes it worse and lets the work pile up more. I feel like I should move to LA to do this (I have fam there) but it’s v bad situation living with that family and is the reason I moved out in the first place.

I feel like im half assing this degree because my plan is to use my company connections to hopefully get an internship and Job which is in part why im still working, along with being able to pay bills and save.

I’m worried that even with this degree I won’t have learned enough to compete with all the fobs who’ve been coding since they’ve been 5. My whole plan is literally to use connections to get my way into a position In my company or another reputable one that my friends work at. My thinking is that realistically how much of your degree does anyone use after they graduate? Most people just need to have the basics and then learn the rest on the job.

But can I even get a job with all these people to compete with?

Is this all worth it?

Am I about to spend $95k on a masters degree that’s not going to get me anywhere, no connections because I’m online. It’s worse because it’s not even my money, my dads shelling out for it, so what happens if at the end of all this, sleepless nights, coming back from work tired and trying to catch up to every other Asian dude out there who also wants a FAANG job? Am I cooked? I can work hard and am decently smart but I’ve never been the smartest of everyone, just better than most. My largest strength was always my personality which I planned to use to get a leg up on other SWE and such but what happens if I can’t get the foot in the door? Or even pass these damn classes?

careerguidance,is a master's degree worth it,Feeling Stuck at 26 With a Master’s Degree — Is a Second Bachelor’s Worth It?,"I’d love some input on what a good next move might be for me career-wise. I’ll try to keep it quick and to the point.

I have a bachelor’s in Music Education and a master’s in Jazz Studies. My original goal was to become a music teacher, either at the secondary or university level. After grad school, I worked as an adjunct professor for a year — it was fulfilling and aligned with my goals, but it didn’t pay the bills.

Now I work as an Administrative Assistant in the College of Fine Arts Dean’s Office at a large university. The pay isn’t amazing (\~$50k), but it’s a good change of pace, solid resume builder, and comes with excellent tuition reduction benefits.

That said, I’m feeling pretty burnt out on music and teaching right now. I’m considering using the tuition benefits to get a second bachelor’s in something more practical, but I’m also wondering if this admin role could be a solid jumping-off point for higher-paying positions — maybe even outside of higher ed. I'm not opposed to staying in administrative roles.

So, my main question is:  
**Is there real potential for growth and better pay on the admin path I’m currently on? Or would it be smarter to use the tuition benefits now and get a more ""practical"" second degree?**

I’m not looking to be rich — just want to feel confident that I’m on a path toward decent, stable income.

careerguidance,is a master's degree worth it,Is it okay to not have a master’s degree if I’m happy working in my family business?,"Hi everyone,

I’m 23, done with my graduation and a couple of certificate courses, and have been working in my well-established family business for the past two years. I genuinely love what I do and feel happy and satisfied with my work.

However, I sometimes find myself doubting whether it’s “normal” to live in a world full of CAs, MBAs, lawyers, doctors, etc., without a master’s degree. Does your degree still matter if you’re doing well financially and are happy with your career? Or is it just societal pressure?

Also, if I were to pursue a master’s or MBA while continuing to work in my family business, what course would you recommend for someone in this position? Would it be worth it, or would focusing on growing the business be a better investment of my time and energy?

Would love to hear your thoughts, especially from those who have chosen not to pursue a master’s or those who balanced it while running a business.

careerguidance,is a master's degree worth it,37w went back to school to finish my associates degree hoping to get a masters as a dietitian. Is it worth it?,"So I am a 37-year-old woman and I don’t have any college degree. I don’t have any certifications. Well, I have a nutritional aid certification from university online that was a free course. It’s good for three years. A nutrition educator to be exact. I decided to go back to school because I needed to hire my education so that I can get higher paying jobs. I’m currently a teacher assistant at an elementary school working with special needs children. 

Before I was working in admin at offices and then I took a few years off while my husband worked so that I can take care of the kids. Sometimes I just don’t feel smart or skilled enough and I think it’s because I took so much time off of work that I’ve lost like my working skills. So that’s why I went to school because I was nervous that I didn’t really understand computers anymore and my typing skills are trash, which is why it’s been hard for me to get a remote job because I always fail the typing test. 

I kinda know what I need to do but then I get overwhelmed and then just do nothing. 

So I said let’s go back to school. Let’s try this again because I will drop out all the time and really messed up my transcript. I’ve been back officially since last year fall and I have passed all my classes so I’m on a good path with staying focused with school, but I’m thinking with this economy. Is this even the right choice to do school in nutrition. I’ve been using grants since I was 19 so my grant money is running out. I probably have like maybe one semester or two semesters left of grant money where I’ll have to start taking out loans to finish school. 

My advisor suggested that I switched to transfer studies, but I’m currently on probation so I can’t switch my associates nutrition degree until I raise my GPA. So I’ve messed up so many times I’m kinda in a little bit of a pickle where you get kind of stuck and you have no choice but to take certain jobs or to do certain things just to get out of the hole. 

I really just want a really good high paying job and I would love to get into tech and even possibly AI but how do I do that like is it worth me going back to school? Do I need to switch my degree? Am I being delusional. Something has to change because my car broke down. I don’t have the money to fix it. Nobody really wants to buy it because it’s an old Benz . I’ve had this since 2006 and it’s a 2003 so I don’t have transportation to get around. And the area that I live in their buses run every two hours so it hasn’t really been the best and then they stopped running at 2 PM. Can’t afford Uber or Lyft every day to work so I found a school job I can walk to for now. My plan is to stick with this job until I can figure out something else. I am in a relationship with my children’s father three years. He was recently laid off, but then found a LUBE tech job up the street. Since it’s his car planning on, basically me dropping him off then dropping off the boys to school then going to work and then I pick up everybody after school. It’s a sacrifice we’re both gonna have to make with these jobs until I can get a new car then we both have the freedom to go work where we want.

careerguidance,quit job to start business,"Quitting My Job, Starting a Business in a New City, and Closing on a House Today… Am I Making a Huge Mistake?","Here’s the backstory:

23M.

About 8 months ago, I got a decent-paying job in North Carolina (around $70K/year), but the commute was brutal — one hour each way — and it really started taking a toll on my mental health.

On top of that, I have a side business (started 5 years ago in college) that brings in between $25K–$40K in profit annually (this year it's looking like \~$38K). So, back in January, I decided to buy a house with a long-time friend. We both wanted to stop throwing money away on rent and be closer to work. We put down a good-sized deposit on a new build.

Then things got messy…

In March, my boss started gaslighting me and other coworkers — about work stuff, but also personal things. Upper management lies to our HQ constantly about what’s happening on-site, making us all look bad. I get that no job is perfect, and I was honestly willing to tough it out.

**But then in May, it got worse.**  
About 20 of us got an email from HR out of nowhere saying we were being switched from salaried to hourly, **effective immediately.** We lost a bunch of benefits: unlimited sick time, stock purchase program, access to Workday and other company tools — all gone.

To top it off, we didn’t even have access to the tool the rest of the company uses to log hours. We had to punch in on a physical clock, and the hours punched determine our pay. I asked what my new hourly rate was, and my manager *showed me on his computer* but said I wouldn’t get it in writing — “just check your pay stub.”

First payday after the switch? My paycheck was **$500 short**. Same with 19 other employees. I had proof of my hours. We raised hell, and HR finally had a meeting where they *admitted* they’d known this was coming for 10 months — meaning **they lied to me when I accepted the job**.

It took **a month** to get the $700 they owed me, and only after I went way up the chain and said I’d sue if they didn’t fix it. My manager even pulled me into a conference room and yelled at me, saying I was “embarrassing him in front of the office” by showing him proof of my hours.

4 of my last 5 paychecks have been incorrect, and every fix takes at least 2 weeks.

**Then the house drama:**  
Trying to explain all this to the bank was a nightmare. I had multiple meetings with our legal department, HR kept blaming the bank, and the bank blamed HR. I know HR caused the delay because they were too embarrassed to admit what had happened.

I’m just… exhausted. Fighting every paycheck. No transparency. My manager says, “don’t worry, it’ll all be fixed soon” — but gives no timeline. I don’t believe him anymore.

So 3 months ago, I started looking at other options — and really fell in love with the idea of going all-in on my business in a new city. I’ve been doing research and planning since May. I’ve already covered the startup costs, signed a lease in the new city (move-in is August 16), and I’ve got $35K in savings (not counting retirement).

My expenses are about to jump though — from practically nothing (I own my car and only pay $100/month insurance) to:

* $750/month mortgage
* $950/month rent in the new city for at least a year

The guy I’m buying the house with is letting me rent out one of my two rooms, which will cover at least half the mortgage. I also expect to have another roommate starting in January, which could cover almost all of it.

**Here’s the kicker:**  
My mom really wants me to go back to school and get a Master’s degree (in the same city where I’m launching the business). She’s worried that if I quit this job without having school lined up, it’ll hurt my future prospects. I already have a bachelor’s in Industrial Engineering.

I got accepted into a 1-year Master’s program, but tuition is $34K. My parents originally agreed to loan me $20K toward it, but now they’re getting cold feet.

Honestly, I’d *love* to get my Master’s — I think it could help the business too, since I rely heavily on hiring college students — but I also think I can get the business off the ground without it.

**So… here’s where I’m at:**

* I close on the house TODAY
* I plan to give my two weeks’ notice on Monday
* I move to a new city in two weeks to launch my business full-time
* I *might* be taking on a $34K Master’s program, depending on my parents’ support

**Am I making the right move?**  
The job market is rough, and I’m taking on a lot of risk. But I’m also walking away from a toxic situation that’s been dragging me down for months.

It drains me.

I’ve been doing a lot of thinking and I really want to become a Data Analyst. I’m especially interested in pursuing a Master’s in Statistics and Data Science.

It feels like everyone wants experience, even for “entry-level” jobs.

My job offers $4,200 per year in tuition reimbursement, but only if the degree is directly related to healthcare or business. I could try to stretch it and argue that data science in a hospital is relevant, but I’m not sure it would be approved. Regardless, I still feel like I’m wasting time every day staying in this role.

Would it be crazy to just quit and go all in on grad school? I know it’s risky without experience, but I feel so stuck and miserable where I am. I don’t want to waste another year hoping something will magically change.

I know I don’t really owe them anything but I have no idea how to go about resigning, whether I should just email a letter or do it in person, and I’m really worried about how they’ll react and how it’s going to go if i tough out 2-3 weeks until my last day … any advice is appreciated, I feel like at the end of the day I just gotta grow a sack and get it over with and tough shit out until gone",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1jqo2fo/how_to_quit_a_job_that_relies_on_you_heavily/,1743700197.0,Routine_Hold4560,1jqo2fo,advice_seeking
careerguidance,quit job to start business,"I want to quit my IT job after 2 years of working without a new one lined up, am I in the wrong here?","Hello everyone! First of all, please forgive my grammar, English is not my first language and there isn’t a careerguidance reddit for my country, so here I am.

As I stated in the title, I am on the verge of quitting my job, I am a Business Analyst for a big company, have been doing this for the past 2 years and a half and I am so over it. Between juggling multiple positions at the same time (our PO does absolutely nothing, I have to test every single thing our devs do, etc), getting blamed for every single thing that goes wrong in our team and being told everything I do is wrong (but not giving me advice on how to fix it nor firing me for some reason) I have become so depressed and anxious that even my family is begging me to quit.

The problem is, I feel extremely guilty, I have seen so many posts of people applying for jobs for over a year and not getting it that I feel like I shouldn’t even complain, “at least I have a job”, is what I tell myself. The job market is also bad where I live, this also makes me feel paralyzed as I don’t know what to do.

I have about 30k USD saved up right now, and my family is willing to support me and let me stay with them for however long I need to, they are even offering me to support me through college again if that’s what I want to do, but I still feel insanely bad about quitting, I like my team, I dislike my manager (it’s mutual) and almost every single manager above him.

The questions that keep me up all night are “what if i don’t get a job”, “what if I do but it turns out to be worse than the one I have”, and most importantly, “what if I can’t find a remote position anymore”.

I need advice, my entire family and friends are telling me that quitting is the best thing I can do, but I would like to hear unbiased opinions if possible, thank you! 

Note: I got a CS degree a couple of years ago and I started working while I was in college, I would like to leave the corporate setup completely, I don’t think it’s a good fit for me. If I were to go back to college I would not get another IT degree. Yes, I regret getting a CS degree.

Science Policy Proposal: Eliminating Shareholder-Only Accountability in Food, Drug, and Healthcare Industries to Prevent Consumer Harm and AI Exploitation

Executive Summary The food, drug, and healthcare industries wield enormous influence over public health and safety, yet their legal shield of shareholder primacy has enabled them to evade accountability for actions that harm consumers. This proposal argues for a science-informed policy to eliminate the doctrine that companies are accountable solely to their shareholders. Instead, companies must uphold direct accountability to their customers and the public, particularly in an era when artificial intelligence (AI) enables unprecedented levels of exploitation. AI technologies are increasingly deployed to deny valid claims, identify vulnerable populations, and manipulate consumer behavior, exacerbating inequities and eroding trust in essential systems. This proposal outlines regulatory measures to ensure transparency, ethical AI use, and corporate accountability to protect public health and safety.

Problem Statement

Currently, corporations in the food, drug, and healthcare industries often invoke the principle of shareholder primacy, which prioritizes profit maximization above other considerations. This focus has led to severe consequences: 1. Harm to Consumers: From contaminated food supplies to harmful drugs approved through manipulated processes, consumers are often left to bear the consequences of corporate misconduct. 2. AI-Driven Exploitation: Companies are using AI systems to target vulnerable populations, such as individuals deemed less likely to contest wrongful health insurance claim denials. This practice compounds harm by exploiting those with the fewest resources to resist. 3. Evasion of Accountability: The current legal framework allows companies to escape responsibility for decisions that prioritize shareholder returns over consumer safety and welfare.

The combination of these factors undermines public trust in essential systems, worsens health outcomes, and disproportionately harms marginalized communities.

Policy Objectives 1. End Shareholder-Only Accountability: Ensure that companies in these industries are legally required to prioritize consumer safety and public welfare alongside financial performance. 2. Regulate AI Usage: Develop strict regulations to govern the use of AI in decision-making processes that impact public health, such as claim approvals and targeted marketing. 3. Establish Stronger Liability Standards: Hold companies legally and financially liable for harm caused by their products, services, or AI-driven decisions.

Policy Recommendations 1. Amend Corporate Accountability Laws: • Modify corporate governance laws to require directors of food, drug, and healthcare companies to consider public health and safety in decision-making. • Establish legal consequences for prioritizing shareholder returns at the expense of consumer welfare. 2. Implement AI Governance Standards: • Require independent audits of AI systems used in claim adjudication, customer targeting, and other decision-making processes. • Prohibit AI algorithms from targeting vulnerable populations (e.g., by exploiting behavioral data or predicting likelihood of inaction). • Mandate transparency in AI decision-making processes, including the publication of audit results. 3. Strengthen Consumer Protections: • Create federal-level mechanisms for consumers to challenge wrongful claim denials without financial barriers. • Enforce stricter liability standards for harmful products or practices, with penalties commensurate with the scale of harm caused. • Develop whistleblower protections for employees who report unethical or harmful corporate practices. 4. Support Ethical Business Practices: • Offer tax incentives or grants to companies that demonstrate a commitment to ethical AI usage and prioritize public welfare. • Establish public-private partnerships to research and implement consumer safety innovations in food, drug, and healthcare sectors.

Anticipated Outcomes 1. Improved Consumer Safety: By holding companies accountable, the proposed policies would significantly reduce incidents of harm caused by unsafe products and unethical practices. 2. Ethical AI Deployment: Clear regulations will ensure AI is used to benefit, rather than exploit, consumers, fostering trust in new technologies. 3. Equity and Fairness: Vulnerable populations will be protected from AI-driven targeting and other exploitative practices, promoting equitable access to essential services. 4. Increased Public Trust: Transparent corporate practices and robust accountability measures will rebuild trust in food, drug, and healthcare industries.

Funding and Implementation • Funding Mechanisms: Leverage fines collected from non-compliance to fund oversight agencies. Encourage private investment in compliance tools, such as ethical AI systems. • Implementation Timeline: • Year 1: Draft legislation, engage stakeholders, and develop regulatory frameworks. • Year 2: Pilot AI auditing programs and create public reporting platforms. • Year 3: Fully implement policy changes with ongoing monitoring and adaptation.

Conclusion

The unchecked prioritization of shareholder interests over consumer safety in the food, drug, and healthcare industries is a systemic failure that must be addressed. This failure is compounded by the misuse of AI, which magnifies harm through targeted exploitation. By implementing this science-driven policy, we can ensure that these industries operate ethically, prioritize public health, and leverage AI responsibly, creating a safer and more equitable society.

antiwork,passed over for promotion,My boss quit without giving anyone in my team a performance review. No one is getting a bonus or up for promotion.,"I work in a tech startup, so the salary isn't great. We generally are used to getting an annual bonus at the end of the year which helps quite a bit with staying afloat in my city.

The director in charge of my team quit before he was supposed to give us all our performance assessments and pass on his recommendations to the leadership. 

HR just announced that because there was no performance review completed,  my entire time will be missing out on bonuses and no one will be up for promotions. 

Meanwhile the new director taking over the team gets to work part time, remotely, for an incredibly high salary.

antiwork,passed over for promotion,Is it legal for a union to decide my wage if the company coded my position as non-union?,"I work as a supervisor at a hotel, if that matters. Some whole departments are union. Their wages are decided through collective bargaining and enumerated in a contract. So, the banquet department is union. They all get the same pay with a yearly cost-of-living bump unless otherwise decided by the union. They are not allowed to negotiate their wages individually, but they also have union protections-- like they can't be asked to do something outside their job descriptions or fired without just cause. If they pay dues, they can go to meetings and take part in negotiation.

Then, the front desk isn't union. So, they can negotiate individually and don't have union protections. It basically doesn't affect them.

In F&B/outlets, everyone is union except leadership. When I was onboarded, I was told that I would be able to join the union. A couple months later, I learned that wasn't true. Actually, as a supervisor, I'm ""leadership,"" despite making way less money and not having any of the benefits of being a manager. So, I can't be a union member or participate in the bargaining process. BUT, since I've been there for a year and just got passed over for a promotion, I asked my boss if I could at least have a raise. Turns out: I ALSO can't have a merit-based raise or negotiate my own wage in any way, because no hourly that works in F&B is allowed to negotiate individually.

I feel trapped. I've literally put 150% into this job, even though I make poverty wages, because I used to love my work and thought I was a shoe-in for this promotion. Now I learn that I legally cannot even get a raise for doing well.

I'm wondering how the fuck it could be legal that I literally have no way to advocate for myself to make more money.

WHY WOULDN'T THEY AT LEAST BE OBLIGATED TO EXPLAIN THIS TO ME BEFORE I AGREED TO WORK THERE?

Edit: I live in Wisconsin, and HR confirmed that this was true just a couple of days ago.

Edit: After doing some research, I feel that I may be illegally classified as a supervisor under the National Labor Relations Act. (Especially since the job description that I signed was authored in 2005, and there have been many changes to the legal definition of supervisor since then.) I'm going to speak to the union rep, get a copy of the CBA, and possibly consult an attorney tomorrow.

antiwork,passed over for promotion,Yoga taught me to stand in my truth. Reporting wage violations at CorePower cost me my job.,"**TL;DR:**  
I worked at CorePower Yoga for over 5 years and loved it—until I reported wage violations for time clock manipulation and mileage denial. After speaking up, I faced ongoing retaliation: being blamed for my manager’s termination, and hostile behavior from peers. HR acknowledged the retaliation but took little action. I was eventually removed from the schedule, terminated and offered a small settlement to waive my rights. My personnel file had no record of my complaints or the investigations that followed. Details below.

# 🗓️ September–October 2024

While applying for a promotion, I noticed I was scheduled to work over 80 hours that pay period. I emailed my manager to ask what I should do. She texted back:

>“Are you ok with going over this week and pulling it from next week?”

Wanting to be a team player, I agreed—but I also documented my hours with a screenshot just in case.

In the next pay period, I drove to a required training in another city. I was told I could clock in for the drive and would be reimbursed for mileage. As a result of attending, I again worked over 80 hours. My manager changed my time records and later told me in the studio:

>“CorePower doesn’t pay overtime.”

When I asked about the promised mileage, she said:

>“This wasn’t mandatory training.”

She altered the time logs before I could screenshot them, but I found proof in the Dayforce app showing some of my original times and saved it.

That’s when I realized: if I didn’t speak up, this would keep happening.

# 🗓️ November 2024

I filed a formal internal wage complaint and requested compensation for unpaid overtime and mileage. I sent it by email and received confirmation on November 26th.

I was proud of myself for standing up—but I had no idea this would set off a chain of retaliation that would ultimately lead to my termination.

# 🗓️ December 2024

A few days later, my manager emailed about carpooling to another training:

>“We're leaving around 7:30am if you want to join. If you're planning on driving yourself... your shift wouldn't begin until you arrive \[at 10am\].”

I replied:

>“Given the unresolved nature of this matter \[wage complaint\]... I believe it’s best to drive myself.” “To clarify your email, are you saying that if I drive myself, I would only clock in at 10 AM upon arrival at the training, but if I join the carpool, I can clock in at 7:30 AM? This seems inconsistent with what you have told me in the past ... I’d appreciate an explanation of the reasoning behind this policy.”

She responded:

>“You are not paid hourly for your drive. That is the company policy.” “In the past... I allowed you to be paid... but moving forward, we will strictly adhere to company policy.”

This felt retaliatory. I decided to file a filed an official wage complaint with the state and applied for medical leave, which was approved to start in early January 2025.

**After driving to the training without being paid**, I contacted HR to confirm whether this was truly company policy—especially since it seemed to conflict with state law. We scheduled a call, and during the conversation, I was surprised to learn that HR hadn’t even been made aware of my internal wage complaint that I made over a week ago. I followed up afterward in writing:

>“Thank you for confirming that \[my manager’s\] actions... didn’t align with company policy.” “If I’m being candid, the travel email felt retaliatory after I requested overtime pay.”

Shortly after, my manager was terminated for cause. But the retaliation escalated. My terminated manager appears to have told the Lead Instructor (LI) a false version of events. The LI allegedly sent a resignation email blaming me for her termination. I never saw the email, but was told by coworkers it had been shared widely and he had been speaking about it in the studio.

LI then showed up at the studio I managed for a yoga class he was supposed to teach. Before entering the studio I saw him speaking with staff and students in the parking lot and it seemed like he was actively discouraging people from attending the class.

After some time passed he came inside the studio, I asked him what was going on. He said:

>“You know damn well what is going on.” “You got \[the manager\] fired.” “What did you think would happen when you hired a lawyer?”

At the time I was aware that my manager was terminated nor had I hired a lawyer—I was trusting HR to handle it. When I asked where he got that information, he said:

>“I’m not going to reveal my sources, but I cannot be around you.”

He stayed in the parking lot for some time after to continue to discourage people from entering. Despite his attempts one student still came in, and I taught the class even though I was emotionally wrecked and still shocked from what just happened.

I reported it this HR that day and their response was:

>“Thank you for sharing the below of what occurred today. I'm sorry that you did experience this. Please know that we take this matter very seriously."" ""Yes, \[The Manager\]'s employment with CPY has been terminated. That however, should not result in you experiencing this behavior from peers”

In a another email days later HR wrote:

>“\[The Manager\] shared her side... it does not reflect the truth. Staff were reminded of our anti-retaliation policy.”

But no real action was taken. HR offered to start my leave early, and I accepted.

# 🗓️ March 5 -26 2025

With leave ending soon, I asked HR to transfer to another location via email on March 5. HR didn’t respond until March 25 where they scheduled another phone call. During this call March 26, they denied the request.

They stated something to the effect of:

>“We can’t say what it’s been like... but we don’t tolerate retaliation.” “Some vocal parties are gone... hopefully it’s a clean slate for you.”

**Just days before my return**, a former CPY instructor informed me of the LI’s resignation email. They informed me had included details about my wage complaint and blamed me for my manager’s termination. I emailed HR stating that this was clearly retaliation and met the standard for constructive discharge. I also requested that all further communication remain in writing.

HR replied:

>“We weren’t aware of any specific messages the LI sent. His resignation was accepted.”

# 🗓️ March 31 – April 17

**While checking my work email to see if I had received the LI’s resignation email from December, I discovered that someone had been given access to my account during my leave.** On March 17, this person forwarded private emails between me and HR regarding my complaints. Then, on March 31, they used my account to instruct staff to report me if I entered the studio. The replies from staff reflected concern, as if I were being perceived as a threat.

I reported this to HR again on April 2. Instead of addressing the breach, they removed me from the schedule the next day—preventing me from clocking in or receiving pay. I continued asking questions about what had happened but received minimal answers.

The following week, HR tried to schedule a call to discuss a “settlement.” I declined and asked that all communication remain in writing. After several follow-ups, they said on April 11 they would draft an offer. Without further communication, I was officially terminated on April 17 and offered a small payout in exchange for waiving my legal rights—and what seemed like my silence. I declined.

# 🗓️ April 24 – Current

I requested my personnel file on April 24 and asked for it to be sent digitally. HR delayed, saying they needed time to compile it. After multiple follow-ups with no timeline, I emailed the CEO on May 12. I finally received the digital file on May 14—after what felt like continued delay tactics. Upon reviewing it, I was disappointed to see the file had actually been compiled back on April 29 and contained no mention of my wage complaint or the related investigations.

antiwork,passed over for promotion,My F*ck-It Meter is 95% of the way to quitting.,"I have no leads or backup plan, but have been trying to get out of this job as long as I've been here. I've been at this job at an assistant level for almost 2 years. I have not been promoted to a designer despite designing really cool work that makes the company a lot of money and gets a lot of praise on socials and from other colleagues. My manager keeps hiring other designers instead of promoting me. She has hired two new designers in the past 3 months.

Other things to note:

I'm on a PIP for tardiness (which feels like my death sentance). My work is otherwise good and I do it and meet every single deadline.

I've already applied for another internal role for a higher salary and one thats more career aligned in graphic design. Got passed over because of my lack of ""experience"" even though I have done graduate school and have 3 years of prior design experience.

I have complained and complained about this job so much. I'm so done. I want to move to New York and start a new chapter in my life. I don't know how I'm going to do it, at all. I don't have a job lined up for me out there. I almost had an in at my friends company and the hiring manager said the same thing about my lack of experience. I have 5 years of design experience now, what else do they want? I'll give them my left toe if it means I can get out of this awful small business in the bay area.

antiwork,passed over for promotion,“Promoted” to new role 4 months ago but STILL waiting for official promotion,"I’ve been working for this company for over 2.5 years now. This is my first career oriented job after college. After 2 years, I pretty much mastered my role, while taking on various projects and challenges that no one else wanted, to gain experience. My boss, who I had a great relationship with, got promoted. Got a new boss who I ended up really liking as well. I ended up getting more work and was starting to feel like I deserved a new role/promotion. 

Around 5 months ago, my old boss (my new boss’s manager) started to have me work on a project that was completely new to the company. Only him and I knew anything about the project, i had no previous knowledge or training of the work. Slowly I started to take on more and more work of the project. My previous responsibilities were passed over to another employee. 

At first, the new work was pretty stressful and confusing. But now I’ve got it pretty streamlined, still it’s pretty confusing and I feel like I’m the most knowledgeable on the subject at my company. 

After working on this new job for a month, I started to get resentful, since I had taken on more responsibilities, yet I had a title that didn’t match the work at all and also had no raise. I felt underpaid. So I started applying to other jobs. I had a couple interviews lined up. 

On the last day of work before Christmas break, my boss and his boss (my former boss) told me they’d get me a new title and raise. They said it’d be a new position for the company, so they’d have to work with HR. It was a relief because I had grown very resentful and was doing less work due to my frustration. They didn’t tell me the specific title. 

It’s been two months since then. I’ve been told a few times that HR is still working on things, that everything is set on my manager’s end. I went on an international trip with my boss’s boss last month regarding my new role. A week ago he told me that we’re a “day or two” away from having everything straightened out. Still nothing. Meanwhile, I had a long interview with another company a couple days ago. It sounds like I’ll get a job offer soon, hopefully with my desired salary, which would be 15% higher. 

I don’t want to leave this company because I like it and I like the people i work with. I like my bosses. But I feel like I’m being taken advantage of. I’m house shopping so this raise would be great right now. If I left this company, there’d be a pretty big hole since no one knows how to do my job.

Recently, a manager approached me and tried to coach me for not wearing my walkie earpiece. I tried to explain — if I wear the earpiece in my only working ear, I can’t hear customers on the sales floor. That’s not just an inconvenience — it directly impacts how I do my job.

Instead of engaging with that or helping find a solution, the manager doubled down and dismissed the issue. I got emotional and told them firmly I wasn’t going to be coached for a condition that I can’t control. I was told to leave the floor.

Later, my direct boss (who I’ve always had a good relationship with) told me we’ll fill out an accommodation form next time I’m in, but I still feel like I was dismissed and treated unfairly — possibly discriminated against — *because of a disability*.

My name is ——————-and I am over the age of eighteen (18) years, competent to make this affidavit, and have personal knowledge of the facts herein stated, which are true and correct to the best of my knowledge. I make this affidavit under penalty of aggravated perjury, as defined in Texas Penal Code § 37.03, which states that a person commits aggravated perjury if they knowingly make a false material statement during an official proceeding. This is classified as a third-degree felony, punishable by 2 to 10 years imprisonment and a fine not to exceed $10,000.


I was retained as an independent contractor by Renfrow and performed services in good faith. Despite this, my payment has been unlawfully withheld in retaliation for internal complaints and after a series of hostile incidents.


I assert that under Texas Labor Code § 61.014, withholding wages due to unrelated disputes, such as alleged missing equipment, is explicitly prohibited. Even if an employer eventually issues payment, the act of withholding wages in retaliation or based on unsupported or unrelated justifications still constitutes wage theft. Additionally, there were multiple other instances in which my payment was withheld or delayed arbitrarily, such as when supervisors cited missed invoice submission windows, internal scheduling issues, forgetfulness, or vague administrative errors. These excuses do not excuse the unlawful delay or denial of compensation. Each such incident constitutes an independent violation of wage payment law under Texas statutes.


Moreover, when I attempted to inquire about my pay, either to confirm when a check would be available or to seek reassurance, I was frequently met with a tone of irritation or treated as though I was being rude, demanding, or disruptive. Even when my inquiries were made politely, calmly, and respectfully, they were often perceived or mischaracterized as bothersome. This hostile reception occurred both in person and over the phone. It reached the point where I stopped making such inquiries by phone altogether, especially after the incident referenced later in this affidavit, when Kyle falsely accused me of harassment simply for calling a few times in a polite and professional manner to ask about payment. At no point did I raise my voice or speak in an aggressive tone, and yet I was treated as if I had done something wrong simply for seeking the wages I had earned.
I took multiple steps to protect the allegedly missing jackhammer, including storing it in my personal shop and attempting to deliver it as instructed. It was stolen moments after I parked in front of a security guard. The theft was reported to police under HPD Incident Report No. 172406524.


I also attempted to retrieve surveillance footage from a nearby gas station and from the security vehicle, though the incident was not captured. The guard corroborated that thefts were rare in that area and suggested I may have been followed or targeted.


The tool in question was not the one I requested. I asked for an SDS MAX hammer drill appropriate for the job. The company instead issued me a jackhammer, which was excessive, difficult to secure, and not aligned with the scope of work.


Despite being provided with the wrong equipment, I completed the job to the best of my ability and maintained professional conduct throughout.


I did not inform Matthew of the theft immediately because I was concerned about the hostile work environment and feared unjustified blame or retaliation. My hesitancy was rooted in legitimate workplace safety concerns, not any attempt to withhold information. I had every intention  to replace the equipment with an equivalent but was never given a model nor serial number nor could I pay for it until I was paid my “late” checks. Not to mention the alleged ridiculous demand given to Mathew to replace it with a brand new $2000 model. 


I have been subjected to ongoing harassment, retaliation, and efforts to discredit me by multiple employees, including Santos, Christian Carter, Sasha, and Kyle, despite consistently conducting myself with professionalism.


Santos once asked me whether I could “kill Christian Carter,” a statement I found deeply inappropriate and disturbing. Such a comment may qualify as criminal solicitation under Texas Penal Code § 15.03.


Christian Carter had a publicly visible history of substance abuse involving controlled substances  posted by him on social media. He remains in a safety-sensitive position without any known evidence of recovery or oversight, to my knowledge. It would have been inappropriate for me to inquire directly into this matter. Moreover, given my prior experience with being denied access to any Human Resources process or personnel, raising such concerns would have fallen on deaf ears or caused further retaliation.


I experienced repeated acts of intimidation and hostility, on or about 2023 and continuing, particularly around paydays. In one incident, I waited patiently in the front office for a delayed paycheck, only to be aggressively confronted by Santos and later Sasha in a staged and manipulative fashion that made me feel cornered and targeted.


Their coordinated conduct gave the appearance of creating a false narrative, that I was confrontational or harassing, when in truth I remained calm, polite, and simply wanted my earnings. This pattern reflects psychological coercion and workplace retaliation.


Kyle falsely implied that I had harassed her, apparently in response to my professional inquiries about delayed payments or reimbursements. These claims are categorically false, and I now document all calls and communications to protect myself.


Christian Carter sent bizarre and accusatory messages to both me and my brother. I suspected he may have been under the influence, or possibly engaging in retaliatory behavior alongside Kyle. I have no explanation for this. Only he could explain. I even sent a photo of the message to Matthew, who later said he inquired generally if anyone had problems with me. Everyone allegedly denied any issue. However, subtle and targeted mistreatment continued in more coy and manipulative forms.


This is precisely why I am intending to file a civil suit, to compel testimony under oath and exercise legal discovery rights. If Carter or others refuse a lawful deposition, a judge has authority to impose sanctions, fines, or issue a bench warrant. Civil litigation is not revenge, it is the only lawful mechanism available for me to uncover the full truth under oath from individuals whose conduct has directly harmed me.
If Renfro does not honor my formal request that these false statements be retracted, and that the employees involved be reprimanded, retrained, or otherwise held accountable, and if the company refuses to establish a legally required Human Resources system, then litigation becomes unavoidable. Under both Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq.) and Texas Labor Code Chapter 21, employers with 15 or more employees are legally obligated to implement anti-retaliation and discrimination complaint procedures, including maintaining a structured HR process. Failure to do so constitutes not only corporate negligence but potential civil rights violations.
Matthew, in contrast, treated me with consistent professionalism and fairness. I demand that he not be held liable for the missing jackhammer or otherwise scapegoated. To do so would be retaliatory and unjust.


Although I was classified as an independent contractor, Renfro exercised direct control over my schedule, duties, and daily assignments, thereby meeting the legal standard for an employment relationship under Texas Labor Code §§ 201.041, 214.008, and IRS guidelines.


The company maintained a rigid “Net 14” payment structure, yet often delayed checks beyond that period due to clerical excuses, internal confusion, or failure to process payroll. These practices contributed to my financial instability and appear to be used as convenient coercive tools.


Despite providing valid receipts, I was refused reimbursement unless used tools, or used consumables were physically present on  Christian Carters Desk, a demand that lacked any legal or logical basis. I eventually received only a token amount of around $175. months late and far less than what I was owed.


I have previously filed successful civil actions, including Sanchez v. Van Der Oord.
I have preserved all communications, photos, geotagged data, and call logs related to my work with Renfro. These records are archived and stored securely and can be submitted as evidence in litigation.


I intend to pursue civil remedies including injunctive relief, public vindication, and formal discipline or termination of those who engaged in retaliation, misclassification, if Renfro does nothing to actually remedy the matter fully not limited to formally reprimanding and or asking employees to sign sworn statements or admit fault or be terminated for refusal of making sworn statements or attending a formal HR hearing if they make claims such as, “not remembering”.  


I reserve my First Amendment right to present these concerns to the public, including at City Council meetings and through outreach to journalists, advocacy organizations, regulatory authorities and elected officials.


My recent assistance in felony matters including a May 14, 2025 aggravated assault with a deadly weapon (Case No. 191629201010) and a May 12, 2025 animal cruelty investigation (Case No. 2025050151) are true demonstrates my credibility, moral responsibility, and ongoing contribution to public safety.


25. I swear, under penalty of aggravated perjury, that every statement in this affidavit is true, accurate and based on my personal knowledge. This document serves as formal notice to all parties of the seriousness of the harms inflicted upon me and my rights and legal intent if no adequate redress is made.
In addition, I have the legal right and full intent to submit Public Information Act requests under the Texas Public Information Act (TPIA) and Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to obtain documentation relevant to these claims. This includes, but is not limited to:
Contracts and payment records between Renfro and public agencies;


Any complaints, violations, citations, or audit findings;


Records that may indicate Renfro has received taxpayer-funded contracts while concurrently misclassifying workers or violating employment laws.


Any such records will be reviewed, preserved, and submitted (along with this affidavit) to appropriate regulatory and oversight agencies, including:
The Texas Workforce Commission (TWC);


The U.S. Department of Labor;


The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA);


The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Office of Inspector General (HUD OIG);


The Texas Office of the Attorney General (OAG);


The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE);


Relevant agencies and offices within the City of Houston and Harris County.


I also reserve the right to forward this affidavit and its supporting documentation to elected officials, including state representatives, as well as any additional investigative or oversight authority with jurisdiction over labor and civil rights enforcement. If new evidence emerges from these records, I will act accordingly to ensure it is incorporated into future filings and public disclosures.

antiwork,workplace discrimination,Christians.,"I work for a local supplement manufacturing company. During the interview, everything seemed fine and dandy and there was no sign of any sort of Bible belting. Flash forward to when I actually started, day one my car battery died in the parking lot so I was out there past hours getting it fixed. A few days after that, I got introduced to someone, and he asked if I was the one with the car troubles. I said yes and that my battery died and how stressful it all was, and his response was ""Oh I wish I would've caught you so I could pray over it for you."" That's when I realized what kind of place I started working at.

There's quite a few instances of shit like this, but what I heard from my supervisor today took the cake. Last week when I came in on Monday, I went to the break room to put my lunch up like usual, and every Monday they have Bible study in the public breakroom of all places. I'm already uncomfortable walking in every time to begin with, but then my CEO asks me if I wanted to join Bible study after I obviously avoid it every single week. I just say I don't believe in God and walk out. The next day, I went to the breakroom to warm my lunch up, and the dude that leads the Bible study was in there getting coffee. He doesn't even work here. He confronted me about not believing in God and asked if I wanted to talk about it, I said I have religious trauma and immediately get cut off with ""Oh no no no"" and he goes on a whole schpeel about a documentary  with people ""just like me"" and whatever. I was filling my water cup up so I couldn't just walk away, but I tuned out pretty much everything he said after that. When I was done, he asked if I wanted to join something with him and I immediately said no and walked the fuck out before this old man gets punched in his chest. I spent the rest of the week just avoiding as many people as possible.

Now today. I was talking to my supervisor about some things, and I ended up bringing up my issues with all the religious stuff being shoved down my throat. I'm very non-confrontational so bringing up anything makes me nervous, but it is an issue that bothers me almost daily. I told him about the encounter last week. Apparently after that happened, the old dude was trying to talk to my supervisor about it. Thankfully my supervisor isn't pushy and I've already told him about my beliefs, or lack of beliefs, and he's understanding. I guess old dude was telling him I wasn't having any of the god talk. Big deal, get over it. Then I hear that old dude was basically saying it's NOT okay for me to be the way I am. So now I have this old man who doesn't even work here denying my beliefs, and discriminating against me yay!!!

I'm very big on ""to each their own"", I don't care what you believe in as long as you respect others. I am SO. FUCKING. TIRED. of the extreme Christians ALWAYS shoving their beliefs down your throat, and now that I have it at my job, the place I spend most of the waking hours of my life at. I'm aware it's illegal to discriminate against religion in the workplace, I'm working up the courage to do something about it. I would go to HR, but HR is just as preachy as the rest so that trip is basically worthless. Religion does NOT belong in the workplace. I can't wait to leave.",8,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1hhyc7q/christians/,1734629926.0,elvenfuneral,1hhyc7q,advice_seeking
antiwork,workplace discrimination,Venting about my crappy Boss at a small aquarium shop,"So this post will probably be a little all over the place. I am an aquarium hobbyist, and I’ve been in the freshwater side of the hobby for a few years now. Needless to say, while there is always more to learn in this hobby, I have a fair bit of experience and knowledge. So when I got my first ever job at my small, local aquarium that I had been patronizing for awhile by that point, I thought it would be at least a decent fit for me (especially as an autistic person). I am also a transgender man, this will come into play later. So there is my “main” boss and his wife, who is a co-owner and my other boss. I say “main” boss because he tends to handle things regarding my employment more, and other boss tends to defer to him on a lot of things (there is definitely a power dynamic between them). I had an inkling of suspicion that at least “main” boss was conservative, and likely to hold transphobic views. Still, I needed a job. Being a college student, I also needed a job that was very flexible. I also needed a more chill work environment as an autistic person, environments like the ones at most fast food places would likely overstimulate me which cause a meltdown. For those who don’t know, autistic meltdowns are different from tantrums. Main boss also came up to me when I was shopping there one day and asked when he could hire me. So it seemed kinda like a no-brainer to just go work there for a bit. Main boss is expecting me to be working there for about 2 years, it’s only been a couple of months and I am kinda regretting my decision to work there. The place had high turnover rates, and I am now starting to see why. 

So, the workplace culture is fucking awful. Main boss and boss argue in the shop, sometimes even while costumers are there. I have to put on a smile, act like nothing is wrong, and do my best to serve customers while they are audibly arguing in the background. I have had to check a customer out with them arguing right behind me and act like everything was fine. The culture seems to be that if main boss is arguing and upset with someone, to just try and act like it’s ok and keep to your tasks. Main boss honestly belittles other boss. That much was clear when I made a comment about still having “fever brain” (recently got over a fever) after I forgot to give a customer their reciept. She just said, “don’t worry, apparently I have fever brain every day”. She sounded sad when she said that. One of my past coworkers went by he/him pronouns, but seemed to me like he was gender diverse, apparently it seemed that way to my boss as well. When he wasn’t there, he would misgender him. I would gently correct him, but he kept doing anyways and eventually I just gave up. I am not sure if he misgenders me behind my back, he does gender me correctly when I am present. I also present as a more stereotypical guy though. 

One time, when assembling a wooden cabinet, I actually stripped the wood when putting a screw in. It was an honest mistake, and I told my boss about it. My at the time coworker had actually broken part of another stand that day, so he was already frustrated and I was anxious to tell him about my mistake. He belittled me, a lot. He asked if I was trying to get the shop shut down/sabotage him, and if I was an Israeli spy (he is ACTUALLY antisemitic, believes in conspiracy theories about Jewish people). He also said how I was gonna bankrupt the shop, and make him divorce his wife. He also made a comment asking himself why he was paying people to make his life worse.  I did manage to find a way to fix my mistake btw, and it worked. I left that shift feeling so awful about myself, and pretty depressed for the next few days. Anxiety was also killing me every time I would think about work, and especially so on my way to my shift after that one. This incident really affected me mentally. It’s hard for me to not view myself as an employee that is prone to mistakes, which then makes me second guess a lot of things at work and harms my overall performance. I also am now afraid to report even small mistakes. Just today, I accidentally broke a glass drop checked when trying to reattach it to the aquarium wall via the suction cup because I accidentally pressed a little too hard. Instead of reporting the honest mistake, I just immediately tried to cover it up. Main boss was already particularly frustrated with me today because of my perceived “laziness” yesterday. He wanted me to remove duckweed (a floating pest plant) from the DISPLAY tanks, but I didn’t know that. So I removed the small and large from our plant and animal sale tanks, not the display tanks, because I thought he wanted it removed from those tanks. Apparently he also wanted to keep the larger duckweed and berated me for almost eradicating his large duckweed culture (he had previously said it was fine for me to throw some out when I asked about it a month or two ago). Today when I did start removing SMALL duckweed from one of the display tanks he said I didn’t need to because my coworker already did and that we were keeping small duckweed in that specific display tank if customers wanted some (he never told me this). So yeah, got berated for not removing small duckweed from display tanks, later got berated for removing small duckweed from a display tanks. He even berated me for being too slow on cleaning the sponge filters, and said that’s why I wasn’t getting my tasks done. He complained that I was only using one hand. Mind you, I was doing that because the task makes my hands get tired quick, so when one hand tired I could just switch to the other and not have to stop completely for a few second break. He complained about my efficiency. I was literally doing TWO tasks at the same time to try and be more efficient, but he didn’t seem to notice or care. He even at one point said, “wish there was an employee who could help me” after berating me earlier. I was a mental mess and trying to act ok, I really just didn’t know if he was actually asking for my help or just making a comment (his tone seemed somewhat mocking and he wasn’t even looking towards me) so I just stayed quite and focused on my current task. Anyways, when the drop checker broke I was already an anxious mess. I am debating buying a replacement off Amazon (got a gift card recently), hoping it arrives before Tuesday (last shift before surgery), and hoping he doesn’t notice the broken drop checker so I can try and sneakily replace it with a new one. Other boss is more chill, and more approachable, but I am worried that if I tell her it will get back to main boss and I will be belittled or even fired. I’m a people pleaser, and already anxious enough about my job performance and main boss not being happy with me today. The last thing I need is to be belittled more. If I just buy a new one myself and sneakily replace it, hopefully he won’t notice how the glass and suction cup suddenly look a lot newer, and I will have fixed my mistake while avoiding being further belittled. 

This is the part where me being a trans man comes into play. So the aforementioned surgery I am having is top surgery, which is next Thursday. I will be out for 4 weeks minimum (also why I really want the drop checker and solution to get here in time for my Tuesday shift). So you know, I had to inform both bosses I would be having surgery and out for a few weeks. I didn’t directly say what surgery, just that I might have some restrictions on lifting weight, stretching, and lifting my arms above my head for a bit after returning to work. Other boss was chill and didn’t press me for further details. She then brought it up to main boss, and everything went to hell. He started out by asking an invasive question, if I was getting a gynecomastia surgery. I just said something along the lines of not having to tell my private medical information, but that it was to help treat a condition I had. He went on about how there was an anorexia social contagion a few years ago, and then he brought up trans people. I had never told him I was trans, but he figured it out. He kept pressing for more information about my condition. I gave a little and said it was a hormonal condition, hoping he would just leave it at that. He didn’t. He asked if I was taking hormone medication. At one point he even asked if I had a penis. I just kept asserting for the most part that I was a guy (I never mentioned being trans) and had a condition I was being treated for. I tried to be as non-confrontational as possible because I didn’t want to make things worse. I was so anxious during this whole thing, and shaking a little at one point. I made it clear multiple times I was uncomfortable with this conversation but he just kept going. He said that as a “mentor” to me he had to help steer me away from bad decisions, and that he’d be “fine” if I waited until I was 20 or 21 to get top surgery. He asked if I had a chest binder, and went on to say that I already had a flat chest as is (chest binding is a pain in the ass for me, it is just better than a regular bra). He brought up how God condemns being trans. I am a Christian as well, and middle school me was terrified of hell because I used to think it was sinful to be LGBTQ+. I went through a long and hard journey of reconciling my faith and identity, and came out stronger because of it. I know a lot about the theology around LGBTQ+ issues and Christianity. I am not afraid of hell anymore, and I don’t think it is a sin. I am very thankful younger me went through that journey because when my boss brought it up, I was mentally able to fall back on everything I had learned to remind myself that he was wrong. Those comments may have affected me more if I didn’t have that prior knowledge. He also asked if I had any plans for future surgeries, and compared gender affirming healthcare to getting a tattoo (in the aspect of regret). Other boss was there during this entire thing, but stayed quiet and focused on her work just as I did when they argued. This only stopped when a customer that was a friend of main boss came in. I just went to the back while they talked politics and bitcoin (overheard antisemitic rhetoric, pro-Dump stuff, Main boss likes bitcoin). I couldn’t wait to clock out that shift, it was so uncomfortable. 

So I still live with my parents because I am in college and can’t afford to move out (especially with my exotic pets). They are also transphobic Trumpers. Not sure if it is the same elsewhere in the U.S., there are protections specifically for transgender employees. In fact main boss had a poster on a door that specifically addressed the rights of trans employees, and said to not do what he did. I did tell my parents though. Even if they aren’t very pro-trans, I figured they would at least be on my side about main boss clearly overstepping boundaries and asking extremely inappropriate questions. While they did say what he did was wrong, they also discouraged me from reporting it. I’m not stupid, I likely won’t report it until I’ve got a new job (currently there is a 3 year statute for reporting violations) because I know main boss will easily figure out who made that report if it ever gets around to him. That could mean some serious consequences for me at work. That being said, it still baffled me that they actively discouraged even considering making a report. Me and my dad got into a huge argument over this, and one of his text messages was telling me to think about main boss, his family, his business, and how reporting this could harm them. Main boss discriminated directly against me and even asked if I had a penis, and my dad was telling me to think about how my report could hurt him. I just lost it after that. My dad also constantly oversteps and disrespects my boundaries though, so I guess I shouldn’t have expected him to be on my side here. 

Anyways, I guess I thought you guys might be able to give me some advice here, or at least understand me more. I really don’t want to burn the bridge with my workplace, especially since I do get a lot of supplies for my own aquariums there, but I might have too. There’s another small aquarium shop in my area. It’s a farther commute, but might still be a viable option for a future job. The turnover rate there definitely is not as high as my workplace. I even talked with one of the employees there last time I went and they had a lot more good things to say about working there than I did with my workplace. He also said that a past employee actually came to work for them after quitting at my workplace, so I wouldn’t be the first one to go there after working at my current shop. That shop seems pretty well staffed though, so I’m not sure if they are even looking for any new hires. Not sure what I could offer that someone else can’t do better. I am also not sure about the flexibility either. I NEED a job with very flexible hours because of college, and main boss gives me a ton of flexibility.

antiwork,microaggressions colleague,Stuck in Corporate? Here’s How I Preserved My Energy and Took Back My Power,"I know that some of us are still stuck in corporate.

As a Black woman in my early 20s, I’ve only ever worked in corporate jobs and internships. I was the overachiever, the high performer, the one people looked to for results. And yet, despite my success, I’m no stranger to microaggressions and straight-up racism in the workplace(pet to threat pipeline) —from colleagues, managers, and even clients.

At my core I'm super eccentric and quirky and love to dress up. I am usually bubbly and upbeat however working in corporate I struggled with the constant need to prove myself, to “tone it down” so I wouldn’t come off as “too much,” was exhausting.  I was constantly tiptoeing around egos.

I’ve experienced being praised for my energy and ideas, only to have those same qualities used against me when I became a “threat.” It felt like the game was rigged, designed to make me shrink rather than shine.

If this resonates with you, I want you to know: you’re not crazy, and you’re not alone.

Here are three things I did to preserve my energy in corporate and reclaim my power:

# 1. You Don’t Owe Anyone Help

It might sound harsh, but hear me out. If you and your coworker are on the same level, remember: as soon as an opportunity comes up, you’re competition. It’s not personal—it’s just the way the system is set up.

I’ve seen how lending a hand to the wrong person can backfire. They’ll take credit for your work, use your kindness to get ahead, or even throw you under the bus when it’s convenient. And the system rewards it.

Here’s what I learned:

* **Be self-preserving: ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE A BLACK WOMAN** Don’t overextend yourself to help someone who wouldn’t do the same for you.
* **Stay strategic:** Protect your time and energy for the things that advance your own goals.
* **Choose your allies carefully:** Build genuine connections, but don’t confuse friendship with strategy.

This isn’t about being cold or selfish—it’s about survival in a system that isn’t always fair. Once I realized this, I stopped feeling guilty for putting myself first and started moving with intention.   

# 2. Creatives: Use Your Lunch Break Wisely

If you're creative, use that lunch break to work on your passions. Whether it’s a poem, a song, or even a business idea, carve out that time to feed your dreams.

Corporate life can be soul-sucking if you let it, but it doesn’t have to consume all of you. That hour (or 30 minutes) can be your sacred time to invest in yourself. 

In all honesty, some of my best writing, and production has come from my time in corporate. think of yourself as a caged bird. most likely your brain is under stimulated . your art will represent the color you are longing for 

# 3. Start Your Exit Plan on Day One

For early professionals: The moment you set foot in that job, start working on your exit plan.

Too often, I see bright, ambitious people say things like, *“I’m going to work here for X amount of time, and then when I \[insert arbitrary milestone\], I’ll quit.”* But what happens? They get comfortable. A promotion comes up. Life gets in the way. Before they know it, they’re the crabby old coworker in the office.

Don’t think those older coworkers didn’t have dreams like yours. They probably came into corporate with big plans too. The only difference? They probably prioritized conformity over their own freedom .

Here’s what I mean: Start building your way out now. Invest in your skills, passions, and side hustles while you still have the safety net of a paycheck. Don’t wait until you feel “ready”—start where you are. 

  
If any of this resonates with you, I’d love to hear your thoughts. What’s been your biggest challenge in corporate? How are you preserving your energy or planning your next move? Let’s build each other up! If you would like to connect feel free to PM me!

antiwork,ask for a raise,"I’m the sole Python developer and Cloud Engineer at this company on an entry-level salary, I asked for a raise and my boss threatened to “replace” me with Gen AI","I started at this small marketing agency shortly after I graduated from university, they offered me £32k a year while claiming that I stood out as a “key hire” for their new data team, which they planned to expand. Initially, a junior analyst was hired too, so *initially* I wasn’t the only python programmer. But she was made redundant after a few months when the agency lost a major client. 

Consequently, I was fully alone in handling the data warehouse and doing a project my boss was very keen on. Once there were signs of an MVP, he started pressuring me and was convinced it was a “groundbreaking” tool for the industry. 

Under pressure, knowing that i could potentially leave and secure a better job as soon as i delivered it and could put in my CV, I stayed for several more months to manage the tool. The initial release was functional but had some bugs, (especially when running in the cloud on large websites) so sometimes it required manual wrangling and recoding / editing the main script. 

While dealing with this stuff, Cursor was released and my boss went from fake nice to constantly negging and making subtle threats to me about how good at coding it is. Even after the release of our product and them selling it to a few players, I did not receive a raise or reward of any kind. Obviously, this further proved to me that I needed to find a new/better job. 

I was managing this job while applying for jobs, but then I fell sick and was diagnosed with IBS.  

Eventually (having been at the agency for over 18 months atp) I found the courage to ask for a raise, as well as a proper review (my previous annual review involved him making vocal/empty promises and deliberately not writing anything down or recording them in bob) and my boss’ reaction was atrocious. 

He started venting about how he doesn’t like that i’m always “fixing” and “redoing” things. He proceeded to go on about new AI tools and how “fast” everything is moving and said he wanted to start deploying AI agents across the agency. He then also asked me to write a list of steps needed to make the product i built for them in the cloud “90% self-sufficient” as well as a timeline for it. 

I resigned the next day, I just couldn’t do it anymore. The anxiety. His irrationality. His subtle racist microagressions. My deteriorating sleep and health. The cognitive overload of the role compared to the actual compensation. I’m interviewing at other places now but also processing this experience and…

I can’t believe this happened to me. 

**UPDATE**:

**My last day is next week and this morning he messaged me for an update on “progress on completing the outstanding bug fixes on (Product Name)” as well as “Documentation on everything including [other scripts I worked on during my tenure].**

antiwork,ask for a raise,"Received an email praising my work, fired not even an hour later after 3 years.","I just wanted a place to vent. 

I was at this company for 3 years next month. I have not once gotten a raise from them and they’ve kept me overnights the whole time, when I’ve mentioned moving to days. 

Long story short, today when I got that email, I asked if there is anyway to possibly be compensated with a raise, since I haven’t had one my whole duration there. 

They called me after that and said the new manager, (golf buddies with the owner) stated that last night, I cursed a client out over the phone, which absolutley didn’t happen, and they fired me.

Asked for proof, as they record calls, which I know since in the past, they’ve sent me calls to listen to, so I’d be able to know more, before getting into a clients case.

They hung up on me. 

Don’t trust any of these people guys, cause I’ve learned firsthand, they don’t care about you. 


***UPDATE***

Owner just called me, they don’t have the phone call to give me, says how amazing of an employee I was and that I have a great future in this business, just not at his place.

I was a college dropout with surprise twin girls on the way. I didn't know what I want in a career but I knew I had to work my ass off for these kids coming up.  

I had a life changing interview that put me in the right place at the right time for growth. Leadership recognized me and rewarded me.

I started out at a floor level position and within 6 years I was promoted 4 times to District Manager. 

About 2 years in, the Company decided to do away with Auto Allowances and give us company cars and also unlimited personal mileage use. Pretty neat perk. 

During covid, I had the best staffing levels in the division and I was asked to move into a new position that was based out of home but was essentially 90% work from home. Boss even said I could keep the car.

2025, CFO takes away all the Company cars from anyone driving less than x amount of miles per month for business and gives no salary increases to comp them. I valued this benefit at approximately 10k per year. So after my 2.1k increase, I am now set back THREE YEARS IN PAY INCREASES!

To add insult to injury, they tell me this at my performance review. I obviously got upset and explained how removing this benefit was equivalent to a huge pay cut for me.

Had a follow up conversation today where they told me to look forward to a new job being posted. I asked what the pay raise would be and it was literally exactly the amount I just lost. They also had the nerve to scold me about my 'unprofessionalism.'

I started part-time at [logistics company], working full-time hours anyway. Took a QA Admin position and got a $1 raise. Wasn’t eligible for the annual raise last October because of an HR system migration “technicality.” No raise since.

Now I’m officially full-time as an Ops Admin II on the Outbound side. Sounds good, right? Not really. It’s a lateral move, so again — no raise. I even asked if the additional responsibilities mattered. “Nope.”

And here’s the kicker: we’ve now merged with [logistics company, same company], so I have to learn a whole new side of the business — new systems, codes, procedures, etc. Oh, and I’m about to attend a full week of Dangerous Goods training so I can become the certified specialist for our station — including hazmat spill cleanup.

I brought this all up. I wrote an actual salary negotiation document with market data, my certifications, and the value I bring. I’ve taken initiative, documented discrepancies, and made it clear that I’m underpaid. Took it to my SR HR Business Partner, then escalated to District HR.

Their response?
“Wait until October.”
That’ll be two full years without a raise.

And it’s not like I’m new to work. I’ve worked customer support, tech, warehouse, driving, team leadership. I document processes, help train others, clean up literal messes — including jumping into a trailer full of spilled white paint to save packages. I’m certified in multiple FedEx internal systems. I’m the guy who quietly keeps things moving while others let it fall apart.

I’m not asking for a miracle. Just a wage that reflects the work I actually do. But apparently showing up, speaking up, and stepping up isn’t enough unless it’s October.

antiwork,negotiate salary,"I quit the job for safety reasons, then my replacement got killed","I just posted this as an answer in r/AskReddit, but then realized this needs to be posted here, as I haven't publicly shared this story before today.

I once chose a career that was paid shit for money, but I loved what I did. Unfortunately it ended up badly with miserable working conditions, toxic workplace, and two dead bodies.

I first decided to quit my decently paid job at that time (finishing carpenter) and become a tandem hang glider instructor instead. I was already a hang glider pilot at that time, even taught flying part-time for a year, and flew every weekend as a leisurely activity to help me relax and recharge. I was in my twenties and becoming a full-time instructor was my dream.

I got a job at a local hang gliding school, so I moved myself, and my very accommodating and understanding wife, to a place close to the flight park.

The school was already facing some financial hardships when I joined, and it became apparent that the ownership was cutting corners wherever they could. I was on salary, and expected to work long hours without extra compensation when it got busy.

This wasn't a big deal on most days since I really enjoyed the work, but I recall examples such as when I ended up staying hooked into the glider for 10 hours straight without a break, taking passengers one after another. And this was after already working 4 hours prior on non-flying tasks earlier that day. My shoulders and neck were in pain for days after, but I couldn't take time off to recoup.

There were also frequent issues with one of the owners. His personality was a passive-aggressive type, and it became a big issue at the flight park. He was never the kind to say what was in his mind, but would find ways to make you feel it in a way you couldn't discuss it. 

The toxicity made me consider leaving a few times, but it all came to a head after an incident which made me realize that my safety, and the safety of my students, was becoming a serious issue. Little did I know that this decision would ultimately save my life, but cost the lives of two other people.

You see, most people think of hang gliders as aircraft that are foot-launched off the side of a mountain. This is true for a lot of solo hang glider pilots, but as a flight school we were using something called air tow to get the hang gliders into the air. 

Similar to towing ordinary gliders, there is a powered aircraft at the front (in this case an ultralight specifically designed for towing hang gliders), that pulls hang gliders along to the desired altitude. Once there the glider releases, and the tug (what we call the ultralight) goes back down to pick up the next tow. This allows for way more flights in a day as one doesn't need to break down the glider, drive back up the mountain, reassemble, etc...

This tow rig typically utilizes two weak links, one at each end of the tow line, designed to break after a specific tow pressure is exceeded. This is done for safety as it mitigates the effect of a lockout, which is an involuntary manoeuvre that can put a hang glider into an uncontrolled nose dive, and even stall the tow aircraft. During a lockout, the tension on a tow line is very rapidly increased, hence utilizing weak links designed to break before the lockout becomes a threat.

In an ideal world, you would toss a weak link out after every tow and replace it with a fresh one. But when it got busy at the flight park, the extra time required to do this swap meant fewer tows in a day, which meant fewer bucks for the school. 

The owner often reused weak links until they started to show signs of wear. Now, this isn't a big deal on its own, as it merely increases the chance of a premature weak link failure. But it also entails that students be trained in case of weak link failures.

When a weak link breaks, there is a sudden loss of thrust and therefore climb. On a hang glider this results in a brief parabolic trajectory, similar to the zero-g airplane flights, albeit on a much smaller scale. The low-g event is brief and lasts maybe 1-2 seconds, but since the drastic change in wing loading is experienced as a momentary loss of control, it was my job to train new pilots how to deal with this situation without going haywire.

In essence, when there is loss of control, untrained pilots tend to increase their control inputs, which end up becoming too great as soon as the wing loading returns to normal, and this leads to an erratic flight path. This is similar to a loss of control experienced due to oversteering on slippery roads. 

The solution is to overcome the instinct to make any and all control inputs for a brief second or two, and then make the normal inputs as soon as the wing loading returns to normal. And to do that, I would teach the theory of dealing with it first, then simulate the link failure by occasionally and unexpectedly hitting a tow line release while under tow (always when high up near the end of the tow, to provide ample recovery altitude).

The goal was to experience the link failure event enough times under training to get students used to the sudden jerk, prevent the instinctual tensing up, and ending up in PIOs (pilot-induced oscillations).

The owner, who was also the tug pilot, didn't like the sudden jerk he would experience when this was done, and after much resistance on my part, he simply forbade me from doing the practical part of the weak link failure training.

The result was that my very next student was inexperienced in this scenario, and when the weak link broke during his very first solo flight, he ended up overcontrolling the glider into the trees.

He was ok, just had minor bruises and scuffs.

My initial elation quickly turned into anger as this could have ended way worse. And if I were only allowed to train this guy to begin with, this clearly could have been avoided. So I went back to the owner expecting that now, surely he would see the sense in resuming the practical weak-link failure training. 

He said no. 

He said the cost of fuel was too great to waste a hundred or so feet of altitude on weak link training.

I called my previous job manager and they were still hiring my replacement. I quit what was my dream job on the spot and went back to my old job.

Unfortunately that's not where the story ends.

The person who replaced me at the flight park, died the following season, along with the passenger he was with. And I'm very sad to say, it was in part because I wasn't there to do anything about... maybe at least channelling the cost-cutting, which continued after my departure. Maybe I would have been able to negotiate where the costs could be cut in a safer manner.

While I was still at the park, before I had quit, I noticed that the tandem glider was starting to show signs of over-UV. To explain, modern hang gliders are built tough - they are certified for at least 6 G's of force, and can do amazing aerial feats (current world record for consecutive loops is 95 in a row, greatest single-flight distance is 764 Km or 475 miles, etc). 

They can clearly take a lot of beating, but the one thing that damages them is solar radiation. A sail on a hang glider can only take so much UV before it degrades past its certification point.

And so, when I noticed that the tandem glider sail was getting past its prime, I brought it up with the owner.

He said no bueno, but assured me that he would look into it at the end of the season when there was more cash in the bank. 

The sail was faded but I felt I was still ok to fly it at the time, so I didn't press it further. As long as the sail was to be replaced as promised, everything would be ok.

As it happened, I had quit before the end of the season, and the guy who got my job didn't know anything about this.

Halfway through the following season, the sail blew open while under tow, and the glider crashed, killing the instructor and the student.

The instructor deployed the emergency parachute (on hang gliders, the chute is designed to bring both people and the aircraft down under one canopy), but they were too low for this. After the scene investigation, it was determined that the chute was deployed roughly at treetop height, which is way too low for the chute to deploy safely.

If I hadn't quit for the reasons I did, maybe I would have quit later due to the sail not being airworthy, or maybe my pressure to replace the sail would have resulted in its replacement. Heck, maybe I would have even caved in to a pressure to continue flying it again - I'm not sure. But as it is now, two people are dead and the school had to close down.

The owner was never sued, although my understanding is that the family of the deceased student was discussing it at the time.

antiwork,negotiate salary,Should I Expose the Pay Gap in my Company Before Resigning?,"I’m going to be resigning from my job soon. I work in a company that is small staff wise but is fairly large revenue wise. I’m leaving because I don’t agree with the owners and have been trying to improve the employee conditions. After the two owners I am the most senior employee in the company.

That being said, in my opinion it is gross the pay gap between the owners and the employees. Each of them are earning at least x15 the average salary of the employees. To some this may not seem that bad, but the way the company treats the people who actually do the work is awful. There are no medical benefits, profit sharing, or retirement programs. Most workers go 3-5 years without raises. PTO is on average 5 days a years. And salaries are below the industry standard. What frustrates me is that the company could treat the employees better with a negligible impact to the owners’ profit. 100k a year given via salary increase or additional benefits would barely be noticeable to them but would mean a lot to the other employees. And worst of all, the company basically runs itself without the owners. 

I was recruited to the company and was able to negotiate for a decent salary and benefits but I am the exception. I’ve tried to get the owners to do better but I always land on deaf ears. I’m not willing to work hard for years without being reward. 

Was driven me to leave is I beginning to feel my future is being jeopardized by the owners’ greed.

I’m new to a hiring manager role, and I’m finding salary negotiations to be one of the toughest parts of the job. I want to make sure I’m being fair and transparent with candidates while still staying within my budget and not giving up too much too quickly.

I’ve already noticed how easy it can be to feel pressured, especially when candidates are strong negotiators or come with competing offers. I want to strike the right balance between being accommodating and holding firm when necessary, but I’m not sure the best way to approach it.

Here are a few things I’ve been wondering:

* Is it worth competing with the candidates other job offers or will I give up too much?
* How do I set boundaries without coming across as rigid or dismissive?
* What’s the best way to explain budget constraints to candidates without killing the relationship?
* Are there specific tactics or phrases I can use to navigate pushback from candidates?
* How do I avoid the mistake of making a concession I’ll regret later?

I’d love to hear from other hiring managers and your conflicting opinions or anyone who’s been on the other side of the table about strategies or lessons you’ve learned. How do you manage these conversations while staying professional and fair to these young professionals?

antiwork,promotion advice,"Feeling Stuck in Sales, Valued but Not Promoted — Growth Advice or Exit Strategy by EOY?","Hey sales community,
I’ve been in my current role as an Account Manager for about three years now at a service-based company. I’ve been consistently hitting goals, taking initiative on things no one asked for (but definitely needed), and building systems that support both sales and operations.

Here’s the thing that’s wearing on me:
My direct supervisor — let’s call him “Alan” — has been with the company 7+ years. He’s not exactly toxic, but he’s deeply resistant to change and tends to redirect or dismiss valid ideas that don’t come from him. A few times now in team meetings (including in front of leadership), he’s shot down suggestions I’ve made that would improve transparency or accountability, like better tracking of contract usage.

Every time this happens, I feel anxious — physically shaky even — and like I’m fighting for progress that others around me don’t want to acknowledge. To be clear, leadership does seem to agree with some of the changes I propose, but Alan always circles back with the CEO privately after tense meetings. It’s like he tries to justify himself behind closed doors.

Meanwhile, a consultant working with our team seems to be rooting for me. She’s asked me to take lead on creating a sales competency matrix — something I would have expected HR or an executive to handle. I’m honored, but also wondering why me? Is it trust? Is it grooming me for something more? Or just delegation?

Some context on value:
	•	I bring in consistent revenue and even helped generate $25K in new business last year (at a strong margin).
	•	I get along with the broader team and clients, and I’ve never had issues with quality, follow-through, or collaboration.
	•	My compensation is decent (~$60K base + small bonuses), but others in similar roles in the industry have grown into more strategic positions while I feel like I’m stagnating.
	•	We recently had a high-level exec let go for bad behavior. I thought that might shake things up, but so far, things feel… the same.

Here’s what I’m struggling with:
	•	I want to grow — ideally into a more strategic role where I can focus on impact and leadership. But I don’t know if that path is through this company or outside it.
	•	I don’t want to “fight” my way into leadership. I want to earn it through results and collaboration, but it feels like internal politics are holding me back.
	•	I know I bring value. But sometimes I feel invisible because I’m not loud or self-promotional like others.

I’m trying to make a call by end of year (EOY):
Do I stay and push for a new title/responsibility — or do I build my exit plan now and pivot into something more fulfilling?

So here’s where I’d love your thoughts:
	1.	How have you navigated a leadership bottleneck like “Alan”? Any tips on being heard without creating friction?
	2.	Is it possible the consultant sees me as a future leader — or should I be cautious of being handed more work without career movement?
	3.	What would you prioritize in my shoes — internal growth or external pivot?
	4.	If I decide to exit, what’s one thing you wish you had done before making the jump?

Appreciate you reading this far. Just trying to find clarity and not let burnout or resentment steer the wheel.

Cut to today, I get a phone call from that business owner asking me what the deal with my review is, and to take the review down, and a bunch of excuses about why things happened.  He claims he had interviewed 50-60 people and a lot of people just had similar ideas, including the person he DID end up hiring.  50-60 people all just had... The same exact ideas, and suggested the same companies and products... Ok, sure.  I guess that's not entirely impossible... He also said I was ""in the top 3"" and that he ended up going local because they were already there and could start immediately... Except hey remember like 4 sentences ago when I said he told me he hired someone else for being cheaper?  So which is it?  Did you hire someone cheaper, or hire because they were local?  Also hey, better and more important question, how the F\*CK did you know it my MY google account when it was brand new, completely blank, and in the name I LITERALLY put ""Anon""?

  
OOPS.  Did I just... Catch you in an absolutely blatant lie?  Did you just admit to the person you stole from that you stole from them because you knew FULL WELL who you were stealing from, but didn't care?  Or are you just calling all 50-60 people you lied about interviewing to accuse every single one of them to see who reacts?  Cus that seems like a TON of work for nothing.

  
It is bizarre, absolutely WILD, insane to me that anyone can be this dumb.  Now I told them I was going to email them, and I intend to basically call them out on it.  But not really sure what to say to them, they want to review taken down, which I will not be doing, and have chosen to put my name into their response to my review, which only further proves they KNEW they were stealing my ideas.  So I am curious what people think I should say/do here.  And if I should be calling them out more directly instead of what I am doing.

  
Also hilariously their response to using AI art was, and I will quote it directly here: ""As for the mention of AI art in our ads, I strive to use a variety of creative tools to promote {Store name}, and I’m committed to being transparent and ethical in our marketing efforts. If you have specific concerns, I’d be happy to discuss them further.""

  
If you were concerned about being ethical you wouldn't be using AI art my dude.  Just a wild thing to say here.

antiwork,promotion advice,"Company fired my supervisor for being trans, now they’re dumping extra work on me. Advice?","I work at a drug testing company, and recently my supervisor (who is trans FTM) was fired. From what I understand, they were let go because the company didn’t want them drug testing male clients, despite them being male.
After they were fired, someone from Community Corrections mentioned that clients were rescheduled on their workdays, which left me with more patient’s on my days. I was told from someone at Community Corrections that they were discussing this between them (CC), probation, the local court system, and the company I work for.  Now that they’re gone, I’ve been given extra responsibilities, like training/setting up new hires, keeping track of stock, etc. without a raise or promotion.
I feel like I’m being unfairly overworked because of my supervisor’s firing, which was likely discriminatory. I’ve thought about going to HR, but my company doesn’t seem to listen well, and I worry they’ll just brush me off.
Should I tell my former supervisor what I’ve learned? From what HR told them, they were “removed by the customer,” but it seems like there’s more to the story.
Do I have any legal options here? Does my supervisor? Would filing a complaint with the EEOC help? Or should I approach this differently?
Ask questions if you need more information—I’m trying to be vague to avoid any issues at my work.

antiwork,promotion advice,Boss keeps asking me to work with him in his office.,"Exactly as the title says. I (46F) has been asked for the past two days to work in his (57M) office with him. For context I am his administrative assistant and I manage the office. I have many more duties than just assisting him with his duties. 

He requires me to have a meeting every single day with him in his office which is around 1 hour each day. This is non-negotiable to him. I have mentioned that the time from my schedule to sit in his office is affecting my productivity. We also have weekly budget meetings that are just he and I. A total of about 5-6 hours in his office each week, door shut due to confidentiality of the material. 

I do not feel comfortable spending any more time in his office. I have so much to do. I work at an elementary school, I have staff payroll, enrollment, data systems upkeep, budget, purchasing, the updating website, the master calendars and so much more to handle. 

He can see me from his office as he never sits at his desk and instead sits where he has eyes on me. I turned my desk around 90 degrees to help with the constant uncomfortable eye contact. He can hear every word I say, I can hear him and answer to his questions while sitting at my desk. It’s a tiny office at a Title 1 school. 

Please help me out here, is this weird? Does this sound uncomfortable? Is this enough of uncomfortablity to make a complaint without looking like a complete A-hole? 

For the record this is my first year working for him at this school. My last school did not operate like this. I have  applied for a promotional position for next school year. But will be staying here if I don’t get it. I want to make the most of this.

antiwork,promotion advice,Physically assaulted at work. Made out to be the villian. No help or support from the company. ,"I need help.

I currently work in a UK company as a Managing Director. I have worked at the business for over 7 years. I started as an apprentice in 2017 and worked my way up to being a director through a lot of hard work and eventually bought into the business in 2021.

The company was then acquired by a group in December 2022 after 10 months of the due diligence process. The whole process of the buyout was handled by the major directors/shareholders of the group and the managing director of our business at the time who towards the end didn't have the best relationship with me and the whole purpose of the acquisition was for him to part ways with the business. I was perhaps in 1 meeting with the new owners that were taking over throughout the 10-month process.

We had been given an offer, sent to us via email, which we verbally accepted. I was supposed to receive 5% shares in the deal as was one of my colleagues, however, 1 or 2 weeks before the deal was finalised the group company decided they wanted to remove me as a director of the business and reduce my shareholding to 3% in the deal without increasing my pay out for taking on less shares after they bought out my shares for the same price as my colleague. This was all done for no reason, and to this day I have never been given an explanation as to why as they did this, and I still haven’t got an answer. My colleague received the same sum of money and more shares and got to remain as a director on companies’ house.

I was given a contract with the role of commercial manager because they did not know what to do with me. They appointed a new managing director to take over who quickly established I was crucial to the business and understood I was frustrated about my position. Within 1 or 2 months of her being appointed I became a director again by title only, they did not give me a new contract or pay rise but was addressed to me by email that as of that day I was appointed as commercial director and that I would also receive my remaining 2% shares by the end of the year, that was in October 2023 and we are now November 2024 and I have not received these shares or had any conversations about them. I was specifically told by the chief operations officer not to bring it up to the CEO as it is a sensitive subject and that they had all not received their group shares yet which are worth a lot more then mine.

By December 2023 the previous managing director and the operations manager that she appointed had both been dismissed/resigned after achieving really poor turnover plus additional problems such as morale being an all time low. They were given a 45 days by the COO to turn it around and they did not manage to do so. Part of their issue is that they would not work with myself or the technical director when we tried helping and giving advice.

I stepped in off my own back and took control to steady the ship and by doing so I took the company from a very dark place to better then it ever was. Immeditely, we flipped the poor turnover, and we were hitting all targets and making much more profit then what the group had budgeted for. I was appointed Interim Managing Director in January and given the position permanently at the end of March or beginning of April. Originally it was requested by the Chief Operations Officer that I become Operations Director as he didn’t want a Managing Director on the sites, but this was overruled by the CEO and CFO who agreed at the time I should be given the title of Managing Director since I had done such a great job. I was still never given a new contract after I requested one multiple times to multiple members of the group. They advised I didn’t need a new contract but the COO advised I would receive private healthcare etc as a minimum but this never happened, they kept me on the commercial manager contract.

We achieved success for 6 months straight with morale higher than ever, I even have private messages from one of the managers stating this is the best the company has been in over 7 years and they appreciate the support I give them so much. We were having pizza or subway parties every month for the whole factory all together to celebrate hitting targets which we had never done before. I personally took all the managers out for meal, drinks and axe throwing out of my own pocket to celebrate their achievements and improve team morale.

That was until the chief operations officer decided he wanted someone with the title operations manager to work under him on all the sites. He brought in someone as the operations manager to my business who within the first week handed in his notice and said that he couldn’t work with me. The COO wanted me to talk him into staying which I did reluctantly.

I tried working with this man but it constantly felt like he was struggling with the age gap between us (I’m 29 and he’s 60) and he was constantly undermining my authority and freezing me out, turning managers against me. Within a month he handed in his notice again and specifically set up a meeting with the CEO and the COO.

After they had their meeting, which I had no involvement in they kept me in the dark. It seemed that the Operations Manager was staying and that he had made some private agreements with them which I wasn’t aware of. It then transpired that they promoted the Operations Manager to become Plant Manager and have full control of the factory and report solely to the COO, cutting me out. I was then asked by the COO if I could temporarily turn all of my focus to the struggling sales department and let the Plant Manager take over and the COO stated he would be on site daily to manage the Plant Manager. The COO didn’t end up coming in at all.

A notice was then sent out to all managers by the COO indicating that they now all report to the new plant manager and that I am specifically only going to focus on sales going forward. This has made the whole company think I have been demoted as MD and that the plant manager is now my boss. I was told specifically by the COO that this was a short-term thing but indicated to everyone and then later confirmed to me that it is in fact not temporary but will be permanent and advised that I need to suck it up referring to my ego when I addressed how I felt about it in a meeting. The CEO would then do visits to the business and have walkarounds with the plant manager and speak to others in the business but never made any time for me, unfortunately it always clashed with another meeting he had when we were due to catch up.

Between the new plant manager, the gatehouse manager and the production manager, none of them specifically cared about the business and were more then happy to send out terrible quality products damaging our reputation we worked so hard for. They would also blame the commercial and technical department for every fault of the business and accept no fault of their own, this caused a huge divide between the departments and I flagged this on numerous occasions as we have had scathing reports back from customers regarding quality and rework levels went through the roof. The managers were not happy that I was not allowing the standards to drop but in their eyes, they no longer had to answer to me as they thought the plant manager was the overall boss who decided so they turned on me.

3 weeks ago, I was physically assaulted by the plant manager. After I swore regarding the poor quality of a product that was about to go out the next day (not aimed at the plant manager specifically) he followed me outside and punched me numerous times in a state of rage.

I reported this immediately to group and it took hours for them to get back to me as they were all in meetings and I was left on site alone after the incident. I was given no instruction other then do not go to the office on Monday but don’t worry I’ve not done anything wrong, the CEO had tried making contact with the attacker but not myself over that weekend to check in to see how I was doing.

On Monday morning I went to the separate office and was asked to prepare a statement. I had only seen the group commercial director at this point, no one else had come to see or speak to me. He then told me that unfortunately he was told by HR that I am suspended and I need to hand in my phone, laptop, keys etc and I was very upset about the situation as no one has talked me through it or advised any timescales.

That day I get an email inviting me to a teams meeting on the Tuesday for around midday which I attended to advise the HR lead how in my opinion this all came about. They then left me in silence suspended for 3 weeks after telling me the investigation should only take a matter of days during the meeting. I was so anxious as I’m not allowed to talk to any colleagues about the situation.

So after 3 weeks I receive an email saying I need to attend a teams meeting within a few hours time giving me little to no notice as there is now a new investigation being carried out as several managers who worked directly and very closely with the plant manager are making ludicrous allegations of bullying and poor conduct with very very far fetched statements which are not true.

Having had the teams meeting, before the COO has even received my minutes he has arranged for a disciplinary meeting for me off site in a location which is known only for dismissals in 1.5 days time. I have been given 5 statements who are all part of the same close friendship group that have been making me feel uncomfortable for months all making up ridiculous lies comparing me to Hitler in some cases. All of these allegations could not be further from the truth but are seemingly being believed by HR and the COO.

I’m being treated extremely unfairly here and they have blackmailed the company in their statements saying that they will all leave the business if I come back. I have evidence completely disproving what one of the managers is saying who is conveniently in a relationship with one of the other managers conspiring against me, the same person messaging me saying it’s the best the company has been in over 7 years is saying to HR that for over a year they have been working in tyranny which is flat out lies. I also have numerous members of staff that would be able to vouch to say those statements are complete and utter lies but as I am suspended at this time I am not allowed to interact with any members of staff. I asked for HR to carry out statements that weren’t one sided but it doesn’t look like they are going to do this.

The disciplinary meeting is tomorrow and they clearly have an agenda set, they only advised the meeting was going to be taking place yesterday and they have only just sent me over all the reports and statements to go through giving me extremely little time.

What should I do?

antiwork,promotion advice,Am I experiencing workplace retaliation after a report was filed?,"Hey everyone, I’ve been working in retail for a little while now, and I wanted to ask for some outside perspective on something that’s been bothering me. I believe I may be experiencing retaliation from my employer after a report was filed against them (not by me directly, but someone close to me made the report based on things coworkers had shared).

Since then, the atmosphere at work has gotten weirdly hostile and passive-aggressive. Here are some things I’ve documented so far:

	•	I was sent a picture of myself just sipping a drink I bought during my shift, captioned something like “this is what corporate sees.” I wasn’t on my phone or doing anything wrong.
	•	I noticed that my manager was watching and seemingly taking pictures of me through the office cameras when I walked into the office area.
	•	One morning, they dumped a bunch of disorganized store materials (hangers, shelf ribbons, etc.) all over the floor for me to clean. Then insisted I go do another task while I was still cleaning the mess they made.
	•	I’ve been told that I’m required to sell a set amount of promotional items per shift. These are add-ons at checkout, and I can’t force customers to buy them. It feels like an unreasonable and arbitrary quota.
	•	I was also told not to take regular bathroom breaks and that they shouldn't be hearing the bathroom door more than anything else in the store.
	•	During my interview, the manager mentioned they plan to fire most of the current staff because “they don’t do anything.” They also described some bizarre shoplifting protocols that seem inappropriate and unsafe.
	•	Something else I can’t ignore: they’ve interviewed a lot of candidates from a particular racial background, but the only ones who seem to get hired are not from that group. That, along with other things I’ve seen and heard, leads me to suspect discriminatory bias is at play. However, on the surface they do not seem to treat customers or staff from other racial backgrounds with disrespect.

Is this retaliation? Harassment? Is it an attempt to make me quit so that the report my family member wrote becomes void? Just bad management? I want to protect myself but I’m unsure how to navigate it without drawing more fire.

antiwork,job offer negotiation,"RTO enacted after job started and offered remote + lying, vindictive manager = Time to move on.","UPDATE: Oh boy this is wild… ok so firstly I booked time with the Senior leader to present my resignation. I took printouts, a usb, a bunch of statements and a whole hell of a lot of evidence as to the fuckery that has been happening. They ghosted me twice… I finally cornered both of them and we started our meeting, but I was quickly interrupted with “we don’t have much time so this’ll need to be quick.”

Last. F***ing. Straw.

“I appreciate your time is important, but apparently I’m not so I am issuing my resignation.”

You could hear a pin drop, you could feel the panic in the room. Suddenly every impossible request was being offered to me. Everything I wanted before now plus some, agreed to. Nothing was outside of my ask radius.

One glaring issue for me though: all of these benefits? All of these exciting new things? Only I would get. No one in my team. They’d all cop worse circumstances than before. So I push back…

Now begins the guilt trips… “Well we’ll have to issue full RTO. Sam will have to work for Bob directly. I e may have to dissolve the team entirely.

This is truly fucked. You can’t coerce me so you threaten my team? So I told the team. Senior management goes full tantrum. “That was said in confidence, that wasn’t to be relayed! Blah blah!”. They understand that they have proper fucked up because they showed me the face beneath the mask and I called them out on it. 

So I continue to state my resignation is final and they WONT ACCEPT IT. Every reason under the sun to think it out, give them a chance., make it work. At this point I’m angry. This isn’t them giving me what I want or what I need.

This is them trying desperately not to lose an asset. So I’m currently refusing meetings, refusing calls and pushing the conversation to email. Never in my wildest nightmares would I imagine this event sequence chasing me down -_-

————————————————————————

I started a new job about a year ago and it was a bit of a risk to me. Previous job was guaranteed remote (it was in the contract) and all the C Suite supported it because my manager gave them data to show the money savings. A new place poached me with the verbal offer of same deal but a LOT more money so I decided to take a chance.

Within a month they changed the deal to hybrid 2 days remote because they wanted my team to “build relationships and be visible”. What actually happened was a manager in a different team threw a tantrum of “why can they but we can’t!?”. For context, I’m in data - they’re in a role that can’t be done remote but they’ve been there longer and my department works alongside theirs. We got told by the upper management they can’t keep up the remote deal and that it’s non-negotiable. Strike 1.

So we worked our butts off building a positive relationship, working stuff out bland doing awesome stuff but being limited by our in office setups (screens kept getting taken, no dedicated space etc). We managed to work out a deal that we could return to remote if we can get everything up to spec and we smashed it.

On the last day of the benchmarking period, the stakeholder that said we were doing well started convincing us to submit stuff to them so they could provide feedback - what he was actually doing was feeding it to his manager and saying that our work quality is still shit (that tends to look that way when you’re being given prototype reports that are unfinished). Strike 2.

So we had a meeting with them and our CDO and were asked to explain. We tried, but in the end all of his statements were verbal and we had no evidence. Everything he did was done verbally, in person while at the office. He bagged me out (couldn’t care less) but when he started attacking the CDO for allowing this and my team for delivering undesirable work, I realised that this wasn’t going to change and overtime I realised it’s gotten worse. Every-time he gave positive feedback and asked for a copy, it was to present it as a fail and because he’s been there for years they leaned towards “we need to make him and his department happy, they’re key.” Strike 3.

So I switched my LinkedIn back on. Within a day I was hammered by recruiters. In a week I had interviews that had extremely competitive offers with the guarantee of remote being contractual. Received an offer today that was a unicorn of an offer from a group that interviewed me and they were lovely and an amazing step in the right direction. I’ve accepted (pending paperwork) so I’ll be the second lead this company has lost in as many years due to this same person.

Now the fun part: how do I tell them? Do I straight resign, telling them nothing? Do I throw the problem person under a bus and have my much wanted mic drop moment or do I test the water and see if they make a counter offer (they can’t match this, not a chance, not with that managers opinion on WFH). I don’t even know if I want them to know I have something else sorted. Regardless of counter offer, this place has ruined my mental health and I’ve learned that if I can’t change things, may as well take another hop.

The best part is: the things I’ve built were VERY bespoke, require high levels of coding competencies and I haven’t had a change to create documentation, nor train others so there’s major assets that will degrade and fail after time without model refinement and adjustments.",345,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1f4qv50/rto_enacted_after_job_started_and_offered_remote/,1725009561.0,Kindly-Strike4228,1f4qv50,advice_seeking
antiwork,job offer negotiation,HR rescinded the job offer after assuring me that I have been selected,"I’ve been looking for a job for about 3 months now.

Ever since that I’ve been looking for a job (as a Content Writer) and after countless applications, I finally landed one (or it seemed like it). 

After 4-5 rounds of interviews I finally got shortlisted at a company. After salary negotiations, the HR kept reassuring me that I’ll be receiving my offer letter shortly. The HR kept giving the reason that the offer letter is ready and just the CEO’ s approval and signature is pending, and that I’ll be onboarded this week itself. After asking for continuous updates for more than 3 days, the HR now informs that they are actually looking for a Content Marketer and my job offer has been kept on hold indefinitely. I was really upset and the HR kept saying that it’s the upper- management’s decision and that there is nothing she can do about it.

antiwork,job offer negotiation,I rejected 3 job offers that would have paid me WAY more using a high school metric.,"This will be a relatively simple post but it will be important to determine how you build your equations and plug values for your total compensation and deductions. 

I have been on the job market since November of 2023. Granted, my current employer is actually very kind to me and the balance is nice but as all American citizens do living and earning away from the gold standard, inflation is killing us and it's never enough money. 

I have been browsing around, looking for better room to grow and find a job with better compensation. 

Ultimately, I have now rejected 3 jobs that would have DRAMATICALLY paid more than my current salary (25% and above and even double my income) using a metric from high school to determine the true value of the job offer. 

Now, this has not come without some flack against me. I have had close family, mentors, and friends criticize me for my methodology of valuing a job opportunity but for now, the philosophy is psychologically sound and until I have partial stake in a business and I'm not just an employee, I will always evaluate a job opportunity with this method. 

What did you do in high school? If you worked part time whether out of need or just a want, you looked for the highest paying job per hour. The more hours you worked, the more you got paid and the bigger the paycheck got as your pay rate went up. 

I went from 9 bucks an hour to 10 to 14. That was how I went about it in high school through college. 

Suddenly, you make it to the workplace full time and you are paid a salary. You're suddenly told to FORGET this valuation of a job's opportunity. Your salary is your salary. You work till the job is done. You're also told to keep going for higher SALARY regardless of hours or work responsibilities. 

Well....not in my life. 

My current job is great. I have a 40 hour work week and never do overtime. My 401K match is 6% and my insurance is about 95% covered by my employer. Also, 14 days of PTO isn't great but is better than others. 

Ultimately, i developed an equation. (Get your excel sheet out now). I work 40 hours a week times 52. That's my total hours worked per year. My salary divided against total year hours is my pay per hour but it's gross pay, not after tax and benefits. 

I ask Google for my net pay in my state based on gross salary to have a net pay per year. Google AI is pretty reliable at this. 

I have my insurance policies which costs X amount per month multiplied by 12. These are total work deductions for the year. 

Then I add in my 401K match to my sheet at 6%. So now, I add my total proceeds from my 401k (gross salary X percentage) 

Now, PTO is tricky but I do total days as a figure of gross pay. So take your gross salary divided by 365. Then you multiply by your total pto days. It's a rough figure but good enough to show your PTO compensation. 

With this information, i add my total compensation of net pay, 401k match, pto, and then subtract my total deductions. I then use this figure to divide by my total work hours for the year. I have a fairly precise, after tax measurement of my hourly rate. This is a fairly good metric for how much your employer values you. 

Be sure you have a lot of plugs when you build this. Hard coding leaves room for errors. You can add a bonus into this but with a company able to withdraw a bonus at will, it should not be considered a guarantee. You could also add commute time to your working hours if you like. No harm in that but if you rent, it can otherwise be easy to move closer to your new workplace. My vote, don't add commute unless you own a home or really enjoy the place you rent. 

Now, take the job offer you have on the table and build those same values into the plugs. Net pay based on salary, insurance cost, 401K match, hours worked, pto, etc. 

Now, not all companies are honest but lying about compensation is punishable by law. For the majority of companies, they will be honest about the hours needed to work a job because they don't want someone to quit due to the commitment (and you can reasonably assume how many hours the job would take).

I have declined 3 job offers in the past year alone, even though they were going to ""pay"" way more but after the hours of work were put in and the paycheck was collected, I was of equal value or LESS value to them than my current employer using this equation. 

Job 1: This was going to be a job out of state that was going to pay about 10K more than my current job with almost equal benefits but there was one key. Their hour policy was 7am to 4:30pm in the office. No exceptions except Fridays. After I did the math, the extra 10K was completely negated by the extra hour and a half per day of time i had to be at work. Pointless lateral move in pay per hour for no reason. Declined. 

Job 2: This was an employer pretty much in my backyard from my residence that was going to be a great promotion of title. Approximately 25K more than my current job with about a 45 hour work week. Sounded sweet until the benefits....20% coverage of insurance which would have driven my health insurance alone to over 480 per month and only a 3% 401k match and 9 days of PTO. Effectively, a 3 dollar per hour CUT in pay from my current job.....fuck that. 

Job 3: I ultimately posted about this job in this subreddit the other week and I declined it. After all the math was done, it was almost double my salary but 70 hours per week instead of 40 and a 50% Healthcare coverage and a 3% 401k match. Only a 1.25 dollar per hour increase over my current job. For 70 hours a week?? Absolutely not. Negotiations failed and I turned them down. 

Bottom line, don't get fucked into being a worker bee for the false allure of better income. Go to the company that ACTUALLY values you more. 

They're a capitalist. You are too with your money and income. Go for being the most valued. You're a limited commodity. Unlike a corporation that can live forever, you don't. Your time is valuable.

antiwork,job offer negotiation,Need your advice for this new job offer I got ,"**Please delete if it's not allowed.** 

  
Hey everyone, I don't know if I'm allowed to ask this question here but I would like to get as much insights as possible. 

Currently I'm negotiating a new job offer with an employer in the banking industry, I managed to successfully negotiate the pay I wanted, however the issue that stops me from jumping on this opportunity, is that they want me to go through a transitional contract with an ""agency"" with no visibility on how long it'll be before joining the actual banking company. **Basically my paperwork would be with this agency, but I'll be working at the bank for some time before signing a bank contract. They are doing this because the bank cannot hire at the moment, and the manager has urgent need for a new team member.** 

The agency's owner is friends with the bank manager, so there might be some conflicts of interests here. 

If I go with the transition contract, I have no idea **WHEN** i'll move to the actual company, and I'll be losing some good perks that I already have with my current employer. I don't like it when things aren't clear from the get go, and to me it seems like I'll be trapped in a transition contract for a long time with no perks.

antiwork,job offer negotiation,"Got berated for not showing up to work, even though I haven received or signed an offer","Just a story I wanna get out of my head. Maybe not appropriate for this sub. It's been almost 10 years since this happened but it still bugs me.

So about 10 years ago, in my early 20s, I was working in a shitty company that promised me a great sounding career path, but didn't follow through. I didn't want to waste any time so after about 1 year, I decided to start job hunting, before handing in my 2 weeks notice. 

I directly applied to a rival company, Company A, in the exact same industry. I heard good things about them, so why not? I also got contacted by a recruiter about Company B. This one was a big company in a completely different industry. I had nothing to lose, so I decided to try. 

Fast forward a month or so, Company A has decided to hire me. The strange thing though, was that we still hadn't discussed my salary. They told me that they'll send me an official offer in about 2 weeks, and 2 weeks after that, I'll start working. Not much time for negotiation...weird... but I was young, and really needed work so I told them sure, I'll wait. 

2 weeks later, no offer. I called them, and they just told me, ""Sorry, please wait 1 more week"".   
1 week later, still no offer. I called them again. And I told them firmly that if there's no offer, I'm not turning up. They apologized and said they'll get in touch. 

While this was happening, I was going through interviews with company B. They had hiring managers and team leads come in from overseas, so the process took a while. And after 5 rounds of interviews, they said they would like to hire me, discussed salaries, and I had a great offer on the table. This was on Wednesday. And the start date for Company A was the Monday of the following week. 

So I signed and sent the offer for Company B, and due to timezone delays, and going through a recruiter, they confirmed everything on Friday morning. So, I called Company A. A different hiring manager picked up the phone. I told her that because Company A hasn't sent me an offer, I have accepted an offer from another company, and that I will not be showing up on Monday. She said, ""Oh okay. That's too bad"". And hung up the phone. Oh... that was easy.

But this is where it gets interesting. At about 5PM I get a call from the hiring manager that was in charge of hiring me. And oh my god... the amount of abuse I got on the phone!! It was horrendous!   
""You fucking asshole! You fucked me right up haven't you? I had 5 clients lined up for you and now I have to go apologize to them. How could you do that? You are a terrible person! A horrible human!""  
It caught me by surprise so I said, ""I'm sorry, but you haven't given me an offer, I didn't know how much I was getting paid, I haven't accepted anything from you guys so how am I supposed to trust you?""  
And then he goes on to just berate me over and over, I just stayed silent until he calmed down.   
I asked, ""So, if I turned up, how much am I getting paid?""  
And oh my god, the offer was so low, it was insulting. I just scoffed and hung up the phone. I had about 5 missed calls after that so I blocked them and never turned back.

antiwork,job offer negotiation,"I rejected a lowball deal from a business who wanted to hire me as an intern, despite being 5 years out of college.","I was supposed to come in this Monday into a small business firm, from a company I interviewed all the way back in October. We had a stellar interview, but they rejected me, because they found someone else with a little bit more experience. 

They called me back this year, and told me that they had a recent uptick in projects, and could use additional help. I was really excited to say yes, until they told me that I would be an intern, with an entry-level salary I had when I was back in college, and that it would be non-negotiable until my 90 days were up 🫠

When I interviewed them back in October, I suspected I would receive a paycut. I was okay with a few dollars, but it was $10 cut offer. So it was really disheartening. 

I had a couple of other interviews that week, and then I finally got another job offer, where they matched the salary to my previous role. But I did not let the first company know. 

I have worked in the architecture industry since 2017, and I have learned throughout the years that many firm owners work in bad-faith. I thought maybe the first company was different back in October, especially when we talked about how the owner used to work at my last company many years ago and was miserable. 

So, I decided to waste their time for 2 weeks, before deciding to not show up. 

In my head I was contemplating whether I tell them over the phone I want more money for this ""internship"" or do it in person. I also thought about accepting the lowball, but also quiet quit or refuse to do any overtime while I worked there. If they want to demote me as an intern, 5 years out of college, then those 5 years of experience should get erased from my mind and my performance. But when I got this other offer, those concerns were thrown out the window. 

When I didn't show up, the manager did call me, asking where I was. I wish I said more to him, but what I said was along the lines of ""hey, I'm sorry, but I am 5 years out of college, and I think I'm too qualified to be an intern, so I will be rescinding my application; thank you for your time and I wish you the best of luck"". A part of me wanted to negotiate to the price I wanted, but another part of me wanted to chew him out for what I suspected this was all meant to exploit my experience. 

But anxiety choked me up, and I just respectfully rescinded. 

The next day, the company posted a new listing on Indeed, and it had the same wage that they tried to offer me.

In the end, I knew arguing or protesting was risky, because I don't have the lxuury of saying no in my current situation. But I'm glad that I did, because even in desperate times, not even this is worth it.

antiwork,how to get promoted,"My job encouraged me to join the education incentive program to finish my degree so I could get promoted, when I finished my bachelor's and asked about getting a promotion, HR accused me of lying about having a degree during the interview and suspended me. WTF?? ","Well, that basically sums it up. The Case Management job I applied to last year offered the lowest salary, and only required a high school diploma. After a 3 round interview process with HR, a panel of 16 housing managers, and my supervisors, I was offered the job. 

After working in the company for about a year, my supervisors encouraged me to go back to school so I could complete my degree in psychology and get promoted to the senior case management position. My supervisor asked HR if I would qualify for the education incentive program since I wanted to go back to school to finish my degree, and HR said yes. When I graduated with my bachelor's in psychology and completed my degree, I reached out to HR about getting a promotion and a pay raise. 

After weeks of ghosting me, they responded by telling me no, and insisted that I lied to them about having a degree during my interview. Keep in mind I was offered THE LOWEST PAYING JOB BECAUSE DURING THE INTERVIEW I MADE IT CLEAR THAT I WAS STILL TRYING TO FINISH SCHOOL.

After 4 weeks of trying to reach them i finally managed to get them on the phone. When I asked how it would make sense for me to lie about having a degree to get my job, when I applied to the lowest paying position because I did not have my degree..they refused to answer. 

When I reminded HR that they gave me permission to enroll in the education incentive program because I did not finish my degree...they refused to answer. 


They asked me to provide evidence about what I was referring to. When I emailed all of the transcripts and applications they reviewed and signed to approve my course registration at the beginning of every semester, they refused to look at it and told me that I needed to ""let them finish their investigation "". 

They promised me they would read the documents I sent. It has been 4 weeks, they haven't read a thing I've sent, and they still suspended me. The supervisors that encouraged me to enroll in the program are angry and confused, and I am angry and confused. My union representative told me they've been suspending a lot of other people as well and there's nothing they can do about it.

I’m almost 3 years into my dev career and I don’t know how much longer I can do this. Every day I have to log in, it feels like something inside me is dying. I sit at my desk and just stare at the screen. The work isn’t hard, I have delivered projects before successfully and I know how to do my job, that’s the worst part.

antiwork,how to get promoted,"Being unemployed is offensive in polite society, I guess","I graduated last year with flying colors. I immediately started applying for jobs in my field. My parents told me they were proud of me for getting my masters in such a tough field and were supportive and told me to take as much as I need. They bragged to all their friends how I graduated from one of the most prestigious universities in my country. They threw a big party just to parade me around. 

In 4 months, their attitude made a 180 degree turn. It didn't matter that I applied to 100+ job postings a week. It didn't matter I was still revising and learning extra skills. I was unemployed, and that was the biggest offense I could've done.

They stopped taking me to family events. They outright started to ignore me. 

It's not about the money. They're not struggling by any means. My father is an executive and mother is employed only to have something to do.

I've finally gotten a job through an acquaintance, completely unrelated to my degree and making less than min wage. Lo and behold, I was suddenly back to being a golden child.

I don't know if I'm the only one with that kind of experience, but it sure as hell made me think. Why is that all I ever did is nothing if I don't work? I'm fucking miserable now, and it's becoming clear that I have no chance of actually being hired in my field. This shitty office job is literally making me suicidal and it doesn't help that my parents, the only source of housing I can afford, are once again starting to turn since I've been employed there for half a year and with no signs of getting promoted and ""getting my own house"".

antiwork,how to get promoted,Does anyone else have a spouse who has that weird corporate mindset?,"My husband was recently promoted to store manager at the retail company he’s worked at for 10ish years. 

A couple weeks ago, he told me about an employee he promoted to a lead “key-carrier” position, and how he thought this person showed a lot of promise, and he was familiar/friendly with this guy because they worked at a previous location together some years back. The next I heard about this employee was that he’d had some rough life events and was calling out to work. I know for sure that this employee got into a car accident and needed some minor medical care, but I believe there was also a family tragedy within the same week. My spouse recounted to me these stories and said- paraphrasing, “I’m frustrated because he’s making me look bad but I can’t really be mad at him because he had real reasons not to show up to work.” It rubbed me the wrong way because this employee had fallen on hard times, and my spouse was worried about his reputation as a manager? Just yesterday, he told me that this same employee showed up to work smelling of alcohol, and a customer complained. Super unprofessional, no doubt. But my husband said, “I can’t believe he would do this to me. What a betrayal, after how I’d stuck my neck out for him.” Um, he’s not doing it to you…? This came at a huge shock to me, but I just changed the subject. 

There’s been some other stuff too that I hate hearing about. He’s mentioned having a meeting about legal union-busting, he mentioned flat-out denying his employees time off to go home for the holiday (it’s a college town so lots of uni kids work there), he complains that he won’t bonus because the employees don’t get enough good surveys or credit card signups….

antiwork,how to get promoted,Update — (Subtly) complained to manager about my raise and this is what they said,"I [wrote this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/s/CIzjiP99gq) the other day after I learned I’m getting a $2,000 raise this year. Long story short our team was cut so the company could save money, and yet our goals to get our bonuses are higher than when we had more people on staff. 

$2,000 equates to less than a dollar extra an hour. My rent is going up $800 this next year, so after taxes, I’m not even going to feel that raise at all.

“bE gRatEfuL yOu GoT a RaIsE” yeah that’s basically what my manager said. This is a slap in the face. After we had the most difficult year since I started here over 6 years ago.

The company essentially gave us two quarterly goals: X% growth from this quarter last year is half a bonus. Y% growth is a full bonus. We’re JUST under the bigger growth number and the quarter ends tomorrow. There were external factors that messed with our growth for about two weeks last month, or we would have cleared that number by now.

The company doesn’t care how hard we work. If external factors fuck our numbers then we didn’t hit what they wanted us to.

So my manager mentioned the goal to me today and I responded, “it would be nice getting the full bonus after seeing what my raise was.”

Their response? “I’m surprised raises weren’t frozen this year so every little bit helps.”

They were in the same position as me a year and a half ago but got promoted. It’s so funny how as people work their way up in companies, they suddenly start defending all the corporate bullshit and invalidating how their team feels. Especially if their team feels negative.

Previously, I was part of a small sort/d bag team, but I have recently moved back to the unload area because my local warehouse is downsizing its small sort staff due to the introduction of automation and robots. They're currently dismantling that part of the building. I've been told that unload is now the only position available, as many individuals and supervisors from small sort are transitioning to the loading area. For months, there have been talks about shutting down small sort. I've often heard that jobs in the warehouse are becoming outdated, with many UPS warehouse workers facing layoffs, firings, and terminations as robots take over these roles. My managers have suggested that it won’t be long before the entire warehouse shifts to automation, leading to layoffs in all departments, including unloading. When I took this warehouse job, I made the choice to join the union, but I now regret that decision due to the low pay and high union dues that are deducted from my paycheck each month.

antiwork,toxic workplace,"Noticing the same toxic group dynamics at different workplaces – silent bullying, pack mentality, and self-appointed leaders","Someone shared their experience of encountering the same unsettling patterns at several different workplaces — usually through staffing agencies. At first, everything seems fine. But over time, a familiar dynamic appears: there’s always an informal “leader,” someone who sets the tone, scolds others for not working fast enough, and influences the group’s behavior.

At one previous job, this person was bullied daily by two coworkers. When they reported it to a manager, nothing was done — the bullies were seen as “nice guys” by leadership. Another colleague had even filed a complaint after one of the bullies made a vulgar, inappropriate comment to her, but that too was swept under the rug.

Now, at a new workplace, the same dynamics are starting to show. There’s a tightly knit group, a new guy who’s trying to prove he’s the best, and someone positioning themselves as the “pack leader,” calling out others for minor things. To make matters more unsettling, someone from the previous toxic workplace is now working here too. It’s starting to feel like a loop — and the person can’t help but wonder if they’re being intentionally sent to workplaces that already have a problematic atmosphere.

This isn’t about a single bad experience. It’s about a recurring sense of being excluded, working in environments where silent bullying is tolerated, and social power plays matter more than the actual job.

antiwork,toxic workplace,I reported my boss for poisoning people and was told that I needed to “read more”. ,"I reported a serious safety concern to my general manager regarding the unsafe mixing of pool chemicals (including oxidizers, chlorine shock, and muriatic acid). This practice poses a significant risk of toxic chemical exposure, including the potential release of chlorine gas, which can be fatal. The general manager escalated the issue to HR, who promptly investigated. I was interviewed by a corporate representative and an HR representative, during which I provided a detailed explanation of the dangers involved. I was assured the matter would be resolved and emphasized that my identity should remain confidential to avoid workplace repercussions or bias.

Shortly after, I was called into a meeting with the director of operations and a high-ranking corporate official, where I was reprimanded for allegedly bypassing proper reporting channels. For clarity, I had followed the appropriate chain of command by reporting the issue to my general manager, who then escalated it further. During this meeting, I reiterated the dangers of mixing these chemicals, noting that even basic research or consultation with industry representatives confirms the risks. I was told the issue would be addressed.

Despite these assurances, I was called into a meeting with my GM and the reported individual and was informed that the individual I reported was made aware of my identity, in direct contradiction to my request for anonymity. My supervisor began the single largest gaslighting event I have yet to witness and began defending their unsafe practices by providing inaccurate explanations, and dismissed the established risks of mixing chemicals. He straight up told me I need to read more and said it was safe to swim 10 minutes after he puts the strongest shock we can buy from our supplier in the pool. They also claimed that the chlorine produced by the facility’s saltwater generator differs from liquid chlorine, suggesting it was safe to add acid even at high chlorine levels—a claim that contradicts basic chemical safety principles.

I am deeply concerned about the lack of appropriate action and the risks this situation poses, particularly as the pool is in a hotel setting frequented by families and children. Retaliation remains a significant concern, and I fear that escalating this issue to external authorities may jeopardize my employment. However, I believe that if this continues unaddressed, the consequences could be catastrophic. I don’t know what to do or who to turn to as I have just been made out into a “tattletale” as far as corporate is concerned. 
 
Edit: I prefer to not disclose what state I’m in as I fear it would narrow down my identity to my supervisor should he come across this, but as afar as record keeping goes, he was dumb enough to right on purpose paper audit book that he mixed these chemicals himself and I have audio recorded all in person meetings since the original report to my gm.

antiwork,systemic burnout,From Europe: how the hell do you live like this - and why does the world still admire it?,"Not here to mock anyone - I’m from Western Europe, and honestly, once you take a real look, the American work/life system just feels like straight-up dystopia.
No paid vacation guaranteed. No real sick leave. Health care tied to employment. “At-will” firing. Union-busting is standardized. Insane rent. Debt for basic education. Credit scores as a leash...

And the worst part even your so-called ""progressive"" politicians never seriously push for what we consider basic rights - universal healthcare, tenant protections, a decent minimum wage, or like actual work-life balance.

Meanwhile, your media exports this myth of American greatness - the land of freedom, hustle culture, the self-made dream. And the wild part is that a lot of people around the world still buy into it. They envy the lifestyle, without realizing it's built on burnout, fear, and financial precarity.

So here’s my honest question, how do you keep going ? Why aren’t more people criticising this system ? Is it propaganda ? Lack of alternatives ? Fear of losing even the little you have ?

This isn’t judgment - it’s disbelief. From here, it straight up looks like the system is chewing you up and somehow convincing the rest of the world to call it freedom. And now that same shit is slowly creeping in over here too.

I'm really curious to hear your perspectives.",17933,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1k3otku/from_europe_how_the_hell_do_you_live_like_this/,1745162222.0,EphemeralMoron,1k3otku,advice_seeking
antiwork,systemic burnout,[UPDATE] From a European: U.S. work culture is dystopian — here’s what I would do if I lived there,"

Thanks for all the responses on my last post — solidarity to everyone who’s stuck in that grind and still finding the energy to push back. Since a few people asked, here’s what I would focus on if I lived in the U.S. and wanted to change this mess:

1. UNIONIZE. UNIONIZE. UNIONIZE.

I can’t stress this enough. In Europe, most of the rights we take for granted — paid vacation, parental leave, job security — came through decades of union pressure. The U.S. labor movement has been gutted, demonized, and sabotaged by corporations and politicians alike, but it can be rebuilt. Start small. Talk to coworkers. Normalize labor solidarity again.

2. DESTIGMATIZE REST.

One of the most toxic exports from the U.S. is the glorification of overwork. “Sleep when you’re dead” is not a personality — it’s a warning sign. Advocate for mental health, for boundaries, for actually using your vacation time (if you even get any). And stop treating burnout as a badge of honor.

3. COLLECTIVELY REJECT BULLSH*T JOB EXPECTATIONS.

Your boss messaging you on a Sunday? Don’t reply. Don’t set the precedent. Normalize saying “no” to unpaid overtime, to extra responsibilities without extra pay, to “hustle culture.” One person doing this gets punished. Ten people doing it changes company policy.

4. PUSH LOCAL AND STATE POLITICS HARD.

The federal system is slow and corrupted, yes, but a lot of labor reform can start local. Push for citywide minimum wage increases. Paid sick leave ordinances. Tenant protections. Local change matters — and builds pressure upwards.

5. DON’T BE AFRAID TO QUIT BAD JOBS (IF YOU CAN).

I get that it’s not always possible — the system is designed to trap people. But if you have a way out of a toxic workplace, take it. You are not obligated to suffer just because someone gave you a paycheck. Your dignity isn’t negotiable.

6. STOP WORSHIPPING THE RICH.

The idea that billionaires “earned” their way up is the biggest scam in U.S. mythology. In Europe, we look at someone hoarding $100 billion and think, “How many people had to be underpaid or exploited for that to happen?” Question wealth. Demand taxes. Support redistribution.



Look, I know the odds are stacked against American workers. But you’re not powerless. They want you isolated, exhausted, and scared. Organizing anywhere — workplace, online, in your neighborhood — is a radical act of resistance.

antiwork,systemic burnout,"FMLA is supposed to protect your job. In Utah, it’s more like a countdown to termination.","I followed every step. Filled out the paperwork. Got it approved. Took a short leave to deal with real mental health issues that were affecting my ability to function. PTSD and BPD. Not just burnout or stress. I came back thinking things would go back to normal. Instead, everything shifted.

Suddenly I was under a microscope. Stuff that had never been a problem before became a problem. I was put on a performance improvement plan out of nowhere. Then fired for “underperforming” and “missing deadlines” which sounds serious until you hear what actually happened.

I was told I ordered too much dinner for a client dinner and missed a graphic for a showroom setup. That’s it. No write-ups before that. No formal conversations. Just suddenly I’m not meeting expectations and I’m gone.

What? Since when is that a fireable offense?

But that wasn’t the point. The point was they were done with me the moment I became inconvenient.

That’s what retaliation looks like. Quiet. Subtle. Just enough to make it seem like your fault. And here in Utah, the system doesn’t care. Employers know how to cover themselves just enough. They smile in HR meetings and talk about support and flexibility but behind the scenes it’s all about protecting the company.

I filed a formal complaint. It’s still being investigated. I’ve shared the emails. The timeline. The inconsistencies in their story. The way they rewrote the narrative after the fact. And apparently making it this far in the process is rare. Which tells me something is off. Not just with my case, but with how many people never even get this far.

FMLA was supposed to give people a chance to take care of themselves without losing their job. But when you live in a state that favors employers no matter what, it’s just a trap. They wait, build a case, and cut you loose once it’s safe to do it.

I’m not saying every company is like this. But too many are. Especially when it comes to mental health. We’re either too unstable or not sick enough. There’s no in between. No grace. Just judgment.

If this sounds familiar, you’re not alone. And if you think this doesn’t happen here, you’re not paying attention.

antiwork,systemic burnout,Productivity tripled since 1950. Why are we still working 40-hour weeks?,"It's been almost 100 years since wide adoption of 40 hour work week. It was adopted after the period of great depression, sometimes also referred as crisis of overproduction . The fact that immense human suffering was caused by overproduction is mind-boggling. Fast forward 100 years, and now we ""enjoy"" massive increase in the productivity, by various estimates people are between 3 to 5 times more productive. Doesn't matter, we are still working 40-hour workweek like we did 100 years ago. There is this a famous prediction (been repeated on this forum to death) by John Maynard Keynes about 15 hour work week by 2030. Why was he wrong? He massively underestimated capitalism's addiction to waste and haven't accounted for human irrationality.

Productivity gains are obvious: split between agriculture/industrial and service sector went from 30%/35%/35% to 1.5%/16%/83% (US data used for reference). And all of the productivity gains went into the service sector bloat. You know - bullshit jobs of all varieties, endless non-productive jobs involving zero-sum competition, idle jobs with a lot of dead time.

I see two main problems.

# Problem 1: capitalism is becoming obsolete

Everyone likes to blame capitalism. Yes, ""greed of 1%"" is a factor and we should increase taxes for the rich. And while those propositions are valid, they don't fully address the issue. This system used to work for older generations. Between 1950s and early 2000s, Boomers and Gen Xers were able to get stable jobs that could sustain them, afford starting new families, buying a house all the while having a comfortable standard of living. This social contract is now broken and productivity gains vanish into corporate profits and rentier capitalism.

We already live in abundance economy: there is no scarcity of food (large excess of food that created gets thrown away), there is no scarcity of material goods (luxury brands destroy part of their stock in order to artificially increase value, planned obsolescence and limited repairability of Apple products) and abundance of entertainment. Scarcity for real estate is artificially created while scarcity for luxury cars and healthcare from top medical doctors is impossible to solve.

# Problem 2: higher education scam and elite overproduction

Now imagine following situation, very typical one. Parent tells his child: ""Sarah/Johnny, I'm a dumb guy and worked very hard at my trade. If you want to succeed in life, you should get a higher education"". Now repeat this situation a few billion times across the globe over multiple decades and you will get modern economy. After getting their pointless degrees they will follow a path of becoming a middle-manager or a bureaucrat in some bloated government agency, maybe go into finance or consulting. Or they get no job at all - 40% of recent university graduates are unemployed. Right now an average age of a plumber or electrician is 50 years old. This split can even be seen internationally, where white-collar ""brain"" jobs are concentrated in western hemisphere, while Chinese and Indians are working in sweatshops (this is an exaggeration, of course, since manufacturing and office work are present in both).

There is quite a bit of fake activity within modern economies, wasted human labor. Significant portion of white-collar jobs produce close to no value, office jobs in countries like South Korea and Japan have insane work culture with relatively low value output (recent push for 70 hour work week in SK, no wonder they have the lowest birth rate in the world). Over-education and elite overproduction has to be at the heart of the issue. This is a modern plight; it causes individuals a lot of psychological suffering and, most likely, a major source of burnout (Graeber coined term ""psychological violence"").

And it doesn't exclude STEM degrees. Pretty much the only addition to an average household in the past 25 years came in the form of a smartphone, everything else was a form of gradual incrementalism. Introduction of a smart IoT self-cleaning cat litter is an indication of a total technological stagnation, not progress (the only exception being rapid improvements within IT sector and computers).

# Solution

People should abandon their useless degrees, learn a real trade or go back working for a factory. Then we can have 15 hour work week, work 2 days a week and have 5 weekends. Slash most of the non-essential service sector jobs by 80% and we can change dystopia into utopia.

# Other remarks:

\> UBI as a potential solution. It might work, but it could also fail. What might end up happening is that half of the people would sit at home and play the video games and the other half would have to do back-breaking labour, which would be fundamentally unfair. Outcome is unknown, it was never tried on a large enough scale.

\> Soviet Union with their 0 unemployment policy was notorious for bureaucratic bloat, so this is not an issue exclusive to capitalism.

\> Solution cannot work for all types of jobs. Some occupations would still require working for extended periods of time in order to earn and maintain high levels of professionalism (e.g. science, medicine).

\> Elites might see the issues with capitalism but are both profiting from and are too afraid to challenge status quo. Many politicians are too focused on short term election cycles to propose something radical.

\> Graeber definition of bullshit jobs was about subjective perception, when criteria for BS should be objective. Few years ago there was a trend of hiring data scientists to improve business performance. Someone like that might think that their job is valuable since they are looking for trends and patterns in data in order to improve sales, but in reality it's just another form of zero-sum competition. ""We should hire more people for marketing division since our competitors are doing the same.""

\> Some economists argue that working hours stayed the same because of consumerism. This argument makes little sense: industrial production decreased from 35% to 16% which includes both productivity increase for old goods and production of new goods (computers, smartphones).",297,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1kxih8j/productivity_tripled_since_1950_why_are_we_still/,1748442399.0,wellmet31415926,1kxih8j,advice_seeking
antiwork,systemic burnout,i cannot work for the next 50 years.,"i have autism and had to drop out of college (the equivalent of high school in the uk) because the stress was so unmanageable and i could not handle the pressure. if i knew that working full time would be 10000x worse, i would’ve stuck with it however badly it would’ve affected me. i am currently working at a restaurant as a waitress and it is draining me for all i have and i am starting to realise this world is not built for me and others like me.

after leaving school i was unemployed for a year, even though i have experience working and have good GCSE grades. in the uk we have what’s called “disability confident” employers that guarantee an interview to any disabled candidates, including autism. in that year i didn’t get one interview. it wasn’t like i was applying to be an astronaut, just casual shelf stocking at supermarkets and the like with no experience needed just to get by. 

it was only after i started saying i didn’t have any disability or mental health issues that i started to even get interviews. i didn’t make any changes to my CV or anything, i just didn’t tick that box and suddenly i had 3 interviews. my current work has no idea about my struggles and it will negatively affect my position if i disclose it now. 

i am in the middle of possibly my worst autistic burnout of my life, i can only just about take care of myself and i feel like such a burden on my family. i’m working 50 hours a week without a proper break and it is killing me. 

management is shocking, the customers are so rude and ive experienced sexual harassment from customers and staff. even though im good at my job, the social aspect is just absolutely wrecking me. i struggle with noises and textures and every day im on the verge of a meltdown. i had one last week when i was the only waitress and had a full restaurant to manage by myself, including a table of 20 people, even though ive only been there 2 months but i just tried to play it off as having a panic attack. i have been sexually harassed in every place that i have worked at and am used to it now, i can just ignore it but it’s just adding up now and taking a toll.

i’m 20 and i cannot even begin to fathom how im going to make it through the next week, let alone the next 50 years in work. i’m “too high functioning” to not work and id feel bad just sitting back taking benefits. the current system is only meant for the rich, but it especially does not allow for people like me to live comfortably at all. 

i cannot see a way where i can even live a life for myself and the only reason i am staying alive is because of my little sibling, who is also neurodivergent and i worry about every day for when they leave school and have to get a job. i don’t know if it will get better for me. im in a very negative headspace and i know that rationally it can get better but the burnout is trying to convince me otherwise.",182,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1k9w9y3/i_cannot_work_for_the_next_50_years/,1745848883.0,error-----,1k9w9y3,advice_seeking
antiwork,boss is a bully,It’s been a little over a year since the “prank” at work that changed everything.,"At my job about a year ago, someone in my department hung a teddy bear on a noose outside my office. It was played off as like “a joke” but I am the only black employee in the department. They waited till I came in and had people around waiting to watch me find the thing. And then they (singular person just trying to keep it anonymous) joked about how they spent time on YouTube learning how to “tie a noose”. 

I reported it, though it took me a lot to do so, especially because this person is also dating someone else in the department and was a beloved person for a lot of the staff. In hindsight I made some errors because I stated I didn’t want them to be fired, and this was mostly from fear of being retaliated against in my small department full of people that love them. (Spoiler alert they weren’t fired and it was bad anyways). I would absolutely make more of a ruckus if I could go back and change it. It was very swept under the rug. 

Tbh it brought me back to bad place that I was healing from since I’ve been bullied most of my schooling years. I ended up in the mental hospital a few months after this. 

It’s been truly awful, I had to deal with hearing everyone talk shit about me for weeks. The environment is hostile and racist. And the workload has been insane. I’m doing the job of at least 4 people. And my boss has revealed recently that I make 10-20k less than I’m supposed to but he’s just shrugged his shoulders and said “can’t do anything about it since we’re in debt” 

I cry almost everyday on the way into work and now I just keep wondering why I’ve even stayed this long. I honestly feel like I’ve been living in a daze or like a brain fog for the last year and some change. I’m really sick at myself for not standing up or not even leaving. It’s taken this long for me to snap out of it. I feel like I’ve just woken up to my own life and now I’ve really gotta make some changes (I am actively making plans to leave) . But I just wanted to get what’s been happening off my chest. 

Edit: Thanks for the comments I feel validated in how awful I’ve been feeling and even more determined to get out of here as soon as possible. I see the comments about getting lawyer is that even a thing I could/should do since it’s been so long? 

Edit 2: I will be looking into the free consultations that you all have talked about thank you. I have to go back into work today and I feel simultaneously valid and really burned out. But like I said I’m applying to get out of here asap.

antiwork,boss is a bully,My boss is a bully ,"Hi all! I am hoping to get some advice or at least a reality check. 

I am currently employed by a small family owned construction company, where I work in the front office as a secretary. My job responsibilities are very straightforward and revolves around helping the office staff with their tasks. My salary is above average for my area, my schedule is 8-5, and I work M-F with paid holidays. 

Sounds great on paper. 

My direct report is the niece of the owner and cousin to the operator of the company. The owner is retired and takes a paycheck but does not participate in day to day operations. Her cousin is chill and laid back but unfortunately he doesn’t keep her in check. Most of the time, she only acts out when her cousin or his wife are not in.

Recently, however, she has gone full crazy with her cousin present. While he did have a “talk” with her afterwards, he did not intervene in the moment. I feel that it’s only a matter of time before she starts up again. 

I do feel like she is testing the waters with me, as she did not show any of these behaviors when I first started but now she is slowly increasing her belittlement of my coworker and I. 

I should also mention she is HR for the company. 

My boss is a bully. She is not a leader in any sense of the word. She only knows how to escalate situations and always needs to be right. She is not pleasant to be around. 

While she has not yelled at me (yet) I know it’s coming as she has talked down to me a few times in the past.

She acts as though her position is the most important and she can’t be disturbed but gets mad when my coworker and I don’t ask questions. She wants us to work independently, but finds fault in every decision we make. 

She’s 100% a hypocrite when it comes to workplace policies, as she sets directives for the office that she does not follow herself. 

My coworker and I are the only ones that get treated poorly by her. She treats all the family members with respect and all of the construction workers nicely as well. 

I am so terrified of setting boundaries with her. 

I am certain that when I find a new job, giving her any kind of notice will set her off and result in an even more toxic environment for the time I have left. 

As for my performance, I got a raving review at 90 days. Everyone has complimented my work ethic, including my boss and her cousin. Personality wise, I am very nice and non-confrontational, it’s a skill I don’t have. I am constantly told that I am very polite and professional by my colleagues. I think I am really just doing the bare minimum for professionalism because everyone is acclimated to my boss’s belittlement of others and her rude remarks. I honestly feel very bad for the people that speak with her on the phone. 

I’ve rambled enough and if you’ve gotten this far, thank you for reading. I honestly could go on and on about how horrible my boss is. 

What do I do? Every plan I can come up with involves me finding another job and then giving them notice via email on Friday after work that I will not be back on the following Monday. 

I know this is not professional but I am not sure how to talk to this woman. 

I should also add that I can stick this job out until I find something else, but I would definitely like to leave this dumpster fire of a company.  ",22,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1fnybzq/my_boss_is_a_bully/,1727133401.0,nanettehimmelfarb,1fnybzq,advice_seeking
antiwork,boss is a bully,"My boss is a bully, I wanna quit but have doubts","So I (28f) have been working at the same company for the last 3 years, and I'm asking for advice because I don't know what to do. My boss, let's call her S, has been very hostile to me lately and I'm kinda done with her tbh. I'm sorry this is a rant.

Both my husband and I work at the same office but in different areas within the same department. We were not married when we started working here, but we had dated for a few years. He was and intern to S when we were in uni (this is how we both landed our jobs) and she has liked him a lot since then. S is a lesbian so she doesn't like him like him, my husband is just a kind soul and people generally like him.

Things have not been great with S for a while now. S is a very reactive person with her anger and that has been a huge problem for her at work, almost got her fired once, so she already has a strike with HR. I'm her only subordinate, so I get a lot of shit from her. But she is very rude in general, even to her own boss (who is also a woman, let's call her L). L has said to me before that S has made her cry on occasion because of hurtful things she has said while they were discussing work related stuff. L has also mentioned to my husband that she is afraid I would quit because I could no longer stand S and her attitude. And I guess L's not wrong.

Now, I'm not a perfect worker, I make mistakes and I lack in some skills like everyone else does, which I'm trying to get better at. Being honest, I have some trouble communicating effectively, and I'm behind of some of my work. And I get that it can make a boss angry, but S's reactions are almost always blown way out of proportion. There has been times where S has reprimanded me in front of other coworkers, I find that she generally lies or exaggerates things to get a point across (and not just to me), and somehow she always finds a way to compare herself to me (because she used to do the work I do now). She always goes on about how hard it has been to get all the things we have now and how hard she has worked for all that, and how I don't appreciate any of it cause I've had an ""easy life"". L has also commented on how S gives herself all the credit and often leaves out the part that she had her support.

Other instances when I feel S has been out of line with her comments. She often commented on my relationship, has never said it verbally but I can tell she thinks I'm not good enough for my husband. She has made comments on how he does all the housework, how I control his money and him, how I have the last word on everything about the relationship, and that I don't take good care of him. None of this is true, she knows crap about our life. She also mentions whenever she has the chance, that she likes my husband more than she likes me because she met him first and that she would risk her neck for him before she does for me, nobody ever asks btw. I'm almost a year older than my husband so whenever she cans, she brings that up and says I took advantage of him, and that I'm a cougar, and that I look so much older than him. Both my husband and I look younger than our age and we get comments on that all the time. She never congratulated us on getting married, I think she didn't even congratulate us when we got engaged. She also comments frequently that my hair always looks disheveled because I don't usually put it in an updo, I do comb it every morning and when I need to, I put it in a ponytail. We don't have any policies regarding hair, except security wise. All of these comments, she makes in front of others, and she tries to make them sound like jokes, but I can tell it's mostly to annoy me and get a reaction out of me.

This past month has been the worst. S has been constantly angry and annoyed with me, her tone of voice has been less than cordial the few times she has talked to me, she doesn't look my way when we are with more coworkers, and her attitude is just so immature and passive-aggressive towards me. A few weeks ago, my husband was busy and wasn't able to take me home at the end of our shift. We have to come in and leave on a company car but S has made a fuss before if I got rides from other people from the office. A friend that I usually ask for a ride was out on vacation so I asked S if she could give me a ride or if I asked someone else. She responded something along the lines of, I don't feel like it since you never ask me for rides anymore, why don't you call (friend) and see if he comes and picks you up. This was not in a joking manner. She has also said in front of other coworkers, 'why are you planning so far ahead? we might fire you because you don't behave well', also not in a joking tone. S is a very controlling person, and she explodes when she loses control. She's also weirdly possessive, and I've had to ""ask for her permission"" to get rides from other people.

My problem right now is that I'm not sure if I should quit or not. The job is fine, it's in my field and I sort of like it and enjoy it sometimes. The monthly pay is not that great, but every year we get kind of like a production bonus which can go from 15-20 times our monthly salary, sometimes even more. Money wise we would be fine if I quit and my husband kept working. We have talked about this and he supports me in my decision, he has also mentioned he would like me to quit because he sees that I'm struggling right now and he would like me to be happy, he is not happy with the way S treats me regularly but he can't say anything because we have to maintain a professional relationship at the office and there is a conflict of interest because of our marriage. I'm leaning towards quitting, I would be a housewife mostly, and I would look for a remote job with fewer hours, so I don't depend entirely on him. We both have money saved, but we are looking into buying our first house and we don't want to take out such a huge loan.  I have thought of staying a bit longer so we can save up more for the downpayment, but it has been very hard and it's taking a big toll on me to stay. I constantly have an upset stomach, my upper back is a mess with stress, I think I'm even clenching my jaw subconsciously because sometimes it hurts so bad. I feel like I'm about to cry all the time, I get home and I don't feel like doing anything, I just wanna lay down, and I feel that the things that usually bring me joy, don't do so anymore. And I find it harder and harder to do what I have to do at work. 

I'm also afraid of quitting. I'm afraid that if I quit, it means that I'm a failure and that this job and S defeated me. I also don't wanna worry my family because they already worry so much because me and my husband are far away from home and have no family near us. I'm afraid my life is gonna spiral if I quit. That people are gonna talk shit about me around the office, specially S, and how that can affect my husband because he would still be here. I'm afraid that I'm gonna isolate my husband from the coworkers we do get along with because we would try to avoid S in any social gathering because of me.  I also feel that I would be failing myself because I would be leaving a lot of unfinished work here, but then wonder if I'm failing myself for staying here and standing this behavior towards me.

S has said to me before that if she ever crosses a line that I can call her out on it, but I don't trust that, I think it will backfire on me very quickly and that she's just gonna be worse to me. I'm at a disadvantage because of the power play. She doesn't control her temper, so I never know how she's gonna react to anything I say. Also, why should I be the one telling her when she's being rude? She's a grown ass woman (a few years older than me) who should know the difference between treating people right and treating them poorly. And she knows she has a problem, she's been in therapy for more than a year because of her temper, and she knows when she behaves like an ass, she has mentioned this during her lectures before, rarely offered an apology though. So I'm scared to bring this up with her and bear the consequences. I'm also afraid to bring this up with L, I think she would understand a bit, but I also think she's on S's side and would question why I never said anything to S. I could make a complaint to HR, but I don't think I would go thru, I don't have any substantial proof about S's behavior other than my word vs hers. And yes she does have a history with HR, but they still have to investigate a complaint and I don't know if the rest of the office will be much help. So this could also affect me in the aftermath. 

I'm sorry this was too long, I just started writing and all of this came out. I'm sure I left out a lot of times S has mistreated me over the last years but I don't remember them right now, I try not to hold on to these memories. Thank you for your time if you read it all.

Mind you, that day I worked was to fill in for 2 people that didn't want to come into work which was yesterday. My manager asked me to come in and help so I did considering this manager was always nice to me. The job was being a busser so it was in a restaurant setting. I always gotten compliments from customers and extra tips though I was just a busser. Before I worked that one day where 2 people didn't show up for work I only had one day work out of the entire month last month and I didn't have days this month. The servers I worked with really liked me and were super grateful I was able to cover 2 people.

Also, I spoke to my boss multiple times over text and asked why I was only getting one day and why my hours were decreasing. She ignored my texts all the time and out of the blue this morning tells me I'm fired in a group chat to try and embarrass me and lie. I told her it was unprofessional and she could have spoken to me one on one.  Because she wanted all the other employees to look at me differently. It was straight up bullying and I wasn't tolerating it. There were other employees that showed up late all the time and caused issues but she never outed them in a group chat about it.  If my performance was bad none of my  co workers would have complimented me and I wouldn't have gotten any tips from customers. I was a little rusty because I had one day for the entire month of April so I had to get back into the routine of things for just one day in May  when I worked this shift considering that I was covering for 2 people as well. She only poked fun at me in the group chat for made up mistakes when tons of other employees made mistakes and she never once posted it in the work group chat to try and embarrass them in front of everyone. I had to file for partial unemployment in April because she only gave me 1 day for that entire month and it was not enough and I think this is a reason why she held animosity for me because it's working out for me. I documented everything since I started working there and nothing she says adds up.  She had multiple employees that would always call out, show up to work late, slack off etc. I was always doing my best and trying to help customers and yet she singles me out. If any of you relate to this please share your opinions. I am still so upset about this I couldn't even go back to sleep after being woken up by her text at 4am in the morning.",777,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1kjyjoc/boss_wrongfully_terminated_me_and_made_sure_to_do/,1746961709.0,pikapara,1kjyjoc,advice_seeking
antiwork,boss is a bully,Walked out this morning,"Been at this place a year, factory work, easier job I’ve ever had. Ten hour of looking through a microscope, paid weekly, three days off- every weekend. Sounds great on paper, right? But the people? The environment? Most toxic place I’ve ever been. They’re all bored. They all seem to hate their lives. Everyday was constant doom and gloom and negativity. Not to mention the pervasive sexism as it was very much a “boys club” type place. I let a lot of shit slide. Today was not that day. I’ve dealt with bullying before but this one…. When I tell you I’m still reeling from how insane it was?!

See, I’ve got ptsd from severe trauma and abuse. I take medication for this, I see a therapist… it’s super documented. But I’ve never disclosed it to my HR because it’s never impeded my work. If I’m having a really bad night, I can take my anxiety medication, wouldn’t be the first time. Minus tonight. I’ve got this supervisor whose favorite childish game is scaring people. He did this to me in the past, intentionally did something to startle me and I had a panic attack and asked him not to do that because it’s triggering, and that I have ptsd. He seemed to be understanding of it at the time. Maybe he forgot idk but the previous night when I was walking past him, he made a jump at me like when you’re going to fake hit someone and I flinched super hard and shrieked and he giggled about it while I had a whole panic attack and had to take my medication for- which is essentially a sedative so after I take it I become incredibly groggy and it’s hard for me to do my job. I really didn’t want to make a big stink about it because previously when I’ve dealt with bullying, they made fun of me and mocked me to others for being “too sensitive” so I tried to talk to him about it tonight, as a reminder to please not startle me because it causes episodes. 

Tell me why this man proceeded to act incredulous, like I insulted him in the worst way imaginable. Asked me “are you serious, I hope you’re not serious because if you are we’ve gotta have a talk with “big boss” on Monday because I clearly shouldn’t have a job and should just be on disability” I told him I was serious about my request and again tried to explain things to him and he became outraged by this. He made a comment about how he just won’t come near me because god forbid he scare me. I told him, that’s not what I said or what I meant. He was getting louder and louder and of course, I went into meltdown mode and started crying. He proceeded to walk past me with our other supervisor and tell him, “see, there she goes again with her drama and crying” so I took my badge off and handed it to him and told him he’s the reason their company can’t keep good employees. He told me “let’s consider this your resignation then, let’s go punch out and I’ll walk you out.” We exchanged some heated words on the way out where I asked him why he couldn’t just have apologized and just not do it again and that he lacks the ability to hold himself accountable for stuff he does wrong, like being a bully. He condescendingly called out to me to have a great weekend and I yelled back he could go fuck himself.

Talked to my therapist about this today and she said I should still call and report it to HR and see what they would like to do. And if that doesn’t work, take it to the EEoc. I know nothing about this stuff. I’ve never dealt with anything like this and now my anxiety from my ptsd is through the roof. Does anyone have any advice? Or maybe just some kind words? I feel terrible and everything about this feels wrong. ",452,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1k7mwe4/walked_out_this_morning/,1745592755.0,lestalkaboutitok,1k7mwe4,advice_seeking
antiwork,boss is a bully,Boss attempting to bully me (a highschooler) to work hours I don't want to work.,"It started last week when I left a note (as everyone else in our store does) on my managers desk saying I no longer want to work Sundays as I need time to do homework and to focus on my wellbeing, as well as to enjoy my youth essentially.

  
Got a phone call yesterday. She calls me and essentially refused and said that I will be given Monday off instead.  She told me that they were too understaffed to allow my Sundays off and that she hired me with my current availability in mind. 

  
That's not what I asked for; that's also not my problem. YOU need to figure that out because that is a management issue and if you don't then I'm quitting (I should have said this) 

  
At the time I was caught so off guard that I just said OK and ended the call. Going to go in tomorrow and say that either I get my sundays off or I'm gonna quit. Although I'm contemplating whether I should do a 2 weeks' notice or not.

  
2 weeks or just flat out quit? My parents suggested just put in the 2 weeks and deal with it to not burn any bridges, but they also said at the end of the day it is up to me. 

UPDATE: Hi everyone. It’s the next day. My managers (both of them) were not here. The customer service desk said to wait until they are here tomorrow; alas I did not. I left a note stating that if I cannot be given Sundays off, then my 2 weeks notice will be effective 10/24.

They should be here tomorrow. I can hopefully give a better resolution of what happened then.

Thank you all! 

FINAL UPDATE: Worked it out. Working this weekend then im done for sundays. Thank god.

antiwork,boss is a bully,Just got fired for arguing my right to occasionally sit down,"I want to vent. Sorry for the length.

I started working in a closed door pharmacy this past December. Job was fine, I picked things up quickly and worked as hard as anyone else there. Got praise from the bosses and no complaints.

It's important to note that we had predictable lulls throughout the day, and a big part of the job was doing script input (which is just typing). As such, we would all often sit between 5-30 mins at a time, either doing input, looking at documents, or whatever else didn't require standing/walking. As soon as there was standing work to be done, we would stand up and do it. This was never an issue. People had told me that the PIC (pharmacist in charge, basically a DM who worked in another state) hated people sitting down, but she hadn't visited the pharmacy since I started and apparently didn't care enough to enforce the no-sitting rule when she wasn't there in person. 

Now, the DM was directly in charge of our little team, but not of the rest of the workers in the pharmacy. The PM (pharmacy manager) managed the entire pharmacy, us included, but we reported mostly to the DM because of our business-within-a-business deal. I say all this because nearly everyone in the building wore comfy casual wear (sweatpants, leggings, etc) and sat down for most of the day. Because they were doing, you guessed it, mostly input. And as we were closed door, we had zero customers. No one was allowed in except employees and authorized visitors. Overall, the place was pretty unprofessional.

Some more important info - I masked every day, but because nobody else masked and everyone came in sick constantly, I got covid for the first time mid-January and had to miss about 1.5 weeks of work. Management acted very understanding.
Early February I asked to take off a couple days (mostly unpaid because lack of PTO) to take my cat in for surgery. They tried to guilt me into not taking off but eventually agreed. Then, last week, my mom had to go to the hospital. I missed one day of work.

Also last week, our DM and HR laid off one of our pharmacists. They said that our workload didn't warrant a team of our size (which was untrue). They gave her, a single mom, two days notice, and forced her to finish out the week to get her severance. 

This Monday, our DM showed up to do exit paperwork with the pharmacist who was laid off. DM decided to stay until Wednesday. Monday and Tuesday were alright. DM was micromanaging us, but it was tolerable. Lots of talk about new trainings, what we needed to get set up for expansion, live individual feedback, and so on. By all accounts, my position with the company was solid. But on Wednesday, things went south. DM and I had the following interaction:

Me: *Sits down bc I'm just doing a bunch of input*

-A couple minutes later-

DM: Where'd the stool come from?

Me: Over there. *points to the side* It's always here.

DM: I don't think sitting is really appropriate.

Me, confused and irritated: But you were sitting on it two days ago?

-There was a collective pause in the room. Nobody liked that-

DM, obviously pissed off: Yeah, but you and I are not the same, friend.

Me, absorbing the fact that she really just said that:.....it doesn't impact my job if I'm just doing input.

DM: You don't think so?

Me: No. I can type just fine sitting down and that's all I'm doing right now. Once I finish this, I'll stand back up for my other tasks.

DM: Well I just think it's kind of unprofessional.

I didn't respond and continued to sit. Nothing else was said on the matter until I came back from lunch. The DM was gone because her visit had finally ended, and I decided to bring up what she had said about us being ""different"" to my coworkers. Rather than commiserate together as we all had many times before, my coworkers began chastising me. The remaining pharmacist said that the DM and I ""*are* different"", and that she couldn't believe I said what I did. I tried to tell her that the DM not wanting us to sit was nothing but an ego trip, but she wasn't having it. 

I noticed a few minutes later that the stool was nowhere to be found. I had a creeping feeling that the DM wasn't going to let our argument go.

I spoke with another coworker at the end of the day to explain my actions better; I said we shouldn't allow management to bully us into physical discomfort, that sitting had absolutely no impact on our ability to do input, that sitting when the work allowed it was a fought-for right around the world. She stayed neutral and said she was worried about me and to be careful (and that I had balls, which cheered me up a bit). 

Yesterday everything was fairly normal. Coworkers were more quiet than usual. I could tell they probably blamed me for the new and distinct lack of seating options. When lunch came around I said fuck it and headed to Walmart. Got a $15 folding stool. I debated getting everyone one but decided against it. Got back and carried my stool into the pharmacy and set it up when input time came. Took maybe 15 mins for the pharmacist to notice. She started questioning me, asking where I got the stool, if I remembered what the DM had said the day before, if I just didn't care. I was about to reply when the PM showed up and aggressively and loudly said that we were no longer allowed chairs and that the one I was sitting on needed to go. I paused, feeling everyone staring at me. The room was dead silent. I took a breath and slowly stood up. The PM thanked me, grabbed the box of n95 masks I had asked the inventory guys to order for me (as an added fuck you I guess?), and marched off. I folded up my stool and placed it beside my station. I stood there, staring at my computer, not really seeing anything. To my right were the inventory guys, sitting. To my left were rows of the PM's people, sitting. Everyone had cushy, ergonomic chairs, and I was just forbidden a shitty little stool from Walmart. My coworkers said nothing.

Towards the end of the day I noticed that my coworkers were missing. I went to investigate and heard them in the conference room with the PM. The door was closed so I couldn't make out much. I immediately went back to my station and gathered my few items, emailed all my important documents to myself, etc. Then I began working again like nothing happened. After a while my team came back and also acted like nothing happened. It was both funny and infuriating. After an hour or so I casually asked my pharmacist what the meeting was about. She tried to play dumb and then just stopped responding, which was extremely out of character for her. I knew then that I was getting fired and she had been informed. At the end of the day, when it was just me and the coworker who said she was worried about me, I asked her if coming in today would be a waste of gas. She said she hadn't heard anything about me getting fired but warned me to not call out. I didn't know whether to believe her or not, but I told her I wouldn't call out and left for the night. I sent a text to my pharmacist asking her to give me a heads up if she happened to hear anything . She didn't respond.

Today I went in. Things were normal, if a bit tense. Everyone worked and nobody sat. It was getting towards the end of the day when the PM came by and asked to speak with me in the conference room. That wasn't how the pharmacist had been fired last week, so I wasn't sure if I was going to get fired too or just given a warning. I sat down (nice) and was put on a three way call with the DM and HR. The DM said I was being let go because of my excessive absences. They asked if I had any questions, and I told them that if they wanted people to call out less, they needed to start enforcing their masking policy (I should have asked why I wasn't getting their standard two day firing notice) . The PM left to get my stuff from my station. When he came back everyone asked me if anything was missing. I almost laughed when I said I needed my stool. The PM went and got it. He then walked me out and, despite not once misgendering me since I put my pronouns on my badge, referred to me as ""she"" to the DM on the phone as the front door was closing behind me.

antiwork,surviving my job,"The Trump election cost me my job. No, seriously. ","The election results had been bad enough on their own. It kept me awake at night the past few days but I was still able to console myself. I had a job, I had a good support system and good insurance. Surely I could drown out the impending misery of the 4 years to come by burying myself in work right? 

  
Wrong. I got pulled into a call this morning by HR with my boss. They did the whole schtick of ""we value for your time and effort and loyalty blah blah blah but with the Trump election and incoming tariffs and uncertainty in the economic future we have to downsize and thus we are ending your employment effective immediately blah blah blah""

The worst part? I had been working closely with my boss for the past few months towards earning a promotion. I wanted to earn it and my boss and I had made a roadmap of tasks and  new duties so I could EARN a promotion by the end of the year. I was well on track and not just surviving but thriving! 

  
Everything was going smoothly. Had Harris won the election, I sincerely doubt this would have happened. Maybe I am wrong, who knows. It would be super stupid to blame this on the Trump administration but hey, that was the HR person's words. Not mine. 

  
I am not asking for pity, or money, lawyers, or even assistance in job hunting. Right now, I just needed this time to think and wanted a place to rant.

antiwork,surviving my job,I just quit my job over email… after being the last one left from 3 layoffs,"I just resigned (over email) and I feel so guilty about it, even though I don’t think I had much choice.

I survived 3 waves of redundancies at my company. We used to have 4 developers, 1. Tech lead and 1 PM. Last Friday, my final coworker in the department was given his notice of redundancy, which means it’s now going to be just me after his notice period. At first, I felt lucky to still have a job, but after I reflected on the situation, I realised I’ve been feeling completely drained and mentally wrecked. I’ve been working late nights, promised bonuses that never came, and carrying a workload that was meant for an entire team.

I had a meeting scheduled with my manager on Monday to talk things through, but it never happened. I tried reaching out unofficially, but no luck. In the end, I just sent the resignation email because I couldn’t keep waiting, and now I feel like I left in the worst possible way.

Part of me feels bad because I know the company is struggling, but the other part of me knows that staying here is destroying my mental health. I can’t shake the guilt, though.

Did I do the wrong thing by resigning via email? Has anyone else felt this way after leaving a toxic situation?

UPDATE:
My colleague just got a meeting invite with the manager and HR. However, he has already signed his redundancy notice with the severance package confirmed and has no intention of continuing to work for them.

antiwork,constantly overworked,Quit my job at this toxic company. Now HR wants to talk. How honest should I be?,"Hey so I recently submitted my resignation letter and HR asked me right away if there was a chance to have a call soon. I hadn't replied yet since I wanted to think this through and be prepared first. So here's the background: I started working at this company only a few weeks ago, after which I fell ill (I'm currently on sick leave). Right in the beginning I noticed so many red flags that I immediately knew that I wouldn't wanna stay here. And when I say red flags I mean a toxic work environment mainly created by a toxic management which consists of a yelling boss who constantly gaslights and emotionally abuses his employees. Staff is super overworked and overstressed, Also, the bookkeeping is a huge mess but yea, that's actually just the tip of the iceberg.

I didn't talk to anyone about considering quitting, I also never complained about anything, so this might be surprising for my team but tbh, why should I care. I already heard that the turnover rate is very high, so.. yea. Actually.. It shouldn't be surprising at all. Now my question is: What could HR possibly ask and how honest should I be? On one hand, I wanna be upfront (in a professional manner of course), on the other hand I just wanna leave in peace, I don't even want to have a 1:1 talk with the boss. So if they ask for my reasons maybe I'd just tell them that I found another profession and this company just isn't a fit for me but Idk. What would you guys do? Anyone with similar experiences?

EDIT: Hey guys, thank you so much for all your input and helpful advice! After going through all the comments I just wanna clarify a few things: My notice period within the probationary period is two weeks, you cannot quit on the spot (I'm not from the US btw). So while I do agree with most of you that you don't owe HR or anyone in that company your time after leaving, I agreed on having this call since I wasn't officially out yet. And what can I say, I worried for nothing lol. HR didn't even ask me about my reasons for quitting. They're probably used to it and already heard it all. It was just for their paperwork. I'm glad I'm outta here. ",186,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1g3gf1x/quit_my_job_at_this_toxic_company_now_hr_wants_to/,1728914323.0,redwanderpanda,1g3gf1x,advice_seeking
antiwork,constantly overworked,Told boss to sue me on my way out,"I was a junior/mid-level engineer at a small tech startup with 2 founders and a team of 20. Place was a mess - constant drama, toxicity, miscommunication, no leadership, backstabbing and gossip. Everyone was overworked and underpaid.

I tried to fix things but ended up clashing with some coworkers and management came after me. I fought back and to be fair probably went a bit overboard. Even people who had my back said I was too assertive and agressive.

When I quit, the boss asked that I return my bonuses. I said no and told him to sue me to get them. Long story short, I left on bad terms.

They seemed to be timid people who put up an intimidating front and got insecure when I dominated the conversations. They probably see me as an aggressive jerk, but all I did was stand up for myself (and even others to a fault) and push back against their BS.

I was unemployed for a while afterwards. Found a job in February, but the project was suspended and we were laid off.

antiwork,constantly overworked,The person training me left on maternity leave. I have to pick up where she left off. Insanely overworked office and I don't know what to do.,"I took a job offer late March for a medical billing office. We handle medical billing requests, enter charges, and send them out to law offices. I quickly learned how overworked and insane this office's workload is. Its constant emails from a ton of medical providers, tons of emails from attorneys requesting docs, excel sheets due for multiple people weekly, etc.

 Sounds simple but the sheer amount of time it takes to put together files, create health insurance claim forms, all for a ton of doctors for each day of the week is insanity. Think of the most tedious work that takes forever to do for 1 assignment, but up that by 10 more assignments and they are all pressing issues. on top of law firms emailing you, calling you, requests from other coworkers. Its too much. We are in the middle of transferring from 1 software to another and the IT in charge is fumbling it hard.

The person training me told me she was going on maternity leave late May but her doctor advised her to be induced this coming first week of may. My training was suddenly cut short, i was rushed to finish on training how to handle specific doctors, now today was her last day and im thrown to the wolves. Im sitting here writing this post because in all honesty im stressed. My trainer told me early on that this place is overworked and if i handle stress well. I was honest and said im looking for another job - preferably in a law office since im finishing up a paralegal studies degree. She was supportive of me leaving asap and said she was trying to leave as well.

Well, now that she is gone and i am absolutely clueless on how im supposed to take this person's workload. My manager is clueless as well. I asked for help soon after my trainer left and my manager was just as clueless as I am. The ONLY person who knew our side of the office's operations is gone. I was hired with 2 other people and they both mysteriously stopped showing up at the same time. I believe they were fired since i was told they've fired new hires before.

 Why this place thought they could hire someone and throw this one someone is beyond me. It would be different if any other coworkers knew my side of the operations but everyone is literally clueless so asking for help is moot. I have no help because they literally cannot help.

The place is a circus. Oh, and this job pays $16 a fucking hour. I only took it because I could not bear any more time unemployed in this job market. I have savings, i live at home, im extremely lucky to have a support system after shit hit the fan for me a bit back. So im not dying, but im not exactly living either. I count my blessings though.

So, reddit. Im considering not even coming back Monday. I really dont want to be unemployed but im already stressed the fuck out and dont think i can hang on any longer here. I am drowning in work and i dont give a fuck about a place doing this to someone.

antiwork,constantly overworked,Shitty paying job constantly increasing work load.,"How do you deal with this as an anxious person. 

I’m only at this job temporarily while I’m finishing school and searching for something better.

It pays so poorly, yet the management is constantly expecting more and more and more. 

And I just find it so frustrating, because it’s like, very obvious that the management knows they’re over working us, they say it all the time yet it’s like okay here’s more. 

I struggle with just knowing how shitty of a work environment it can be, I literally have customers telling me “it seems like they’re overworking you/taking advantage of you”.

antiwork,constantly overworked,Left a toxic remote job mid-way and still feeling anxious about it,"Hi everyone,
I recently left a company that was overworking and exploiting me. It was a remote position, and they kept piling tasks on me that weren’t even in my area of expertise. I told them that I wanted to quit, that it was too much work, but they kept insisting I ""just finish the month"" or offered me things like ""flexible hours"" or ""more pay"" so I thought I'd rather finish the month, get paid and then leave. But the way they started piling work on me didn't seem like they were gonna let me go soon.

Eventually, I couldn’t take it anymore and stopped responding to them. I blocked them, and honestly, the moment I stopped replying, I felt so much lighter and could finally focus on my own work.

Whenever they call me from a new number or stalk my social profiles (LinkedIn, Fiverr, etc.), I get a huge wave of anxiety, any reminder of them instantly puts me on edge. I felt them in between, didn't give them the ongoing files either, just leaving them without saying anything felt like a better decision otherwise they would've kept bothering me.

They act all nice but they don't listen. At the end of my work hours they'd ask, ""just this much foe today?"" It made me so angry. I was finishing more work than others in less amount of time. They would give me tasks that weren't in my expertise and when I'd tell them they'd say just do them however you can. 

I don't know why I feel guilty for leaving in between and not giving them the files. They gave me unfinished work from other employees  many times from which I suspect many others were leaving too. I don't have contact with anyone of them though.

I don't even want the money! Just leave me alone! The worst part is that they don't think they did anything wrong and I should just talk to them to resolve the issue. They think that's how things work. And yeah a alot of companies are doing that. But that doesn't make it okay. They keep on calling from different numbers. I don't know what account they're using to stalk my social media. But whenever I upload something they start calling. It's a nightmare! I know I should just ignore it but it's giving me so much anxiety.

Has anyone else gone through something like this—leaving a toxic job mid-way, blocking all contact, but still feeling anxious about it? How did you fully let go and stop feeling like they might pester you again?

Sorry if this all sounds stupid. But that work just left me with so much anxiety that I'm getting paranoid. With them stalking me on social media and calling me constantly, they seem crazy. I don't want to contact them again and tell them to leave me alone. The fact that where I live this isn't considered such a huge issue doesn't make it any better. 

The whole time I was working for them, I felt miserable. I kept saying things like, ""This isn’t my area of expertise,"" ""Please stop stacking more work on me,"" ""My hours are over, I can’t do more,"" or ""This task isn’t simple; it will take time and there’s no faster way to do it."" I found myself repeating these things almost every other day, but it was like they never truly listened. And yet, I still feel guilty for leaving I'm between and not giving them the files so they can give someone else to finish the work. 

I hate that I'm feeling this way. The moment I start to feel better they suddenly call with the different number. I ignore it and block it. The fact that we are told that this is normal and we have to go through all this in order to earn and survive. It's crazy. I'm doing my own work now, I get my own clients, decide my own rates, keep my own deadlines. It's not much right now but the peace of mind that I have because of this. I won't trade it for any other work honestly.",10,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1mc4ib4/left_a_toxic_remote_job_midway_and_still_feeling/,1753771966.0,spciallyanxious96,1mc4ib4,advice_seeking
antiwork,constantly overworked,I finally realized I was being taken advantage of,"I’m a 17-year-old high school student who has worked throughout high school. I’ve been at Harris Teeter for a year and a half. I recently quit my job there—and my other job as a server—to work at Walmart for $15 an hour. Starting this summer, I’ll also take on a second job.

So, why did I quit Harris Teeter?

One of my coworkers, who does the work of three people, earns just $14 an hour. He even made less than I did as a cashier at one point. Despite being promoted to CS Clerk, he still has to juggle roles as a bagger, cashier, personal shopper, and CS Clerk. He only earns 60 cents more than me despite all that extra responsibility.

Then there’s my best friend, who works in two departments—bagging, cashiering, and helping in the deli. He earns $15 an hour, but deli employees with far fewer responsibilities make the same.

Meanwhile, Harris Teeter constantly overworks its high school employees. During the holidays, my coworkers and I regularly worked 8–10 hour shifts, which I thought was just how jobs worked. I was shocked when my new Walmart manager told me they don't allow high schoolers to work 8-hour shifts during the school year.

That’s when it hit me: I’d been taken advantage of.

North Carolina has some of the weakest labor laws in the country, and Harris Teeter takes full advantage of that. They’re notoriously anti-union, and my manager’s reputation for enforcing company priorities over employee wellbeing is known across the district.

Looking back, I should’ve left sooner. But I’ve learned an important lesson: Know your rights and value your time. If you’re being overworked and underpaid, there are better opportunities—you just have to look for them.",189,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1hpww5e/i_finally_realized_i_was_being_taken_advantage_of/,1735591202.0,LateDoughnut03,1hpww5e,advice_seeking
antiwork,don't know what to do with my life,I don't know how anyone manages a 40 hour + work week,"(using an alt because I really don't want this traced back to me)

I am 2 weeks into a new corporate job. It's the kind of job that is probably considered 'good' by most people; pay is adequate, company is known, position is stable etc. But I'm absolutely dying inside. 

I no longer have any free time, what time I do get is usually spent just trying to catch up on chores and sleeping. To make matters worse my roster has me on revolving weekends, meaning once a month I work 6 days a week. I just literally don't have a life anymore. I wake up, commute an hour and a half to work, do my 8 to 9 hour shift (if I'm lucky) and then commute the same amount right back (3 hours a day all up). By the time I get home it's dinner time, and then I have to get my stuff ready for the next day. By 9:30 pm I'm too tired to do anything but go to sleep and start the day over again. 

In a single 24 hour weekday cycle I have on average 4 hours a day to just exist without work. What's the point of 'decent' pay if I don't have time to even use any of it?

Edit: Since it's a commonly asked question in the comments I'll answer it here. I can't move any closer to the job as it's in the middle of a very unaffordable city. Rent where I live is ridiculous, even for less appealing properties. Which is down to greedy landlords, and a lot of eligible housing being used for air bnbs, but that's another topic entirely.

Edit 2: Wow, I wasn't expecting this tired little rant to take off so much. It's basically impossible to keep up with comments but I thank everyone for all the advive they've given. Also I'm a woman for those of you who assumed. I just thought being a career woman was a good idea...

antiwork,don't know what to do with my life,Tired of working and only 27,"Anyone else feel like they're already burnt out and they haven't even hit 30 yet? I've been grinding since college, went straight into a decent job after graduation, and now I'm sitting here wondering if this is really it for the next 40 years.

Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful to have steady income and all that, but man the routine is killing me. Wake up, commute, sit at a desk for 8+ hours, commute back, maybe squeeze in some dinner and Netflix, then repeat. Weekends fly by doing errands and trying to recover enough energy for Monday.

I see older coworkers who seem content with this setup and I genuinely don't understand how they do it. Maybe I'm just naive or expecting too much from life, but there has to be more than this right? Sometimes I think about just saying screw it and trying something completely different, but then reality hits and bills need to get paid.

The worst part is feeling guilty for complaining when I know plenty of people have it worse. But that doesn't make the existential dread go away when my alarm goes off every morning.

antiwork,don't know what to do with my life,Showed up for my first day and nobody knew who I was or why I was there :/,"Was told in my job offer letter that I'd be given details for my first day/on-boarding process, which I never received. I showed up a bit early to my new manager's office and waited around, nothing. Then a supervisor from another department does a double take: ""can I help you?"". I explain why I'm here and she looks dumbfounded and is desperately working with another person to figure out who I am or why I'm here. She says ""yeah, \[manager\] and \[scheduling manager\] aren't here today, so..."". I explain I'm on the schedule and today is my first day, which she then confirms.

By this point I'm already extremely annoyed but being professional and polite, talking humor of the situation. She ends up giving me a uniform and throwing me on somebody in my department to shadow. There's no training, no introductions, I'm just waiting for instructions from people who don't know who I am or really know what tasks to give me. I also found out that there's no end time for our shifts, only start times. ""Sometimes you can be here until 3am"" I was told later by a supervisor. I do my time that day and go home.

Fast forward and there's a message in our department communication platform from the manager with a big list of people, including me, which says ""I want all of you on this list to have all of your overdue training completed by your next shift and you'll stop by my office to show it to me. Disappointing list..."". Reading that honestly set me off. I'm pissed. First off, you give me no instructions and ghost me on my FIRST DAY and I'm thrown to the wolves with no onboarding process whatsoever? Then you expect me and others to do that work training *on my own time, unpaid*, with a passive aggressive attitude to boot? Not happening.

I'm only getting a shift or two a week here anyway (I have another job), but I'm wondering if it's worth bringing up to HR? Idk, that first day was a total red flag for me, totally unacceptable coming from a huge company. I'm just so tired of being taken advantage of for minimum wage pay. I might just hand in my notice -- effective immediately -- and be done with it. Life's too short.

Thanks for listening!",1004,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1gde8qx/showed_up_for_my_first_day_and_nobody_knew_who_i/,1730044855.0,sillysully931,1gde8qx,advice_seeking
antiwork,don't know what to do with my life,Taking a 2 month leave starting today. Didn't tell my boss until I was supposed to start my shift.,"Just need to rant here. I'm so tired.

I'm a manager at an extremely busy fast food chain. When I say ""extremely busy"" I mean $10k-$12k in sales every day. The owners recently opened another location nearby and I transferred there for a bit of a change. Probably a mistake in hindsight, but anyways, the layout is a lot different than what I'm used to at other locations. Namely, the store is streamlined in such a way that they purposely try to limit the amount of staff that can work at once.

The owners and district manager have been repeatedly hammering home the point that we need to meet our labour goals and that because the store is designed for maximum efficiency, you ""don't need more than 3 people working at a time."" Well, that's basically impossible and has been adding on an insane amount of stress. I somehow always get the short end of the stick: get scheduled new trainees who don't know anything (and I can't train them properly because I have to do multiple positions), have little to no staff during my shifts, unable to find anyone who can come in, etc.

I have a lot of things going on in my personal life and was diagnosed with clinical depression about ten years ago. I usually manage it with medication just fine, but I realize now that I have been bottling up my stress, anxiety, and depression from the last few months. I told my general manager/boss about this after I ended up missing two shifts a few weeks ago. I told her that it's not fair for us to be constantly understaffed and begged her to put an extra person on, even just for a few hours. I'll give you a guess as to whether or not she changed the schedule. Her answer for managing my stress was to just switch me to another shift. I made it known that I intended to take a leave ""sooner rather than later"" but gave no specific dates.

Today I was able to see my doctor for a same day appointment. I answered a pre-appointment questionnaire about my mental health and she said the answers were ""extremely alarming"" and signed off for two months of leave effective immediately. I texted my boss and told her about the situation and have received no response. She is usually very quick in responding and understanding, but I guess this is where her courtesy ends.

Now I'm feeling a little guilty because I know this throws a wrench in the entire schedule and I'm essentially putting my coworkers in the same position I didn't want to be in and I am possibly jeopardizing my job, but at the same time I can't bring myself to care anymore. I have been degraded and minimized and treated like dirt by this company for seven years now. Though I know by now that all companies are the same, I'm hoping that during my leave I can find another job, regardless of the pay or hours",689,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1jv05s5/taking_a_2_month_leave_starting_today_didnt_tell/,1744184205.0,samedreamsamenight,1jv05s5,advice_seeking
antiwork,career change at 30/40,"Shame, guilt, and the rigged game of modern life","Here's a little secret. Your parents were full of shit.

Now, I don't mean maliciously. They meant well, of course. But if they ever told you your disappointment because you're not rich and famous or solving climate change by age 30, they were working off a script that hasn't been updated since rotary phones. Now, those of you who don't know what rotary phones are, Google is your friend.

So, the truth is, you're not a disappointment. You're just stuck playing a game that's so rigged, even the house can't figure out the rules anymore. And meanwhile, you're up at 3:00 a.m. scrolling LinkedIn, staring at Brad from college who's humble bragging about his new job in synergistic innovation, optimization, whatever the hell that is. And maybe you're thinking, ""Did I miss a memo on how to be an adult?"" But the reality is probably more something like this. Brad's also lying awake, doom-scrolling web MD, wondering if his back pain is cancer or just from the way he got up from that chair yesterday.

So, welcome to the modern human experience. A place where everyone's putting on a show and nobody remembers the plot or how the plot goes anymore.

Okay, so let's talk about pressure. And I don't mean the kind that makes diamonds. I mean, the kind that makes you have a panic attack while you're trying to choose a brand of peanut butter, which I know sounds completely trivial and ridiculous, but just stick with me here. So, we've built a society where success is defined as superhuman achievement. Your parents wanted you to succeed. Their parents wanted them to succeed. Except the definition of success keeps getting upgraded like an iPhone you can't afford. And meanwhile, the means to reaching that success just keep getting more and more difficult.

So once upon a time success meant get a job, build a career, buy a house, get married, have kids, yada yada, right? And now it's build your personal brand, disrupt multiple industries, achieve work life balance while journaling about your gratitude, actually get enough sleep and so forth.

Okay. So, the American Psychological Association says anxiety among young young adults has shot up 30% since 2007 and depression among teenagers is up 60%. But hey, you know, let's keep telling kids they can be anything they want, as though anything doesn't now require a Harvard MBA, three unpaid internships, and an emotional support animal.

Okay. So, French sociologist Jean Baudrillard would have been thrilled at this. You know, we're living in his hyper reality. A place where the illusion of success has become more important than the actual success. And we are actors performing for an audience that's also performing for us. And nobody knows what the original script was. It's basically a pyramid scheme except instead of money, the currency is anxiety.

Now, here's where it gets really good. While we're all trying to cosplay as successful adults online, the real economic data reads like a rejected Black Mirror episode for being too bleak. So since 1979, worker productivity has gone up 70%. But wages only went up 12%. And CEO pay up over 1,000%. So, you're working harder than your parents ever did. You're probably more educated than your grandparents were. And yet, you are still checking your bank account before deciding whether you can afford guacamole.

Don't worry, though, there's an app for that. You know, actually, there's 17 apps for that, all all designed to help you budget your way out of structural inequality, which we're going to talk about in a minute here. And you know, meanwhile, the top 1% of US citizens owns 40% of the wealth. the bottom half of the country, now wait for it, they own a whopping 2%. But sure, your financial problems are probably because you bought too many lattes or whatever. You know, Dave Ramsey said so, and obviously he's never been wrong about anything.

Okay, sarcasm aside. So, economists call this structural inequality. I prefer to call it economic gaslighting. It's like telling someone they're drowning because they're bad at swimming while you're pouring cement into the pool. And you know, here's where the here's the the real head trip. Deep down, we all know the game is rigged, but we keep playing anyway because the alternative is admitting the American dream has basically mutated into the American anxiety disorder.

All right. So, I've mentioned this guy before, the sociologist Zygmunt Bauman called this liquid modernity, meaning all the old structures we relied on have pretty much melted into uncertainty. Well, congrats, Zygmunt. You nailed it. Because we're all dog paddling through a pool of liquid anxiety, trying to build solid lives out of soggy pool noodles.

Okay. enter social media, humanity's favorite group, hallucination. So, we've built these platforms where everyone's life looks like a pharmaceutical commercial. Slow motion shots of people running on beaches. you know, laughing over salads and then we wonder why we all feel like complete 💩.

Now, Facebook's own internal research found that Instagram increases rates of depression and anxiety, especially for teenage girls. Now, Facebook owns Instagram. And so their official response basically something along the lines of, ""Have you tried posting more inspirational quotes?"" And I'm only slightly exaggerating here.

The real absurdity is that we're all creating these perfect online lives so meticulously that we've forgotten what our actual lives look like. Now, you know, I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing, but it's what's happening. Your Instagram grid might have cinematic lighting worthy of a Marvel movie, but your real Tuesday probably involves crying in front of Excel and then eating Cheerios over the sink at midnight.

All right. So, the average person spends 2 and 1/2 hours a day on social media. That's 912 hours a year. I mean, that's practically a part-time job, except instead of getting a paycheck, you get to feel like a failure because your beach photos didn't rack up enough likes.

So, this reminds me of the French thinker Guy Debord, who coined the term society of the spectacle way back in 1967 and he he didn't even live long enough to see Tik Tok. So we are now living in a world where the representation of life has completely overshadowed life itself. Everyone's a brand now. Your grandma's on YouTube and your cat definitely has a better Instagram engagement rate than most small businesses.

You know, we're performing our lives instead of actually living them. And the performance reviews are written by algorithms that don't understand human joy, but they have plenty of opinions about engagement metrics. And so we end up living two lives. There's the curated version, you know, smiley brunches, inspirational career updates, humble brags about productivity hacks, travel bragging, etc. And then there's the real version. ice cream for breakfast, chronic dread, endless FOMO, and you know, wondering if you're permanently behind in life.

You know, the curated version claims to have unlimited PTO and something like a 10step skincare routine, but the real version is in debt and has a rash you keep hoping will just go away.

Okay, so studies say 61% of millennials feel lonely despite being the most connected generation in history. You know, we have more ways to communicate than ever, but somehow we're all speaking entirely different languages, primarily the language of performance versus the language of actual human experience.

It's like we're all wearing masks, but the masks have gotten so realistic, we've forgotten what our own faces look like underneath. Now, Carl Jung, he would have had a field day with all this if he weren't busy spinning in his grave.

And you know, the real mind is we know everyone else is faking it, too. But we still believe their performance while doubting our own reality. You know, this is human nature for you. It's kind of like watching a magician pull a rabbit out of a hat, even though we all know there's no rabbit. Just collective anxiety wearing bunny ears.

But here's the plot twist. There never was a rabbit. Just debt, insomnia, and depression in a fur costume.

Now, here's the tragedy. We're still playing by the system's rules, even though the system is clearly glitching like a cheap bootleg of the matrix. And we keep on measuring success through consumption as if the right combination of purchases will somehow fill the soul shaped hole that modern life drilled into us.

You know, consumerism has become our de facto religion. You know, the mall is the cathedral. Amazon Prime is our sacrament and unboxing videos are basically modern-day sermons. We effectively are worshiping at the altar of stuff convinced that eventually we'll buy the magic object that finally makes us feel satisfied, maybe even happy.

But you know the problem with materialism as a life philosophy is like pouring water into a bucket with a big hole in the bottom. Yeah.

Okay. So Tim Kasser was a well-known psychologist who discovered that people who prioritize materialistic values consistently report lower well-being. they have more anxiety and not surprisingly shittier relationships. And meanwhile the wealth gap keeps stretching like an old pair of underwear.

You know, the medium home price is up 400% since 1970, but medium income has only risen about 25%. So, we've got a generation told they could have anything they wanted, living in a world where they can't even afford basic shelter.

I see this as class warfare designed or disguised as personal failure. You're not broke because the system extracts wealth upward. You're broke because you didn't perfect your 5 a.m. morning routine. This is basically the narrative now. Thanks LinkedIn influencers. Super helpful.

Okay, so David Graeber wrote about jobs. You know, meaningless work that exists purely to keep us busy while real essential work goes underpaid or ignored altogether. And it turns out a lot of us are being paid to spin PowerPoint decks while teachers have to launch GoFundMes just to buy school supplies. But hey, at least middle management gets great dental coverage, right?

All right. So, what is our brilliant solution to feeling disconnected from human beings? Apparently, at this point in time, AI companions because, you know, obviously if real relationships are difficult, the logical move is to start emotionally bonding with algorithms trained on Reddit comments.

And look, I get it. AI, you know, it never forgets your birthday and it doesn't bail on plans. It won't judge you for crying during Pixar movies or for googling is my rash fatal in the middle of the night. It's kind of like having a best friend who's permanently stuck in polite customer service mode.

So, the market for AI companionship is projected to hit $9 billion by 2030. That's how lonely we've become. We are willing to pay real money for relationships with something that's made of an algorithm.

And you know, there are perks. Obviously, AI has no emotional baggage. It won't leave you for someone with better credit. It doesn't have a racist uncle who ruins family gettogethers. But replacing real human connection with artificial connection to me that seems like replacing an ear of corn with Doritos.

Well, look, in an effort to view this particular topic with some deeper critical thinking, it's dawning on me that there are a lot of people out there who are already relying on AI companionship in various ways. And you know whether we like it or not, our current reality has become so desperate and dysfunctional that people are turning to help from AI.

And you know, I've seen many people supporting this narrative.And look, you know, I understand. I've never personally I've never had the good fortune of having a good therapist and I know that AI is is providing some some help in in those areas for people.

Now I I understand it's debatable on how worthy that help is. Time will tell. You know, I mean, let's admit it. You know, the current state of human relationships is a dumpster fire. And AI relationships, they feel safe and reliable. Though, I'd still argue that they ultimately leave you feeling like you're eating a protein bar instead of a home-cooked meal.

In any case, this is very much a brave new world with a lot of unknowns right now, but we're there's no going back.

So, this segues nicely to the fact that we are smack in the middle of what researchers are calling an epidemic of loneliness. 

You know, now I've mentioned this before, but it bears repeating here. The US Surgeon General, the same guy who warns us about cigarettes, recently declared loneliness a public health crisis. Apparently, chronic isolation is as bad for you as smoking half a pack of cigarettes a day.

So the takeaway here is that even if you quit smoking, you might still die from loneliness. You know, we're hyperconnected online and utterly alone in real life. We know what people ate for breakfast, but most of us have no idea who to call when we're having a meltdown in the middle of the night.

And you know, we've got hundreds, maybe thousands of followers, but nobody to help us move a couch.

So, Robert Putnam wrote Bowling Alone back in 2000. and he was already documenting the collapse of social capital, declining church attendance, fewer union memberships, families drifting apart, uh people working in isolation, and so forth.

We've been atomizing for decades at this point, but now we've reached what I would call peak individualism. Everyone's, you know, a mini corporation managing their personal brand while quietly losing their minds.

So, the typical person in the US has fewer than two close friends. That's not even enough people to help you move furniture, let alone process the insanity of modern existence.

Our mental health stats read like horror fiction. Suicide rates are up 35% since 1999. Anxiety and depression have become so common. They're basically just background noise at this point.

And we've normalized mental illness because mental health requires social and economic conditions that don't really exist anymore. It's as if we built a society perfectly engineered to make people miserable and then we're shocked when people turn out miserable.

I'd say it's the civic equivalent of building houses out of matches and wondering why everything keeps catching fire.

Okay. So, well, what's the answer? Is there an answer? And that's debatable. but I, you know, whatever the case, I I hate to break it to you, it's not going to fit on a motivational poster, and it definitely can't be solved by downloading yet another app.

I think the answer might be as old as humanity itself. Smaller, tighter, more sustainable communities. you know, not necessarily an end of days extremist prepper way. Although, given the state of things, I wouldn't rule out a few canned beans and a water filter and maybe an occasional bunker full of supplies.

Okay, so Elinor Ostrom won a Nobel Prize for showing how small groups can manage shared resources without actually screwing each other over. And it turns out when people know each other and have to look each other in the eye, they're less likely to act like sociopaths.

I mean, go figure. Humans evolved in groups of about 150 people. That's Dunbar's number. We're simply not built to care deeply about thousands of strangers. We we're built to care deeply about a handful of people we actually see on a regular basis.

So maybe the real fix is in choosing connection over consumption and you know community over competition and actual relationships over social media networking.

I think it means living somewhere long enough to know your neighbors names and it means, you know, sharing meals instead of ordering Door Dash solo while binge watching Netflix series or whatever.

And maybe the antidote to modern misery is actually you know remembering how to be human which I understand is a very challenging situation in these times.

Okay, enough philosophizing. Let's talk potential solutions. Because I'm not here to try to bum you out. I'm here to just reveal some reality. That's what I prefer to call this.

But anyway, I would say in this situation the first thing I would suggest stop performing your life for strangers on the internet. You know, delete any app that consistency consistently makes you feel like Yes, including LinkedIn. and I I deleted mine last year and haven't missed it at all.

Um, number two, join something local and physical like a hiking club, a protest movement, I don't know, a community garden, a pickle ball league. Um, I'd recommend doing some volunteering. anything that puts you in the same room with other humans with you know shared interests.

And you know, bonus points if you're doing something helpful or creative.

Okay, number three, find work that doesn't make you want to hurdle yourself into traffic. I know that's a lot easier said than done these days, especially in this e, you know, current economic situation that we're in.

But I think even small steps towards meaningful work can make a difference. Now, personally, I would recommend self-employment if possible. you know, you'll probably work just as hard and as always there's no guarantees, but I think the work will be more meaningful.

And you know, I believe that it's not it's not always about the money. It's about, you know, your personal satisfaction with what you're doing.

Okay. Number four, learn to make or grow something with your own two hands like food, music, furniture, art, etc. You know, I believe creating tangible things helps counteract the abstract hellscape of modern life.

Plus, you'll have potentially useful skills when the apocalypse definitively arrives. if it hasn't already.

Okay. Number five, practice being bored. Seriously, just sit quietly for 20 minutes a day without your phone and just get used to being okay with not doing anything.

I think, you know, most of our issues these days come from running away from our own thoughts. And I think as hard as it may be, in the end, it's it's ultimately better to just turn around and try facing them instead.

Okay. In closing, look, I'm not pretending any of this is easy. You know, trying to go against the grain of a system that's designed to keep you exhausted and broke is like swimming upstream through lava.

I know from personal experience, and I know a lot of you know as well. But you know the alternative is this an endless cycle of shame and fake performance and quiet desperation.

Your parents weren't wrong for wanting more for you. They just didn't realize that more had been redefined by people who profit from keeping you dissatisfied.

And real success isn't having some fictitiously perfect life. I think it's having a life that feels worth living even if it's messy and imperfect and just borderline crazy.

You know the system might be rigged but we don't have to keep playing by its rules. I think we can try to choose connection over isolation and you know re reality over performance and ultimately I think we can choose enough over more and more and more.

And if that makes you a disappointment in somebody else's eyes, well, maybe their expectations were the problem all along.

Now, of course, none of these so-called solutions can guarantee anything will change. I see it as an exercise to try to counteract the hopelessness within. You know, it's too easy.

I see it as too one-dimensional for me to just slip into nihilism. So, you know, I'm trying to challenge myself by mixing it up with opposing opposing energies.

All right. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to delete a bunch of apps and figure out where and how to grow some chard because apparently that's what mental health looks like for me this year. ",66,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1m5phrs/shame_guilt_and_the_rigged_game_of_modern_life/,1753119529.0,Sandalwoodincencebur,1m5phrs,advice_seeking

**I have no idea what to do with my life.**

It's not an exaggeration at all to say that this has been a question I've been asking myself for 20 years, and I've yet to come up with an answer.

---

I was a good student, and really, a good kid. I didn't get in trouble. I didn't give my parents problems. I got good grades, without really trying. I was not obsessed with school. I rarely studied, or even put much effort into my homework -- most of the time, school just felt easy.

At the time this felt a bit unique, because many of my friends struggled with their grades and hated school. As I've gotten older, though, I've learned how common of an experience this was for ""gifted kids"", kids who were told how smart they were, that they could do whatever they wanted. Few of us, it seems, were actually gifted. As I've gone through life I'm actually, very often, confronted with how shockingly average I really am.

My sophomore, junior, and senior years of high school were all about planning for the future and thinking about careers. I thought I wanted to be an engineer. I planned for that. I thought about applying to multiple schools with good engineering programs, and was even recruited by one. In the end, I decided to do two years at the local community college and then transfer to one of them and finish out my degree.

It didn't happen. 

Instead, I did the first year, ""took a break,"" did one summer semester, and then quit. I started to change, in so many areas of my life -- to see the world differently. By the time a few semesters of college went by I was disillusioned. Every possible engineering career I could think of was going to make the world worse, not better. I started to see/feel a romance about a life of living on the edge, being a bit of a dirtbag, and started to think being some well-off douche with an office job would suck ass.

I also, legitimately, thought society was going to collapse -- sooner rather than later. I started to take an interest in survival skills, and living off the land. I started to read about ancient cultures, and pre-historic humans, and I started to thoroughly hate modern society, and existing within it.

At 37, and with 21 years of work history, I've worked a bunch of different jobs, in a bunch of different fields, with very different focuses. A few of them were your typical ""shit jobs,"" with shit bosses and shit co-workers, with terrible pay and no futures. Most of them, though, were actually not. Most of my bosses have actually been pretty good. Most of the work environments have been tolerable. The day-to-day hasn't been too bad.

But I still absolutely despise work.

Well, more accurate, I guess I despise *having to work*. I despise having to have a job, having to do that job, having to churn continuous income just to continue existing. 

Over the last few years I've looked back, and tried to understand where this hatred for ~~work~~ jobs came from, especially since my work history hasn't been pure misery. I've identified a few things.

I think one of the earliest things was watching *Office Space*. When I was in junior high school in the early 2000s, that movie used to play on Comedy Central almost constantly, and it would often be on when I came home from school. I don't think it's an exaggeration to say I've seen it probably 20 times in full, and significant portions of it 50+.

Peter's dissatisfaction with his job largely came from a lack of fulfillment, a daily test of tolerance for the mundane. The long and boring commute, the annoying co-workers, the meaningless tasks, the cubicles. It all painted a pretty clear picture of what life is *not* supposed to be for humans -- yet he was treated as if he was crazy by those around him for being miserable.

One of the most memorable points of the movie is when he recalls an exercise from school, about what he would want to do: ""**Nothing** ... I would do nothing.""

When I was around 19, and started reading a lot of philosophy, history, science, and anthropology, another insidious idea entered my young head. In hunter-gatherer cultures, it was said, no more than about three to five hours per day were dedicated to what we in the ""civilized"" world today would recognize as ""Work."" 

Three to five. Not ten, not twelve -- not even eight. Not 40 hours in a a five-day work week, but maybe 20-25.

How are people ""supposed"" to live again?

My father clearly had a very unhealthy relationship with his work. Still does. He worked very hard, as far as I could tell, and worked long hours. His field of choice had him working 60-80 hour weeks throughout much of his work season, and then he would be laid off in the winters. He would go out to the bars after work, and get home late -- oftentimes after we went to bed. We rarely saw him, and when we did, he was usually arguing with our mother.

They divorced when I was young. He moved hours away, to an area of the state where he would be able to make more money -- even though he had good, productive jobs where we lived. We saw him even less. Throughout our teens, when we would go see him, he'd pass along his wisdom through conversations in his truck. 

""Nobody likes their job,"" but ""Your job is your life."" You toil away for more and more money, to buy toys and pay child support to your bitch ex-wife. You buy your kids expensive gifts so they like you. But you hate your job; you always hate your job. Even when you're good at it, even when it's a good use of your talents. You hate it. Everyone hates their job.

My mother had a healthier relationship with work -- but it'd be hard to not have a healthier attitude *than that.* She kept her work weeks to the typical 40-hour week, with very rare overtime. But she regularly brought her work home with her. Literally, I have countless memories of seeing her sitting on the living room recliner with a pen and notepad, jotting down work stuff. Notes, schedules, conversations she needed to have. Hours of this, nearly every single night. Work stress clearly got to her, and she carried it with her nearly all the time.

She made much, much less money than my father -- probably by a factor of about three. But she was there for us, and she was good with her money. She taught us, by experience, about being frugal, about stretching a dollar, and about not throwing money away.

---

I've ""been"" many things, but none of my jobs (save one) have really brought me any identity or meaning. I've always dreaded the question of ""What do you do?"" because I've never identified with an occupation. What I have done for money has never felt like a cornerstone of my personality.

I've worked in restaurants, worked retail, tech support, customer service, landscaping, outdoor education. I've sat on my ass and observed rooms full of people, making sure no one does anything too idiotic. Most recently, for the past seven years, I've been mostly self employed. The past two or three I've been barely scraping by, through a combination of rideshare driving and selling archery supplies on eBay. And I'm just so ... *tired* of it all.

I've never made more than $20k a year. By and large that has been by choice. I've minimized the hours I've worked, and I've been (relatively) smart with my money. I go back to decisions I made in my early-20s, and yeah, I basically chose a life of poverty for myself. I continue choosing it, really. 

I can't realistically see myself going on any longer scraping by on $20k, never putting anything towards the future, and just getting ground into dust by the day-to-day. It's eating me up inside. It's straining my relationships. It's not sustainable. 

But I can't see another path. I know that I am at a crossroads, I know that I need to choose a different direction -- but I have no idea where to go, which direction to choose.

*I still have no idea what I want to do with my life.*

Through this odd but diverse collection of past jobs I've clearly accumulated some useful skills -- and through my hobbies, even more. Even with this truth, that I *know* to be true, I have no real idea of what I'm good at. I know that I can make bow-drill fires, and longbows from scratch; I can adjust the valve clearances on a motorcycle, follow a GPS, help someone change a password, and diffuse a tense situation -- but how the hell do these combine into one single job that I'm well-suited to?

---

Even if I knew what I wanted to do, who is going to give me *what I need* to do it?

At this point I've never had a singular full-time job in my life. There have been periods of my adult life that I've had two jobs, and the hours from both add up above 30-per-week -- but never 40. Or never 40 for long.

And I don't want that -- full stop, period. I never wanted the 40-hour-per-week job, and up to now I've avoided it. And yeah, I've been broke -- but not *too broke*.

At 37 I have no debt. Literally none. Zero. I have a $500 limit credit card that I pay off every single month that I got just to *have credit history*, but that I don't really need. I've paid for all of my vehicles with cash. I've never needed a loan for anything. I've never even had to borrow money from my parents, other family, or friends. So even with as little money as I've been making, I've been getting by. It's been ""working."" At one point I was even able to put a little in the bank every month, after my necessities were taken care of. It's been a while since then, though.

The biggest ""freedom"" I've found through the version of self-employment I've stumbled into has been freedom with my own time. I can take a random Tuesday off without having to ask for permission a month ahead of time. 

As time has gone by, though, I've started to realize that I've kind of lied to myself about this. So I'm kind of at a crossroads there, too. 

I've also been able to somewhat reliably earn >$20/hr doing this. I need to make more, though.

So through all of that rambling, and life story, I come to the title, and the crux of my issue.

**I wish someone would pay me a full-time salary for part-time work.** Like $30-per-hour for (up to) 30-hours-per-week.

It's a wish that's probably stupid. Stupid in its naivety, but also stupid in how obvious it is. *Yeah, we'd all love that. Duh. Get real.*

I don't need much, I just need more than I'm getting. I'm sure many of us have heard of the $75,000 Study, the one that shows that happiness and security increase up to about that point, but not really beyond. Well, legitimately, I think I could cut that in half and be *So Fucking Happy.* Literally. 

Sometimes I just think about it. What would life be like if $3000 just showed up in my bank account each month? How little stress and worry would I have about my monthly bills? How easy would it be to turn around and put some of that towards savings or investments? *A mere $3k.* 

Covid showed many of us what a form of UBI could look like, and I think many of us are having trouble recovering from it. I was one. I qualified for the PUA form of unemployment for the full year and a half. I think in the beginning it amounted to nearly a thousand dollars a week (or every two weeks?). That alone was in excess of anything I'd ever made before. Take away a lot of my expenses, because I was staying home more, and the money just accumulated. Those initial payments were cut down, but for a full year and a half I basically didn't worry about money at all.

Strangely enough, in many ways 2020 was one of the best years of my life. I fell in love and lived without worry. Yes, parts of the pandemic were scary and uncertain -- but in other ways came security. 

---

Truly, I don't know where I'm going with this.

I guess I'm just tired of a life of constantly feeling stretched thin, but with seemingly no alternative.

I could do what I'm already doing, and just force myself to work more. I'm already pretty sick of what I'm doing, though, and losing more hours to work I already don't like sounds like a losing proposition.

I could buckle down and embark on my first true ""job search"" in years. That could work out well. It could also end in finding a new job I don't like, for less hourly pay, and probably more of my hours per week. ""Everyone hates their job.""

I just wish there were *something else* -- a vision I have a fuzzy picture of, but no detail. A future that's just *better*, and doesn't involve some kind of transaction for our hearts and souls. 

I have this vision, but I can't help but think, *No, it's stupid.* No one is going to pay me a full-time salary for part time work. No one is going to give some previously ""gifted"" idiot without a degree more than the <$15/hr he's worth.

So it's like ... do I *deserve* to toil? Do I *deserve* to never get ahead? Do I *deserve* the situation I'm in? 

Because that's what it feels like -- and that's why it feels like I'm never going to get out.",7,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1k4lf1b/a_dream_of_parttime_work_for_fulltime_pay/,1745261690.0,naked_feet,1k4lf1b,advice_seeking
antiwork,career change at 30/40,My New Workplace Is Giving Me Chest Pains. Let Me Explain... (my apologies for the length),"I (35F) have been working as an Admissions Counselor (AC) for a private, not-for-profit university for about 3 months now. It took them a full, very long 30 days to call me back, so I was excited that I was awarded the job and could finally start. It's a 10min drive from my home, pays beautifully, has inexpensive but superb benefits, and looks wonderful on paper and sounds great in conversation. It really does. No denying that. I am actually proud when I tell people what I do. What I have to ask myself is: *What am I willing to put up with to continue receiving the salary and benefits?*

Not long after I started, they sent us on a business trip about an 1.5hrs away for 3 nights and 4 days where we learned from some of the Big Wigs, including the Founder. I was told by boss prior that I should be ON MY TOES AT ALL TIMES, as I am representing her and our particular campus. She basically threatened that there would be a report written up about each of us and how much or little we participated, our appearance, whether or not we were at least a half hour early, etc. I had to go out and get a nice blazer that fit me correctly just for this trip, with very little notice (we don't wear those in the office FYI). She scared the LIVING SHIT out of all of this over this trip—we were shaking in our boots, only to discover that it was NOT that serious. Yes, we should obviously take it seriously, but we were way too fucking nervous! When we all got back from the trip, the supposed ""reports"" were never mentioned again. 1st red flag confirmed.

I knew from the initial interview that we are expected to do 80-100 dials per day, and 1-2 hours of total talk time... ""smile and dial!"". It took me a few weeks to be able to work up to 80 dials. If we failed to do that, we were told that we needed to work on our Time Management and were questioned if we were really serious about our role.

The metrics and tabs on EVERYTHING about us is nothing short of insane. In addition to monitoring every text/call/email, internal chat message, calendar surveillance, etc... I know for a fact that they record how many keystrokes we make per hour, how often the mouse is moved, and more overkill data of that nature. Our calls are all recorded and some (who knows how many) are listened to for critique, and from what I've heard—some are played an entire meetings of coworkers to hear. My boss literally told us that on her 1hr15min drive home, she can listen to our calls on an app on her phone through her car's Bluetooth system... I could have lived just fine without knowing about this supposed and frankly really creepy threat. As if we weren't already scared shitless about perhaps breathing too loud.

Despite the Big Brother 24/7/365 surveillance, we are still required to manually put an emailed report together the for the Director of Admissions (DOA) & Assistant Director (AD) at the end of each shift. This includes tasks (current, overdue, future), potentials, interviews, contacts, appointments, and the table that includes all of our phone/text/email totals, in addition to a custom attached Excel spreadsheet. It's almost as if they couldn't look all this up for themselves! I send this report at the last minute of my shift because truthfully, I don't want to have to deal with any replies until the next day and simply don't have time.

Please also note we can get into hot water if we are in the building too late or too early, because then they have to pay our mandatory armed security OT. That was a HUGE thing BTW.

Almost every single morning, there is a lovely email from my boss sitting in my inbox just waiting for me to open. I can feel it as soon as out my Outlook loads:

* ""*Why were your dials so low?*""
* ""*What happened?*""
* ""*We need to talk.*""
* ""*You must comply immediately.*""
* ""*Come to my office first thing.*""
* ""*Our conversation raises concerns...*""
   * *Etc, etc, etc*

What did I do that was so bad? If I don't make the 80 dials, there IS a reason and no, it's not because I'm goofing off or on my phone. There's no time for that. Sometimes I have 2-3 student appointments that can take anywhere between 1-2 hours. I'm expected to take incoming calls that can be lengthy (some lasting 30 mins), and then needing to make notes and update statuses in the system, let the assigned counselor be aware of it, etc. I have to squeeze in the 80-100 dials. I have to reply to student emails, group chat text messages between the department, and try my best whenever I have a moment to help older workers learn the new punch in/punch out system which often malfunctions, and random due diligence things (ex: sending reminder text & emails manually for upcoming appointments). I have to, of course, take a 1hr unpaid lunch and believe me, it is fully necessary to at least try to recalibrate your brain in that slot. If you want to take a 15-min break, you must email a formal request to all 3 receptionists, and copy the DOA & AD. Sometimes the time I requested to take the break comes and goes, and is never acknowledged. We are legally entitled to 2 approved 15-min breaks but it's such a production, most coworkers only take 1 if they really need it. There's a sort of undertone of being ""*lazy*"" if you take 2 of those 15-min breaks. I don't know that for a fact... but you can feel it and the table they periodically send out tells everyone how many breaks you took and when...

If you have to use the bathroom, you must say ""RR"" (restroom) to the group chat so there is an explanation why your chat status is ""*Be right back*"" and you are absent at your desk. One poor guy got back from lunch and had to go the bathroom, said ""RR"" to the chat, and our boss called him out in front of the entire department chat saying, ""*Did you not just get back from lunch?*"" Lady. When you gotta go, YOU GOTTA GO. Sometimes, it just does not line up perfectly! Happened to me and I was terrified but luckily, it flew under the radar somehow. I've never been so stressed about the bathroom in my life and I have had many different jobs is plenty of industries.

SAME THING: If you're away from your desk at the Printer, you must also state the to the group chat so there is an explanation why your chat status is ""*Be right back*"" and you are absent at your desk. This feature also stops incoming calls to your computer. When you do return to your cubicle, you can get into deep shit if you don't immediately change your status back to *Available* (green) to be able to resume getting incoming calls. Even for someone as organized as me, I sometimes forget because there's so many status changes per shift and chaos happening within the office. There's too many moving parts at times, and that is just the nature of this higher education beast.

As I said, I've only been there for about 3 months. Within that time, 4 AC's have left. 1 person was there for a year, and the other 3 were there for about how long I was—2 quit, 2 were fired. I don't know all the details, but I could guess. From the very beginning,I also couldn't help but notice from the that there's \~35 different former AC names in our system over the past 2 years—people I have never, ever heard of. Yet another massive red flag. What happened to all of those people? Quit? Fired? Laid off? Leave of absence? 2-weeks notice? Walk-out? I will never know. Why is turnover so severe and what is being done to retain people besides ordering us free lunches? That's very nice, but it is not enough. The stress at one point was giving me literal chest pains, and I have a family history of cardiac problems.

We're really intended to have 4 receptionists. We only have 3, and one had her last day on Friday. Another one is putting in their 2-weeks notice (after they burn through their stashed PTO) because they've HAD IT with the place after 2 years. They're interviewing new people but how helpful could warm bodies in that have only just started? They're not going to know much for a while—it's not about them, there's just a steep learning curve and very strict demeanor to our working environments. And might I add that we need one receptionist MINIMUM at that Front Desk from 7:30am-8:30pm M-F, as well has 5hrs on Saturday. If you can't tell... the structure is surely imploding, people.

I have been required to work 6-day work weeks around the holidays. The OT is undeniably nice, but I prefer having a full 2 days off from work to reset because of how intense work can get sometimes. I'd rather have no OT and have more recovery time, but it is what it is.

The day after New Year's, I came in at 8am. Well, actually 7:45am because they REQUIRE that you are 15-mins early before you clock in to get coffee, go to the bathroom, whatever. By 9am, she rolled up on my desk and asked how many calls I had taken so far. THE PHONE HAD NOT RUNG YET. I told her this and she didn't believe me. Go check your metrics.

We got into a big thing because I was focusing less on my 80 dials and more about answering incoming calls. ""*Why are you not hitting 80?*"" So I focused on the 80+ and skipped incoming calls and let other people answer them so I could meet my quota. Then it became, ""*Why are you ignoring incoming calls?*"" Sometimes, it is simply not POSSIBLE to do both among all the other unmentioned tasks that are assigned daily to everyone. During this ultra serious and important meeting, she said, ""*You seem nervous. Why?*"" Uh, yeah, I'm wondering if you're about to fire me on the spot and I'm mentally preparing for the blow in front of the AD.

This university has quickly become what people on Glassdoor are calling a ""*diploma mill*"". Here are some of the reviews that have been said by ACs of 20+ campuses:

* ""*Management will obscure the truth, if not flat out lie to you. Admissions, albeit a well-oiled machine, acts a predatory call center. Expect to make upwards of 100 calls on a day without appointments. The leads are lukewarm at best, often resulting in conversations with people who had no intention of enrolling. However, you are expected to convince a prospect to come to campus for an extended interview. You will be told your goal is to ""make a shared decision"" with a proapective student after subjecting them to what often becomes an hour long information gathering session. If a prospect is remotely qualified, you will be instructed to enroll them on the spot or push an unrealistic timeframe to complete enrollment. Expect to be micromanaged at every turn. Whether while actively on a call during an interview, and after an unsuccessful interview. The latter often stemming from not pressuring an unsure prospect into a generalist program, citing that ""they can change majors after they figure out their end goal."" Don't be mistaken, this is a sales position masquerading as admissions. Campus tours are optional, prospects are pressured into hasty decisions costing almost $20,000 immediately, and you will be expected to hit quotas. Meeting and exceeding quotas has zero incentive outside of a sheet of paper effevtively saying ""good job!' Falling short of quotas results in increased micromanaging. Doing so repeatedly will see you put into ethically comprimising situations. The company as a whole touts itself as non-profit, focusing on in demand career education. This could not be further from the truth. For those recent graduates who do not apply for this role, but find that a manager has reached out to you directly to offer an interview, take this review into consideration. Do not take this position in haste for the sake of convenience. Do not give up on yourself or the aspirations that drove you to complete your degree. There is something better out there for you.*""
   * **Advice to Management:** ""*Treat your employees like people, not cogs in the machine. I don't mean more potlucks, pizza in the office, or candy bowls in the directors office. Give counselors a reason to want to come to work outside of the shallow emotional appeals. Ultimately, be honest with the counselors and encourage them to do so as well.*""
* ""*All they care about is their enrollment numbers. It doesn't matter how many students actually graduate or how many end up in crippling debt.*""
* ""*Terrible management, They only care about the money, not the student, filed as a non profit, but operates as a for profit school, XXXXX are both on the board of for profit colleges. Why if they are a non profit? they are over priced and ruin students life.*""
* ""*They will fire you without cause or notice. During Covid they furloughed a bunch of people (which should have shown them how they are) for nearly a year. Just a few months ago they let go I'd say tens to hundreds of loyal long term professors and others at every branch right before the holidays. RUTHLESS. They do not pay well. They cut some of the salaries of the employees they retained from 40 hour a week employees to 30 hours taking away 1/4 of their salaries. This is a toxic work environment. In many ways this is a diploma mill. A lot of the students that make it through various programs remain uneducated and are unhirable. All this University cares about is money, Oh, and the not for profit status is a joke. This ""University"" is very much a for profit institution at its core. No one but the newly hired (less than 6th months) are happy here because they don't know better. This place hemorrhages employees. It's awful. Take my advice and DO NOT come to work here. You will absolutely regret it. And for god's sake, DO NOT MOVE from somewhere else to work here! This is an unsecure employment option. If you get hired on here you will regret it!*""
* ""*This is essentially a call center that demands a college degree Please do not do this to yourself*""
   * **Advice to Management:** ""*Stop micromanaging.*""
* ""*No work/life balance, I witnessed an employee who had been working there for 14 years get told he couldn’t take a week off for his earned vacation time. And it wasn’t even during the last enrollment week or during the 3 month blackout period they have. The inconsistent schedule is not sustainable for anyone craving a consistent schedule in their life. The pressure to push people who don’t want to go to an expensive private school feels immoral at times. You get blamed for students who simply don’t want to be six figures in student loan debt.*""
   * **Advice to Management:** ""*Stop making it seem like a call center and stop treating humans like nothing but money bags, your acceptance rate is publicly high to put on a 'hard to get' act. It should present as a respectable institution and not a cheap scam.*""
* ""*Look at students as numbers and dollars, not people. Thankless job. No room for growth. Micromanagement is excessive!*""
* ""*They lie about the position and what it entails. The position is more sales than anything. Very high metrics that are not sustainable. Preys on the black and brown community. Constant write ups if you don’t make over 200 calls a day. They recently were also sued and that loss details can be found publicly.*""
* ""N*o work/life balance Student's first at the expense of employees mental health Rolling admissions is inhumane (over 12 start dates/year) One of the WORST jobs I've ever had.*""
   * **Advice to Management:** ""*Just because the schedule for admissions worked in the past, does not mean that it's working now. If you want to keep people employed, give them a work life balance. No more rolling admissions.*""
* ""*Micromanaging. Telemarketing. It is a sales job. Monthly numbers/goals. Lot of pressure to reach goals. Goals are usually unrealistic.*""
   * **Advice to Management:** ""*Stop focusing on making money / looking at every new student as a walking dollar sign. Focus on the needs of your employees and promote a healthy work/life balance.*
* ""*micro management. Couldn't go a more than a hour or two without having to check in.*""
* ""*This is a sales position not 'admissions'. You are expected to hit sales quotas. If you have a college degree you will feel bad for signing ppl up for an unethical school.

You will be required to make 80-100 calls every day from inquiries that can be over 5 years old. You'll have a certain number of enrollments you'll need to reach per month. You will be questioned why students you met with did not enroll and why they want to visit other schools. The management is completely out of touch & have no leadership skills. They often treat you as if you're a child, speaking to you in condescending tones and exploding if you ask a question that they think you should already know the answer to. There are many unwritten rules and policies that are not listed in any handbook. You receive five PTO days for your first year (this includes both sick and personal time) and you have a 3 month ""blackout period"" during the summer. You are required to work long hours (10 or 11 hour days are required) and often several Saturdays a month.

The official phrase is ""policy vs practice."" The deans don't like to deal with students. Students are constantly dropping out and admissions make bets on how long they will last when they enroll them.

Very little raises, if any. Unrealistic goals for the student demographic and cost of tuition. Marginal benefits. Follow through is marginal. Very little coaching and developing for some people, and plenty for others. Inconsistent.*""
* ""*Management is terrible and when admissions is doing badly they just blame the counselors and write you up to scare you. They do not respect your personal time, expect you to work over time and never take a day off. You have to work two saturdays a month and stay late on orientation. Students are looked at as numbers and not really as ""making a difference."" All business oriented. The higher ups do not value admissions counselors. You have to make 100 calls a day or you will be scolded. You follow an interview script that is 100 years old when interviewing students. If you are a minute late you are scolded (but they expect you to stay late).*""
* ""*Culture of extreme manipulation from management. Extreme hypocrisy; being an admissions counselor for a for-profit (regardless of what is said, it IS for profit) university is a SALES JOB plain and simple. Treat it like a sales job and people will know what to expect. They hire educated people and treat them like stupid children.*""

You surely get the point by now. There are far more stories, details, and conversations but this should sum it up pretty well. My apologies for the length of the post—I have been internalizing this for far too long, as you can see!

I am trapped and I wanted to tell people about it that are outside of this unfortunate situation. Personally, it's very difficult for me to wrap my head around a bad situation when I am planted in it. It's much easier for me to listen to someone else's predicament and come up with clear advice to help them.

I'd love to know your thoughts, advice, commentary. I feel crazy, stupid, useless, and a failure most of my waking life. Thank you in advance, my dear r/antiwork tribe. Happy Sunday to you + yours.

Ya guessed it, manager scheduled her and pulled 'you won't always get the days you asked for.' then moved on to 'we won't have anyone to cover' lines.

Her other sibling is driving four hours to pick her up and then another six hours to home.

antiwork,go back to school,My manager had a tantrum earlier today & denied my Time off for my 21st birthday. And he’s taking the same week off for PTO.,"Added context:
My “team” and I are young. 20-23 years old. All of us go to college besides one who works another job.  Ever since classes started in early August, I’ve been working closing shifts on the weekdays and regular shifts on weekends. I have the best availability besides the manager currently. So everyone besides the manager work part time. It’s a retail, commission-based, job. As well, everyone works solo shifts besides on weekends. This isn’t our store’s fault but it’s just how the company sets it up.


Now my manager primarily works opening shifts. He originally didn’t have an issue with this and actually looked forward to working those type of shifts when school was starting back up. Anyways now, it seems to be taking a bit of a toll on him. So, he’s been having interviews with several people in hopes of hiring an opener. Luckily, a few have that type of availability. 

Important as well, me and my manager don’t necessarily get along. We’ve argued through text & in person & don’t necessarily see eye to eye. He also tends to put himself over us, his employees, a lot. He can be an asshole sometimes and has pushed several employees to quit. Like he’s VERY petty. He’s also very forgetful and leaves us to deal with the problems he creates (i.e. scheduling you on a week that you requested off despite him initially confirming it to as fine. He actually did this to an employee who told him weeks in advance that he was going to Hawaii. Manager tried to force him to work). You basically get the feeling that you need to absolutely have this job as first priority. But I like working here because it works perfectly with my classes & I just love the job in general.

Now as to why he’s texting like this:
So I was working my mid day 4 hour shift. I planned to get to my goddaughter’s birthday then immediately head home to work on my school projects. Anyways when I clocked in, my manager tells me that I’ll be working on the floor and selling while he does interviews. I should basically pretend he’s not here. Fine with me. Hours later and my clock out time rolls around the corner so I’m ready to clock out. His interview process was done hours ago. He immediately stops me and tells me “You can’t clock out until the person taking over the rest of the shift comes in.” Fair. But then I think about it and reply back, saying, “But aren’t you here?”(his clock out time is 2 hours after mine) He responds, “Yes, but remember I’m not here.” So then I’m thinking in my head, but didn’t you tell me that your interviews are done for today? Are you still not available even though you’ve been helping with sales? But it’s whatever, I’ll stay a bit to wait for my coworker. 

About 15 minutes pass by and he informs me that the same employee didn’t know they were working today. This employee works another job so I assume they were still at their other job. So he asks me if I can stay an extra 2 hours and then the other employee will come in. I, hesitant, say no because I have plans and I’ve allotted time to take care of these things. He immediately retorts, “Well I’m not about to work another 10 hour shift.” Things are kinda tense now. He goes into the backroom to start making calls to my coworkers in hopes that someone will cover. I’m there, at the register, just thinking about what to do. I ultimately decide I’ll stay 30 min past my clock out time and clock out. Nothing after that. Around 27 minutes after my supposed clock out time, he comes out, saying, “I guess you can clock out if you want to. You have a life. I don’t obviously” in a sarcastic tone. Laughs it off as well. I’m thinking well that works for me. But I don’t get why he’s so upset with me when it’s basically that other employee’s fault. It’s up to everyone to keep track of their shifts. It feels almost like he’s taking his frustrations out on me. But let me get out of here. I get my stuff and head out, and I don’t even say bye cuz I’m a bit upset about the whole thing.

Fast forward to the party. He starts texting like crazy in the group chat saying these things in the images above. He denies my time off request for my birthday. My 21st birthday. Keep in mind that Time off Requests weren’t necessarily requests. If you put it in at least 2 weeks prior, 99.9% of the time it’s getting approved. So while I’m at this party, I’m thinking, WTF it definitely feels like you’re targeting me. Especially since he denied my request as soon as I left as well. On top of that, he denied another employee’s request and then he didn’t even schedule them on the day that same day. So was their request really denied? I bite my tongue though because I know he’s looking for a reaction. Craziest part about it is he’s going to be gone for a week despite complaining about availability issues. Note that these aren’t emergency related. He usually takes PTO to visit friends/family. He leaves us to take care of the store.

So I’m stuck in between a rock and a hard place at the moment. This is Arizona if it matters. I’m thinking about calling the regional manager to help me out. I don’t know what to do and I definitely don’t want to spend my 21st at work. Even when I get off on October 4th (my birthday) I have to wake up relatively early the next day to get ready then head to work. I’m not sure I want to quit because of how balanced this job is at this location specifically. But I’ve started to look at Indeed anyway because I’ve had to put up with a lot of similar situations like this with him. I can’t necessarily remember all the instances of him acting like this or putting me in difficult situations but he’s denied days off when I was sick & tried to hint at denying a trip I told him about months before which he approved.

antiwork,go back to school,"Head of HR, North America - I'm So Done","I fell into this shit and I hate it. I don't like capitalism and I don't like corporations. I made some choices when I was younger that led me to degrees that led me to where I am. But, I've hit my limit and am going back to school for a BSN and MSN to be a psychiatric nurse practitioner and actually help people. I am a corporate saboteur - people have gotten good severances, people have been reminded of their rights for FMLA prior to a termination, missed work days have been not seen, and people have actually been taken care of to the extent I am able. But it's like helping people with two arms tied behind your back and a gun to your head, while juggling grenades with your feet - it's not sustainable and I'm either going to lose my mind or just get fired.

Yesterday an employee who barely survived cancer treatment and needs reconstructive surgery called me crying and in crisis. She was begging me to keep her job, to not be forced to go on leave (60%salary) and that she would come back to work on a certain date. It struck me that she was actively choosing to sacrifice her own wellbeing to work and take care of her family. I could her hear one of her kids saying ""mommy why are you crying?"" I calmed her down - I used to do therapy - and then told my CEO that we needed to give her additional time off until she recovered from the reconstructive surgery and if that wasn't the route they wanted to go they could tell her because I'm not having a death on my conscience.

Fuck that shit. I hate it so much. How the fuck do we accept doing this to one another. Fuck the billionaires. Fuck the corporations. And fuck the corrupt politicians that enable this all.

I'm venting but as this is antiwork I am hoping this sparks a bit of a discussion around how absolutely insane it in that in America we work to get health insurance and then die to keep it...

antiwork,go back to school,Company asked us to do paid charity work then changed it to unpaid at the last minute.,"It went over like a lead balloon. 

So my job wanted to do some local charity work, which is obviously a PR stunt, while wearing company gear and having someone take photos. The initial idea was we'd work at the charity area for 4 hours then go back to the office for the other half of the day but we'd be paid like it was a full day. On top of that, we'd get a free lunch that wasn't pizza. For a bunch of office workers who don't get much sunlight, this seemed like a good deal. 

A couple of days before the event, they changed it to Saturday. They said it was for 'logistic' reasons and it would allow more people to volunteer (there was also a rumor they didn't run this by corporate). Since it's on a Saturday, it wouldn't be paid. And for lunch, they'd get us pizza to make it easier on everyone so we wouldn't have to drive to another location. 

Needless to say, over 90% of those who volunteered crossed their names off the signup sheet the Friday before and the event was cancelled due to lack of people. We got an email from the branch manager the following Monday about how disappointed he was in us and how we let down the organization we were working with. And how he practices what he preaches and donates so much of his personal money to charities (he donates to the private school he and his kids attended). I don't really see how donating to a bunch of rich kids is a charity but you do you. 

I'm still laughing about it. It's pretty stupid to think people would fall for such a huge bait and switch. ",6084,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1f6e6jv/company_asked_us_to_do_paid_charity_work_then/,1725196524.0,Away_Location,1f6e6jv,advice_seeking
antiwork,go back to school,I got fired 3 days ago in a Reduction in Force after almost 9 years with a company. At almost 52 years old I am screwed ,"I dropped out of school because we had kids soon after we got married. Graduated highschool in 91.  I was self taught in fixing hardware and software. Then I learned HTML and CSS and designed websites in late 90s.

I finally went back to school in 2014 and in 2018 in got my BS in Information Technology - Software. At the time I was working full time writing, maintaining, and optimizing SQL reports.

I wasn't making much money at the time, but I did then move into a C# developer position at the same company.  

I decided to go back to school again but was living off my income and student loans. I got a 2nd job working graveyard at a convenient store, Friday to Sunday. I was also a full time student getting a Masters Degree in Computer Science - Software Engineering. 

I would get off work from the convenience store at 6 AM Monday and drove straight to my other job, changed clothes in a bathroom stall and worked another 8 hours. 

I would get my work done fast at the convenience store and sit on the counter with my laptop writing research papers, that sometimes were 35 - 50 pages long. 

Finished my Masters February of 2020. Got a raise at work and was made  Software Engineer I. I quit my 2nd job about 2 weeks before COVID hit big. I was given a laptop and was work from home since then. 

3 days ago my company let go 10% of the department and I was one that lost their job. 

I had a serious accident in 2008 that I broke my neck. From 2012 to 2016 I was on SSI with permanent disability.  I lost our home in 2008 in the market crash and lost my job then as an IT Manager.

Had to file bankruptcy in 2017.

15 days before I lost my job, my wife lost her part time work from home job.  

My oldest is getting divorced and is moving in this weekend to help with rent and utilities. Our 4 youngest are also adults and live at home and pay some rent because they can't afford to move out. 

Now I have no job, no credit, almost $100, 000 in student loans. Medical bills like crazy because of my chronic pain. I had a neck fusion in 2012. 

I spent the last couple days filing for unemployment, food stamps, and state medical. I contacted a lawyer to get back in SSI.  I am applying for jobs everywhere including part time at grocery stores, just to get some income. 

I worked so hard and pushed through so much pain at work to get where I was and now I have nothing to show for it. 

I am almost 52, I had worked almost 9 years at my last job and had planned to retire from there and now I feel so lost and tired and sad and pissed off.",1607,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1i3b3ej/i_got_fired_3_days_ago_in_a_reduction_in_force/,1737098800.0,Alarmed-Pollution-89,1i3b3ej,advice_seeking
antiwork,is a master's degree worth it,I’ll never be successful because I refuse to be exploited,"I think I’m someone who burned out before I even got out of college considering I had to work two jobs just to get my degree. My parents refused to help me financially even though they had the means to, and also wouldn’t co-sign on my loans but that’s a different story. Anyway, while I was in school I worked a serving and a bartending job and ironically was making more money than I would be offered after getting a business degree. Going to school and working two jobs was definitely taxing. So by the time I was out of school, I was ready to go down to one job and hope that one job was going to be more than enough to pay my bills, and provide a little extra comfort. 

 After graduation, it seemed a little difficult to break into the field of work that I wanted to. Once I finally started getting interviews maybe 2 to 3 months after graduation I realized that pretty much every company was trying to lowball me. For example, my mother is Japanese and I happen to speak Japanese fluently and I have a degree in international business. I thought that this skill set would make me very valuable in the job market. I received a job offer from a company who told me being able to speak Japanese was what attracted them to me and that’s why I specifically was offered the position. However, I was offered $24 an hour to work 8 to 9 hour shifts five days a week. During this time I was still working as a server and making roughly $30-$40 an hour with tips in 5 to 6 hour shifts. I told the recruiting manager this and they rebottled with well… The best we can offer you is 26 an hour. I am also bipolar so for some reason working longer shifts really doesn’t do my mental health any favors and I am way more likely to burn out. It just didn’t make sense to me to accept a position where I work more hours for less money. However, other people in my life, including my mother, and my ex partner, told me I was stupid for not jumping at the opportunity. 

 I definitely understand where they are coming from but I am used to making 30 to 40 an hour and my lifestyle has adjusted to that. I would be taking a huge pay cut for more work and longer hours. I was told oh just rough it out for six months and then maybe after that if you do a good job, they’re going to promote you. Yeah so I’m just supposed to basically accept less money, do more work and hope that I get a promotion if I perform well? No thank you. I don’t wanna be stuck serving forever, but I’m tired of these companies lowballing me. That company was just one example there’s been many others. I don’t know if I have an attitude problem, but I feel like because I suffered what I suffered to get my degree and paid for it out of my own pocket which was expensive. I deserve to be compensated more and I’m not going to accept anything less from these companies. In fact, it bothers me that other people that graduated with me got jobs making $21-$24 an hour. 

 Why are we all accepting this when the cost of living is as high as it is? And we’re educated. We still have to pay back those expensive student loans. So what was the point of going through college to get a degree in the first place when that piece of paper was expensive and doesn’t even guarantee you a high wage because these companies wanna play games? But apparently we’re supposed to go along with their games for six months while we’re probably financially ruined and then maybe just maybe they might promote you and raise your pay. But in reality, we know how these companies are. They’re probably going to fire you and then hire a new grad to take your position and pay them even less than they were paying you. I’m sick of it all and we all deserve so much better. I guess a bachelor’s is the equivalent of a high school degree nowadays, yet it costs $50,000-$90,000. What a joke. 


Edit: to all the people saying that I am entitled for suggesting that companies are lowballing me, you are missing the point entirely. My point is that pretty much everybody is underpaid in society and I think it’s absolutely ridiculous that a company would offer to pay you peanuts after you pay for something as ridiculously expensive as a bachelors degree. Furthermore to those of you saying servers are over paid or don’t deserve to make what we make, let me clue you in. I work with a lot of teachers, people who have masters degrees obviously. And all of them tell me that they make more money waiting tables than they do teaching. But everyone is somehow wondering why no one wants to teach anymore. My point is society is broken and everybody is underpaid, especially people that are educated. But for some reason, bootlickers exist and they believe that we’re just supposed to play along and play this game of being paid low wages. You have to kiss corporate ass and climb up a ladder because it’s so worth it in the end.

Just stuff I'm assigned and then told to kind of not go over the top on...) I'm probably just not expressing things right, or maybe feeling too strongly when expressing. Who knows. I feel alienated at times because of my stance on my work though...

I don't even care about recognition or raises. I've gotten some recognition for things, and even a small raise, but I didn't feel anything over it. 

I just want to know in my heart that I'm making interesting writing choices I can enjoy, make some sort of spark with what I passionately studied- making *something*  for myself... but more often in the everyday I'm being considered on how I lay out information in excel sheets and how often I make notes on things as opposed to the actual creative process.

Things are outsourced and I have to edit those outsources and I'm told here and there to stop being so ""strict"" with shitty writing too.  Part of it feels childish, like mapping things out and having formulas for everything so outsourcing work can go smoother is the ""more productive"" thing, but I feel so empty over it. It bleeds into that time I get for my personal art too, and I feel lacking there too. Hopefully I'll put together a small solo show this year, friends have been egging me on at least. 

Sometimes I feel like I'm not doing what I was brought on to do, but just brought on to look like I'm doing what I'm meant to do, and then even what I'm meant to do feels foggy. I know what I can do to make things meaningful in the writing, but I feel myself slipping away from that many a time- just say fuck it and send off a chapter of something after running through it just once cause it's not like my job is interested in my creative passion anyway. 

My incredibly supportive partner is always telling me ""people read what you work on, and write kind reviews and stuff, that's a good sign!"" And whatnot, but I don't feel much from that either. I don't get praises at work from that either.

I brought it up the last time I was recognized and prsised for something by my boss, the number of pages I work on per month- numbers. I honestly don't care how many pages I've gone through this month or the numbers. all I'm concerned with is if someone is gonna read a chapter of something I did and be convinced it was worth there 2 dollars for 30-40 pages of something. I told my boss just that. He's a nice guy and is very open about things. Our whole team is and I felt comfortable saying it. My boss vibed with it but ultimately felt kinda just like a weird silence between our conversation. Like he got me but it wasn't quite resonant of the feeling- of my lack of interest in -more-. 

I feel like maybe I'm being too perfectionist about life, denying myself some things while seeking out others that are unattainable, and then sometimes I feel like the idea of working just sucks and has been numbing me to no end. I'm probably in no position to complain since I have a loving home, can work from home, can survive and put money aside and all that, and work with nice people but idk
Can anyone relate to this as an individual artist/practicioner or in general?

antiwork,is a master's degree worth it,Should I feel bad about leaving my childcare job after 1 day? I’m having severe anxiety about it.,"Background: I was a teacher at a private school and had premature twins in March. I had no means of childcare (it would’ve cost more to put them in daycare/gas money to my job than I got in a paycheck), so I didn’t go back to work.

My husband’s work has a daycare/preschool program connected to it. I was told I could bring my twins there for a big discount and work there as a preschool teacher. Anyways, I had my first day today and it wasn’t really what I thought it was going to be like. I don’t think it’s a good fit for me, and I am just two courses away from my masters degree.

The director made a comment today about how my twins were definitely going to get sick and that all the infants in the infant room last week had the flu. The cleaning procedures put in place are questionable. There are kids there until 6pm and the last person working is there until 6pm…. I don’t think they are staying there unpaid to clean. I hadn’t really thought about them getting sicknesses before, just like common cold stuff, but I just read that the likelihood is extremely high they will get rsv in daycare. They don’t have their rsv vaccine, and it’s not available for them right now. Both of my twins were apneic at birth and needed resuscitation,  and one of my twins needed respiratory support and CPAP in their first days of life. It was so terrifying and traumatizing to me, and thinking of them getting RSV and having to go through respiratory issues again is making me sick in my stomach.

We don’t need the extra income from me, we have went these first six months of their life with just his income, I just figured I would work there to be social and get out of the house. Now I’m really regretting getting this position, but I feel horrible leaving them high and dry especially because another worker there just didn’t show up today. (No call, no show).

What should I do, quit? & if so, how should I do it?

**Hey r/antiwork, I just want to preface something before jumping into my post,**

I used to think this sub was just for people who quit their jobs. I was extremely wrong. Lately I’ve been struggling with a loss of purpose and didn’t know where to ask for advice. Then I saw the part in the subs description saying **“getting the most out of a work-free life”** and thought maybe this is the place to ask.

I didn’t choose a work-free life, but now that I have one, I’m trying to figure out how to really live. If this doesn’t belong here, I apologize.

***

Now, with that out of the way, a bit about me, I’m 23, and I served in the US Navy from 2020 to 2025. In 2023 I experienced a lifelong injury in a boating accident that has hindered me from basic physical activities, causing me to be 100% disabled with no ability to sustain gainful employment.

I was officially medically retired in April 2025.

In the past three and a half months, I’ve had more time and money than I’ve ever had in my life. So, I said fuck it, I’ll just leave the US. I never cared much for the country anyway. I enlisted for a degree and a roof over my head, not for patriotism. I’ve always disagreed with U.S. policies, hated every political party and talking point, and felt crushed by capitalism, interest, and overpriced everything just to have a chance at a life. Just everything. So I left with a one-way ticket to a country I fell in love with that I served in while in the Navy. Best decision i’ve ever made in my 23 years.

For a little bit, I felt like I was really living. New country, free from any responsibility’s, living life! But now that the high of uprooting my life is gone, I have no idea how to structure my days or feel any kind of purpose.

I’m so genuinely terrified that if I keep scrolling TikTok until I sleep, I’ll blink and be 50, looking back at a useless life wasted. Where my only memory would be of a washed up kid who broke his back for Americas war fighting business, just a forgotten shell of a human who did nothing. Again, I’m so fucking terrified of growing old with nothing to remember, nothing to love, nothing to hate, just nothing. I need to live and I fucking want to live.

I think I’m young. I feel as if I still have so much ahead of me, but I don’t know where to start. I am just really hoping someone here somehow has a rule book or guide on how to live a work free life, while still having a full and meaningful life in the end. Please, help. Any advice would be so much for me.

*tl;dr*  
I’m 23, medically retired from the US Navy after a disabling injury. I now receive lifetime income and recently moved abroad. At first, life felt free and exciting, but now I’m struggling with boredom, lack of structure, and a growing fear of wasting my life. I need help figuring out how to build purpose and meaning work-free.

antiwork,quit job to start business,"My Boss Flipped Out After I Quit, and Now He’s Threatening ""Consequences""","[*ORIGNAL POST* ](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1fjx11t/carrying_my_bosss_company_yet_somehow_im_the_one/?rdt=34729)*-* ***BLUF****: Joined a small tech R&D firm where the boss was an academic with no real business experience. He tried running the company based on books he read, not real-world knowledge. After laying off half the company, most people quit, leaving just me and the program manager. I’ve been running the whole technical side, but he still micromanages and critiques everything while contributing nothing. Now I'm looking for an exit.*

**UPDATE**

So after grinding through endless micromanagement and carrying my entire department on my back, I finally accepted a new job offer. I sent my boss an email letting him know I’d be resigning, offering two options: I could finish my high-priority writing project (the one he kept emphasizing) and leave by mid-month, or I could stay until the end of the month to wrap up everything, including the technical project and all the admin/business stuff I’d been handling solo.

My new job was starting on the 28th, so for the past week, I’ve been working *both* jobs: my new one 9-5 and the old one from 5 p.m. until midnight (or later). I documented everything down to the smallest detail, so he’d have all he needed. I didn’t feel like I needed to spell this schedule out to him since the company always operated on flexible hours.

He replied saying he was disappointed but understood, so I thought we were good. But then he called and let me know just how ""disappointed"" he was. Apparently, I was supposed to ""seek his blessing"" before leaving. The irony? When he hired me, he didn’t even want to give me two weeks to leave my last role—he expected me to start the Monday after sending the offer on a Thursday.

From the day I submitted my resignation up until my last day, my boss was mostly AWOL. I kept sending him detailed update emails, asking if he needed anything else, checking in to make sure he’d be set for the transition. But he was nowhere to be found. You’d think he’d be the most engaged at this point—this is his company, and I’m literally the last technical employee left, apart from the program manager, who he actually instructed me *not* to inform of my departure until the day before I left. I practically had to chase him down to ensure he was getting everything he needed. For someone who’s repeatedly insisted on “control” and micromanaged endlessly, he was oddly disengaged and unresponsive during the only time it really mattered.

So, he schedules a handoff meeting for Thursday at 2 p.m., but I already have meetings for my new job. I suggest 4 p.m., and he gets upset, questioning why I’m still working if I’ve already quit. I clarify that I’m splitting my time for a smooth transition, and he absolutely *loses it.* I explain it was either this arrangement or leaving him high and dry, but he’s still furious.

Finally, at 4 p.m., he shows up for the meeting—his first involvement in any of the transition. He asks for a full walkthrough of everything. I had already put it all in writing, with flawless documentation, reports, and tutorials, but I run through it anyway. Four hours, no breaks. Every single question answered, everything demonstrated.

When we wrap up, he goes, “We might still need some guidance on things.” I start to say, “For what it’s worth, I never meant to—” but he cuts me off, saying he’s “seeking counsel” on how to deal with this situation. Claims nobody’s ever “done this to him before,” then vaguely threatens to “figure out what he needs to report” before storming off.

Not sure what “counsel” he’s getting, but I’m hoping this is just an empty threat.

I’m beyond frustrated. Despite everything, I really tried to leave on good terms. I busted my butt to get every last detail done, even working long hours after quitting to make sure everything was flawless for him. I kept things professional, communicated often, and documented every project and process. I was ready to put this behind me and tried to reach out for a genuine conversation at the end, maybe even find a bit of closure. But instead, he had to make things difficult, ignoring all my efforts until the last second, then dragging me through a grueling four-hour session. When I tried to wrap it up amicably, he shut me down with a vague threat and stormed off. He made a tough ending even worse, and it’s a huge relief to finally be done with it.

UPDATE - 11/10/24

Small update to this: 
The following morning, my ex boss emails me with the standard exit paperwork. In this, he included his version of the timeline of events since I resigned, an excerpt from some of the onboarding paperwork where I agreed not to ""disparage the company, work for a ""competing"" company, etc. He also said that I ""committed"" to provide ongoing support as needed for the next 12 months. Finally, he wanted all the home office stuff that I got when I started working, (mismatched chair, desk, headphones, etc) back. 

I sent back a very direct and pointed email with my version of events, everything I did for him, and very firmly stated that I did not commit and will not support anything else. Haven't heard back from this. 

While I was coordinating dropping my home office stuff off with the PM, she offered (and coordinated with the boss) for me to just buy my equipment back for $500 (actual value is close to $1500). So I got to keep my stuff and my set up for a good price. 
Mailed the check, sent an email confirming the agreement. And I am done. Done. Done.

In response to the people who say I was ""simping"" too hard or shouldn't have worked so much - 
A) I own and take pride in my work. If I'm leaving, I'm not giving anyone an option to say the company failed because of me or something I did. Or worse, for my ex-boss to go to my new employer and throw me under the bus. 
B) Ethically, I have a responsibility to do the work I'm paid to do. I was still being paid, I had to do the work. 
C) There was a lot of weird paperwork I had to sign when I joined the company. I did more than I might have needed to just to cover my bases.",3970,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ggxvrt/my_boss_flipped_out_after_i_quit_and_now_hes/,1730436680.0,samster4225,1ggxvrt,advice_seeking
antiwork,quit job to start business,Boss is upset that I have a second job,"So I've been working at this company for about 8 months now as a marketing coordinator. The pay is decent but not amazing, so I picked up a part-time gig doing freelance graphic design on weekends and some evenings. Nothing crazy, maybe 10-15 hours a week max.

My boss found out last week when a coworker mentioned seeing my design work on Instagram. Now he's acting like I betrayed the company or something. He called me into his office last friday and basically said he's ""concerned about my commitment"" and that having a second job ""sends the wrong message about priorities.""

The thing is, I've never missed work, never been late, and my performance reviews have been solid. I do my freelance stuff entirely on my own time and it's not even in the same industry - we do B2B marketing and my side work is mostly small business logos and social media graphics.

He didn't outright tell me to quit the second job, but he made it pretty clear he's not happy about it. He also mentioned something about ""reviewing my workload"" which honestly sounds like a threat.

I checked my employment contract and there's nothing about not being allowed to have other work. The employee handbook has some vague language about ""conflicts of interest"" but my freelance clients aren't competitors or anything.

I'm kind of torn because I actually like this job and the team, but I also need the extra income. The freelance work helps me pay down student loans faster and I'm saving up for a house down payment. Plus I genuinely enjoy the creative work.

Has anyone else dealt with this? Am I being unreasonable for wanting to keep both jobs? I feel like as long as I'm doing good work and not violating any actual policies, what I do in my free time shouldn't matter.

No matter what, my superior and her lacchè are constantly abusive, demeaning and never losing a chance to rain on me all their frustrations, worst duties and true mobbing practices*.

I did a little bit of digging and found a facebook post of a former employee saying they weren’t sure why they were fired and that management and the owner are toxic.

obviously, part of me is worried that I won’t be treated well and I won’t be able to make ends meet like I thought. the other part of me who desperately needs this job says to just go to work, do my craft and keep my head down.

The Xbox and gym memberships are for my son. I can't afford to do a whole lot extra for him, so those are non-negotiable.

Moving is not an option. We're in a 2 bedroom apartment and are lucky enough to be within walking distance from his school, 2 grocery stores and the gym. I don't have a car right now so I take the bus to work.

I'm working on quitting smoking. I know that's the biggest expense I can cut 100%, and I honestly hate the fact that I was able to get sober but can't quit smoking.

I'm working on cutting out the coffee/energy drinks as well. A few months ago, the amount spent on those would have been WAY higher. And I only buy the cheapest store brand coffee and energy drinks from Dollar Tree. I don't even drink them for the taste. Working 16 hours straight, sometimes I just need the caffeine lol.

I have around $25k of debt from hospital bills, credit cards, and a vehicle I had repo-ed.

My credit score is in the low 500's, so I don't qualify for any regular credit cards, but I just signed up for a secured credit card (only $200, but it's a start). That card will ONLY be used to pay my phone/Internet bill every month.

My phone/Internet is the lowest price I could find. That price is for 2 lines, home internet, and Amazon Prime is included.

I haven't started a Roth IRA yet, but it's on my to-do list.

My questions: 

In general, is there anything it seems like I'm doing wrong?

I have pretty much $0 for emergencies right now. Should I just be putting everything extra in savings for now, or what kinds of accounts should I look at starting?

What's the best way to start whittling down my debt? Just start paying each individually? Contact one of those debt consolidation companies (if that's the case, any recommendations?)

Any info is greatly appreciated. All good info will also be passed on to my son. No way am I going to let him go into life financially blind like I did. He's almost 15 and already looking forward to his first job lol.

To describe my current situation, im 21M living with my partner and roommate in a $1500/month house. Over the past year, ive gone from having $3000+ in the bank to having roughly $2.7k credit (96% of my limit) on a discover card with 17.24% interest and $4.4k on a credit union credit card at 19.3% interest. The good news with the credit union is that $2.1k of it has no interest until September due to a promotion (not good news, but just trying to make the best of things). Additionally, my student loan repayments start next month, which I should have covered due to a surplus of a scholarship through at least the end of 2025. Lastly, my partner and I share a car I just took into the shop today to find that the transmission is well on its way out, with metal fragments glittering the transmission fluid (4k quote to replace) and various other ailments that make it pretty much non-sensical to sink more money into. My credit score stands around 670-690ish as of right now. My partner holds no debt. 

I work a job around 30ish hours a week that pays $16 an hour and once a month i travel to my home town (130 miles away by car) to work 2 shifts at a local bike shop that pays me $20 an hour. I've tried pici8nh up gigs here and there, but I realize that I am losing/have lost control on my finainces. My partner works 30-40 hours a week at $14.40 an hour.

I'm saving about 16% of my income between 401k, Roth, emergency fund contribution and restricted company stock purchase.

Notes:  
\- My car has expired tags and can not pass an emissions test to get renewed. Repairs quoted by the shop is over $2,000, with $500 of that just to perform diagnostic. Luckily I work from home, but starting April, I will have to commute to the office  
\- I have not filed my taxes for 2024 yet as I am waiting on additional documentation. Once filed, I was going to set up a payment plan to pay back taxes  
\- Current savings is approximately $800, trying to figure out what would currently be best use of this money (if any)  
\- I qualify for a credit consolidation loan to address credit card debt, but do not know if this is the best move.

This is my full financial picture. Any help and guidance are greatly appreciated. I would like to be in a much financial situation in 12 months (if not sooner).

personalfinance,passed over for promotion,What to do about my car,"So to start I was not someone who made good financial decisions in my early 20s. I was on my own at 19 and I learned basically everything the hard way, and I’m aware that I’ve made mistakes. I’m just looking for the best path forward.

3 years ago I was in a good place financially and I took out a loan on my 2018 BMW at around 27k with 6500 down. It’s a 6 year loan and monthly payments are 450.

Since then I have struggled immensely to keep up with it. Things changed drastically within the first year and I also had a mental health crisis that resulted in me neglecting my finances and destroying my credit. I could not stay on top of payments let alone maintenance, and even though things have stabilized a lot now I am in a really bad situation with the car.

Basically I still owe around 15k and the car has had severe issues, to the point I can’t get it to pass emissions and it isn’t drivable. It was recently towed without a flatbed which created issues with the suspension and the transmission. I replaced the parts I could afford to replace. Now it’s having oil leaks, coolant leaking into the oil, and break fluid leaking. Check engine light isn’t on for some reason but it’s not in good condition.

I currently make 19/hr and I’m finishing my education so financially I barely get by. My job has been teasing me for months with a promotion but it’s only a few dollars an hour.

Initially I was thinking I could roll over the car loan into a beater (something less than the 5 or so thousand my car is worth and cheaper to work on) but after more research on rolling over negative equity I’m thinking this wouldn’t work even with a co-signer.

So I’m thinking I just have to keep paying it off. I’m okay without a car for a while because I live in an urban area and the only place I was driving it was to and from work. But I’m not making enough extra income to save for another car and it would be hard to pull off a second job while I’m studying and relying on public transit.

What would you do in this situation? Also, please don’t judge me. Fixing my finances has been a long and stressful journey and I’m trying to let go of the shame I put on myself. I’m not looking for criticism, I know this is my fault. I’m just seeking advice on the best path forward.

Some people have recommended bankruptcy but I don’t have other debt (besides a small amount of student debt) and I don’t have reliable people in my life to co-sign for the next decade. I also have been working on building my credit back up and I don’t want to lose that.",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1fgon1u/what_to_do_about_my_car/,1726327663.0,crumbsandsuch,1fgon1u,advice_seeking
personalfinance,ask for a raise,"Co-signed my mother’s credit card, now see I have $22,000 in debt and my credit score dropped to 560.","I (25M) co-signed my mother’s credit card back in summer 2023. I won’t go too in to detail, but we were living with family and due to life changes had to suddenly move into a rental.

She’s always had a ton of debt due to raising me and my sister as a single mother during the recession. I thought she was making progress on this, but then she told me since her credit score was so bad she wouldn’t get approved for any of the places we were trying to rent, so she needed me to co-sign so we could get into a place quick. I was 23 and knew pretty much nothing about this stuff, and she told me it was only temporary and would be removed from my account later.  I believe when moving into the new place my credit score was in the 700s.

It’s now a year and a half later and I’m trying to move out and educate myself more about this stuff. I needed a credit report for one of the places I’m looking into, and upon looking it over I see my score has dropped down to 560, and there’s 22,000 dollars of debt on my card in my name. I was obviously very upset and asked her what this was about, she told me she was working on getting it removed and that it will go away after a couple months because she is refinancing it into a debt consolidation loan, but from what I’m reading this will be following me for another 7 years. On the report too it’s saying I’ve been getting hit with over due payments since August, up to 150 days in December, and then getting hit with a “charge off” every month since February.

I’m beyond confused on what to do, and honestly don’t understand all of this. I know I should have been more careful, but now that I’m in this situation I’m not sure how to proceed. I feel I’m just starting out and already have a massive stain on my credit report. She says not to worry about it, but I know she’s very bad with this stuff so I feel I can’t trust her. Is it true this will be removed from my record? Or am I just stuck with this stain on my account? 

How can I get out of this situation? Or at least any advice on how to improve it would be very helpful.

personalfinance,ask for a raise,I have epilepsy and don’t drive. Would it be a poor decision to spend ~45% of my monthly income on rent to be in walking distance to work?,"So I know that’s a scary %, but hear me out. I’m 25, live in the Charleston region of SC, and make about $48,000 annually before raises or bonuses, realistically around $50k this year. 

Since I can’t drive, I’ve been relying on family or Uber to get me to work, every single day. This is a new job for me, and while I will be provided a hybrid schedule after 45 days, I’ll still need to be in the office a couple days a week. 

It might sound like a small detail, but not being able to get myself to and from work everyday on my own accord is the most miserable, stressful part of the day. 

There are studio apartments down the road from my office, but they start at $1600/mo. This would be a huge chunk of my monthly income, but here’s how I’ve been justifying it in my head:

I have no car/gas paymenrs
No bad debts (small amount of student loans, but very manageable monthly payments)
I’d be buying my autonomy back
I have no problem living extremely frugally if it truly means I’ll get to be more autonomous

personalfinance,ask for a raise,Walking away from Car deal at the last minute,"Hey Y'all

I have a question as if I was being unreasonable. Yesterday my wife and I were out looking to buy a car. We found one we liked and negotiated the out the door price we were comfortable at, 31550. We had been preapproved for a 5.5% interest rate from our credit union and were putting 20% down. I told the dealership if they could beat our rate we would finance with them. They came back with 5.39% from Bank of America. Now a key moment of this is my wife has never financed a car, and she had left her drivers license at home. So I ran home to get it after we agreed to an out the door price. 

Now here is where I blew up the deal. She was back at the finance department, and I came in and looked at the deal sheet. She has not financed a vehicle before, and I feel like they tried to take advantage of that. We are planning on financing for 3 years. According to my numbers from our credit union (financing 25k for 36 months at 5.5% interest) I was looking at a payment of 754.90. When I looked at the deal sheet, the financed amount was 25032 at 5.39% for 36 months. But somehow the payment was 797. I plugged those numbers into 3 different loan calculators and came back with a payment of 755 a month on all 3. I asked the finance guy what was added to raise our payment by 42 dollars a month. He couldn't give me an answer, and acted like he was doing us a favor with the interest rate. We walked away.

  
My question is am I being crazy? Is there something I'm missing? Am I doing the math wrong? We had negotiated a little more the 1500 off the price of the car. When I did the math on that extra 42 it sure seems like they added something to negate that amount without telling me.",1000,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1j4ygp5/walking_away_from_car_deal_at_the_last_minute/,1741276130.0,tehPWNwhale,1j4ygp5,advice_seeking
personalfinance,ask for a raise,Would it be okay to ask for a $4 raise?,"Okay so just a quick summary of my situation…

1. Our area at work consists of 3 people now.
2. We got notice that 1 was leaving which would leave me and another person. 
3. My boss already said he wouldn’t be hiring another because our work flow has slowed down. 
4. My other coworker works at one speed and one speed only. Plus takes like 5 smoke breaks a day. 
5. I would be taking up the work of 2 people when the other leaves. 
6. My boss said this would be leverage to ask big boss for a raise. 

Would it be appropriate if I asked for a $4 increase since I would be taking up the work of 2 people, keeping our department a float? 

Other notes: 
*every time I’ve been on sick leave in the past or vacation the department always goes to sh*t…I have to come back and catch it up. 
*my manager freaks out when I’m gone and relies on me to help her with her stuff and keep the department a float. 
*without naming myself as a “lead” I’m practically a lead. 
*its very very difficult to find experienced individuals who have a good drive as a replacement. (So although everyone is replaceable it is very hard to find a good one for what I do). 
*Ive gotten decent raises every year, $1.50/$2.00 that I’ve asked for one. 

Anyways, I don’t want to seem crazy asking, I feel like it would be reasonable/good leverage in asking but I don’t want to be disrespectful either. 

However, I feel as if my worth is more than what I get paid now.

personalfinance,ask for a raise,"30-Day Challenge #4: Update your resume, get an internship, keep your wardrobe updated, or ask for a raise! (April, 2025)","# 30-day challenges

We are pleased to continue our 30-day challenge series. Past challenges can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/30daychallenges).

This month's 30-day challenge is to **Update your resume, get an internship, keep your wardrobe updated, or ask for a raise**. 

You've successfully completed this challenge once you've completed any one of these steps.

#Why is this important?

A 40-hour work week will take up about 24% of the 168 hours you have available in the week. If you're getting the recommended 8 hours of sleep, 36% of your day is spent at work.

This is why it's important to have a job that provides you with both income *and* personal happiness.

Even if you're gainfully employed and not thinking of jumping ship, you might still want to consider dressing for success, keeping your resume up-to-date, or even asking for a raise.

#1. If you're a student who is free this summer and haven't done so already: get yourself an internship!

Taking an internship or co-op while you're an undergrad is by far [one of the most effective career boosters out there](http://www.usnews.com/education/articles/2010/04/15/when-a-degree-isnt-enough), and can still benefit you even if it's unpaid. It allows you to network, get real world experience, get professional feedback, and [other important things](http://web.archive.org/web/20161015025146/http://www.laneterralever.com/the-benefits-of-internships-before-college-graduation).

So if you haven't done so, consider building your resume with intern experience, especially if you're free this summer. Speaking of resumes...

#2. Keep your resume up-to-date and constantly seek feedback

Even if you're not jumping ship, optimizing your resume and keeping it up to date is still important. Here are some good resources for resume building:

* [*Resume Writing*](https://www.rit.edu/emcs/oce/alumni/resume-writing) from Rochester Institute of Technology
* [*Resume Writing Tips*](http://www.resume-help.org/resume_writing_tips.htm) from resume-help.org
* [*The /r/resumes Wiki*](http://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/wiki/index)

If you have a professional profile (like LinkedIn, professional societies, or trade societies), make sure you update that too!

And one final thing: Don't forget to polish up your interview skills if you're going to go job hunting.

#3. Remember to dress for success

In the workplace, you should keep your hair neat (facial hair included!), your clothes should properly fit, and your outfit should be clean. Appearances and first impressions matter, and one source states ""41 percent of employers said that people who dress better or more professionally tend to be promoted."" ([Source](http://web.archive.org/web/20080805011749/http://www.cnn.com/2008/LIVING/worklife/07/30/cb.dress.for.success/index.html))

If you are out interviewing, make sure your suit or outfit is appropriate for the interview. There is also /r/femalefashionadvice and /r/malefashionadvice to help you on your way.

#4. Consider the best time to ask for a raise or promotion

Remember to **do your research** on this one before acting on it. A lot of raises are dependent on company policy, timing, negotiation skills, negotiation tactics, and several other things.

Here are some good sources on asking for a raise:

personalfinance,ask for a raise,Asking for a raise and overtime in one go,"I (24 F) have been at this company for 1 year. I'm a PM
At the begining the workload was fine but around 6 months in a person left and I picked up all their projects. I had too much on my plate, doing tasks which weren't in my job description (with no proper training). When a new person was hired this was offloaded to them. I didn't get any compensation for the extra hard work.

Recently (past 2 months) I've been doing between 1-1.5hrs unpaid overtime a day. Told my manager I've got too much on and he held back projects so I wasn't even more swamped. 
A week ago we found out another PM is leaving and her 50 projects are being split between the 3 of us remaining.
This isnt including any new projects. 

I was meant to get a promotion and role change begining of the year, but because of people leaving and too much work it's been postponed until May (and now likely later).

I want to be compensated for my work (paid overtime) and want a salary increase because I've been there a year.i don't want the increase to rely on my role change because who knows when that'll happen.

Any advise on asking for both of these? 
If I don't get compensation for my work, I would be looking to leave.

personalfinance,ask for a raise,How to continue the conversation with HR around our 401k?,"Hi everyone,

As our 401k options are horrendous (no index funds, expense ratios almost all above 1%, and those below are target date funds the latest being for 2040 so nothing suitable for people planning to retire after that), I’ve finally emailed HR about adding cheaper and better options. Below is the response I got. It sounds quite vague to me and like I cannot have any further role in this. The first thing I’ll ask is what is the timeline she’s considering, but does anyone have any advice on how to continue the conversation so I can make sure it actually achieves the goal (ie adding index funds and adequate TDFs)? 

« Many thanks for taking the time to share your detailed feedback on the 401(k) investment options. I appreciate the thought and analysis you’ve put into this, particularly your points regarding fund fees, actively managed investments, and what you noted on the range of target date funds available.
 
I would like to note that your concerns are well-taken, especially around the long-term impact of management fees and the importance of offering lower-cost, diversified options that suit a range of retirement timelines. These are all important considerations for any retirement plan, and I understand the importance of the matter to you and the team.
 
While I cannot commit to immediate changes, I will raise these points with [our provider] to better understand what flexibility exists within our current plan design. I’ll ask about the availability of lower-fee index funds and extended target-date fund options. This will help inform any future decisions we may consider regarding the plan setup.
 
Again, I appreciate your time in highlighting this, and I’ll keep you (and the other staff) informed as I learn more from [our provider]  and consider the next steps over time. »",77,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1kvudqm/how_to_continue_the_conversation_with_hr_around/,1748266148.0,FennelSalmonLemon,1kvudqm,advice_seeking
personalfinance,negotiate salary,Salary negotiation help,"Hello I’m currently being pursued by 3 companies for a mid/entry level embedded software engineer position. So im in the middle of leveraging the offers to get the best possible offer. In all honesty if all pay was equal I would struggle to pick one based on culture or the product. They are all great. All require relocation to the same tech hub (not California)

I’m having trouble deciding what I should do next. 

Here is the chronological order of what happened 

Monday: went to 2 in person interviews 

Company 1 interview  went great and I got an offer later that day for 95000 salary, no sign on bonus and no equity or yearly performance bonus. Pretty good health insurance. 

Company 2 is a start up. interview went also great and I did coding interviews with the CTO (who is a brilliant Stanford guy) and I was told I had a 90% chance of getting the position. All I had to do was meet with the head electrical engineer, who was on vacation. We then scheduled this for Wednesday.

Tuesday: bought some time with company 1 by saying I had to drive back to my current home about 6 hours away. Also I mentioned the offer from company 1 to company 3 who had not responded to my follow ups and was taking a very long time to schedule a final interview. This got things going and they scheduled the final interview this Friday.

Wednesday: 
Met with the head engineer of company 2. Everything went perfect. Later that day I got the offer from company 2 for 110k total comp. 100k base, 10k options, yearly bonuses, 5k relocation fee. Also good health insurance benefits, and free lunch everyday. 

Thursday (today): met with company 1 and mentioned the company 2 offer of 110k. They sent me an offer in the afternoon matching the 110k all in base salary. This is good since I I don’t have to take into account the possibility of the 10k options from company 2 being worthless in the future if they don’t IPO. 

Friday….. I have my interview with company 3 and I expect to kill it and also get an offer based on my previous interviews. I don’t think it will be very technical. Mostly culture fit which has never been an issue for me. 


What strategy should I do next??

I’ve come up with the following plan: 

Try to get company 1 to come up to 120-130 by giving a firm offer. My previous mention of company 2 offer was more open ended, this time I want to give a real hard counter offer. 

 If they budge then I can ask company 2 to match it or go higher to 130-140. Since I have not mentioned any other offers to company 2. 

I also think that company 3 can be a good bet in the sense that they are by far the biggest company. I think if I get a really good offer from company 1 or 2 I can use this to raise the pay anchor of company 3 before they even offer me the first offer. 

What do you guys think? I really would appreciate any help. My family and I want to buy a home soon so I am taking this very seriously.

personalfinance,negotiate salary,Negotiating salary after current company offered full-time?,"Not my situation, but one of my best friend's who doesn't have Reddit. We're in our mid-twenties for context. They've been at their job for 5 years working hourly and in the past year have grown to really dislike their job as its become more thankless, more work, more frustrating, and same pay. They requested to meet last year to renegotiate their contract into being full-time but were declined. They found a great job at a company they love and were on the phone with me going over their full-time offer about to sign it when they got a call from their boss who FINALLY offered them full-time with benefits.

They'd just gotten their offer from their prospective job today and have been very low-key about job hunting; their current job does not know they're looking to leave. I told them that they should ask for details on the full-time offer and (if its higher than the prospective one) use this to negotiate their offer at prospective job (which is decent and definitely a pay increase but they could make more in that position with their experience), but they got advice from a trusted person that they shouldn't negotiate in this case because its ""bad practice"". That kind of blew me away because I feel like this is a perfect situation to negotiate a contract with?

They told me they would consider staying at their current job if they got a MASSIVE pay raise, but they really want the other job, even if it was a semi-moderate pay cut from whatever their current job's offer is, which we don't know yet, but their current company is much larger and has more money.

personalfinance,negotiate salary,How bad of a move is it to take a 30k paycut for a better location?,"Hi guys, I reaching out because I feel like I'm going to go insane over thinking this move. Currently make 151k, 10% 401k match, 280 hours of PTO, 4/10 work week and 1 day WFH in New Mexico. I have the opportunity to move to a more desirable location (for us), where family will be closer and we'll be closer to the ocean (I grew up in the Caribbean so I miss it dearly). We currently have a 5 month old and the reason we are moving is because my wife wants to be closer to family and friends (I agree with her 100% btw and we're on the same boat). The offer I have is for 120K (I'm trying to negotiate closer to 130K but not sure what they will say since 120k is already at the top range for the position), 4% 401k match, 120 hours of PTO, 5 day work week with no WFH and the ""opportunity"" for a 10% yearly bonus based on company and personal performance. I'm wondering if I'm shooting myself in the foot by dropping so much salary and benefits, the wife is stay at home and will be for the next \~4 years. The area I'm moving too we are looking at houses in the 400k-500k range (Not sure I can even afford those) and we have enough to give a 100k down payment comfortably and not touch any of our retirement accoutns which add up to roughly \~270k and a 60k emergency fund. One of the things I'm struggling with is whether I should decline the offer at 120k and continue to look for something closer to \~140k (It could take upwards of 6 months I don't know) or just accept at 120K and in \~2-3 years look for something else.

personalfinance,negotiate salary,I undershot my first salaried job and now I’m super disappointed.,"I cannot stop thinking about how I messed this one up. I have been in the job hunt for 2 years and have been experiencing a lot of rejection. Some back story: I have worked at a restaurant for over 7 years with no real desire of going into a salary position because the demands didn’t fit my lifestyle. I was asked about moving up to management many times but always politely declined. I decided I wanted to spread my wings and get a job that was in line with my Bachelor’s degree and out of the service industry but mannnn have I had a long hard road. 

During this transition (which I thought would be much easier) I’ve found myself going back to service roles to keep myself afloat. I now have moved back home and desperately decided to reapply to the restaurant corporation I worked for for 7 years but now as a manager. They hired me on seamlessly but I was caught off guard with the salary expectations questions. I initially said 50k thinking that was average for the position. They happily agreed to take me on at that number. After sitting with it I realized I undershot myself and I negotiated 5k more. I’m happy I did but with more research and talking with current and past employees, most managers for this company start around 65-70k. I feel like a fool… I also feel like I can’t ask for more NOW. I just got my paycheck and I’m even more disappointed now. I am extremely grateful to find a position after years of searching but I just hate that it took me years just to fall back to the same place I’ve always been… and on top of that completely lowballed myself. I know this work inside and out and I could have leveraged that but I think my low self esteem from so much rejection and failed attempts to move in the direction I had planned made me completely unconfident in the entire situation. 

Honestly, any advice would be great. I know this isn’t the end of my career endeavors and I’m doing my best to learn from all this has taught me but i can’t help constantly conspiring with myself on how to ask for more.

personalfinance,negotiate salary,Company offered Relocation package.,"Me (27M) and my wife (27) were offered, same company. A relocation package to move states for the same role due to office location change. Here’s a breakdown

For me: 
7.5k upfront signing bonus
15k Relocation
25k retention bonus 1.5 years

For wife: 
7.5k upfront signing bonus
12.5k relocation 
15k retention bonus 1.5 years

Total:
15k signing bonus
27.5k relo(can pull cash) 
40k retention bonus. 


Salary: make around 150k right now, wife is around 70k. I’m still on a current retention bonus that would pay another 7.5k this year. The move would mean terminating our lease early and moving a few states away. 

No kids and no family in town, not many friends.

Would this make sense to accept and start the move process? Close to an extra 100k and could jump start our life 

Edit: COL is in between medium-high city and that number stays the same essentially (2% less COL in new city), currently rent, company covers taxes on the relo package and has preferred trusted vendors I can use that give enterprise discounts (large company discount). I can withdrawal the money and use it as cash associated with the move however we want. 

Possible negatives: 2.5% state income tax, what if it turned into a one way ticket (not likey unless the market drops like 2008), future growth opportunities might be less due to amount of company HQs in one vs the move. Still a business hub. No base salary increase(non negotiable). We have cats that would be stressed out by the move. Ability to fly out and scope the place out due to time constraints.

personalfinance,negotiate salary,Job offer seems too good to be true.. but I have worked my ass off,"I’m 25M I want to preface by saying I’m just curious because this has all happened so quickly and my family has historically not done well financially so I don’t feel comfortable going to them. My prior employer who hired me out of College and then went back to his old company wants me to follow him, I trust his opinions and he’s done very well for himself but I’m worried about leaving a great situation for “greener pastures” and getting burned. 

I graduated a year ago in March with a bachelors degree and landed a great job with a company of about 1,000 employees (laborers and office staff) they have “competitive salary” and a good 401k plan when you max it out, and pretty good other Bennies. (40% match of whatever you put in vs new offer of 3% dollar for dollar then .5 per dollar for the next 3%) 

I currently make ~82k and got a 3k bonus but received an offer at a Fortune 500 company with similar job duties for 100k plus annual bonus and company rig (before negotiations). Again this is my first year after graduating so that number immediately gave me sticker shock. 

Some additional information: current company si full of young up and comers so my chances of advancement are slowed due to people in their current positions plan on staying for a while. The new company wants to train me to advance quickly and move up the ladder, but I’m not sure their culture is quite as great as my current company.

Benefits are slightly worse with new company but still have health vision dental life at both. 

This turned into a bit of a vent but I needed to get it off my chest and figured I should get some opinions while I was at it. Good bad and ugly let me know if you think there’s anything you think I should consider

personalfinance,negotiate salary,What would you do? $13k windfall from FLAT broke,"This is my situation, imagine it were you. How can I make the most of this amazing windfall?

\*\*I am flat broke. Renting an apartment. Just came into $13,250 post-tax windfall CASH. Very few employment prospects. Decent amount of consumer debt. How should I best use this money? What would YOU do?\*\* 

I am currently FLAT broke. 33M, renter, medium cost of living U.S. city. Very low income. 

Was previously a relatively high middleclass earner. 2017-2023 I averaged about $75k/yr salary. This is relevant only because it explains my current expenses, having built my lifestyle up gradually to rival my income. 

I have no college degree. Have done well in very niche industry, lots of connections, however I've been without a job since last July. Prior to losing my last job, I've had multiple jobless periods of 4+ months over the past few years which have entirely eroded my savings. 

I very recently picked up a seasonal part-time job that pays $375/week. 

Here are my current debts, expenses, & income:  
Debts -   
Medical Debt in Collections - $9,500  
Credit Card Debt 17% APY - $4300/$4300 Max credit limit  
Personal Loans - $2,000

Expenses -   
Rent (w/ utilities) - $1200/month  
Phone, insurance, essentials, etc. - $175/month 

Income -   
Side job - $375/week  
Side hustles, landscaping, etc. - $45/week

My plan so far is to 1. Pay off half the credit card debt. 2. Attempt to negotiate with Medical Debt Collector, hopefully pay maybe 1/3 the total amount or get a very low payment plan. 3. Pay off personal loans. 4. Use remaining funds to relocate anywhere in the country I can land a job and/or place in a CD/HYSA until some worthy investment opportunity pops up. 4b.

personalfinance,negotiate salary,NYC Divorce Housing Dilemma: Keep 3.2% Mortgage or Risk Refinancing?,"My spouse and I are divorcing, and our only major asset is a NYC multi family home we bought years ago with a 3.2% interest rate (a unicorn by today’s standards). I’m stuck on how to split this fairly without blowing up my financial future. Here’s the situation:  

We owe $385K on the mortgage, and the house appraises at $1.2M ($815K equity). Two rental units cover the current mortgage payment, and I live in the third. My salary is $80K/year, and we have kids to support.  

My Fear: If I buy out my spouse’s 50% share ($407K), I’d need to refinance, losing our 3.2% rate and facing a $4K+ monthly payment. That’s terrifying on my salary. But selling means losing the rental income and facing NYC rents, which would eat up half my income.  

Options I’m Weighing:  
1. “Assume"" the existing mortgage to keep the 3.2% rate (if allowed?), then pay my spouse their equity share separately. But how? I don’t have $407K cash.  Plus closing costs etc. 

2. 60/40 equity split to reduce the buyout, but would that still require refinancing?  (Given the nature of our divorce I have some leverage here to negotiate - it might not work but I’m willing to try)

3. Deferred buyout. Co-own and rent all 3 units, but I’d need to move out and pay NYC rent myself.  

4. Sell and walk away, but then what?  This was a wise investment and feels silly to sell now. 

HALPPPPP!!!! 
- Has anyone successfully transferred/assumed a mortgage in a divorce without refinancing? How? 

- If I must refinance, are there creative ways to offset the higher rate (e.g., rental income agreements with my ex)?  

- Could a HELOC or second mortgage cover the buyout while keeping the first mortgage intact?  

I’m desperate for ideas - this 3.2% rate feels like a lifeline I can’t afford to lose.

I’m an entrepreneur with a startup that’s poised for growth. I’m hustling to scale it, and increased income isn’t off the table long-term. But right now, I need solutions that don’t hinge on “maybe” money.

Any advice from folks who’ve navigated divorce, real estate, or NYC’s insanity? Thanks! ",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1iwhsp6/nyc_divorce_housing_dilemma_keep_32_mortgage_or/,1740337795.0,Away_Stress7878,1iwhsp6,advice_seeking
personalfinance,negotiate salary,Advice on overall situation but especially the house.,"TLDR of history:

- Co-own house with ex BF. Owe 330k on market for $365k (dropped 4k from 369 last week). On market for not quite 45 days in LCOL area. Both he and I are moved out (him to his parents, me to an apartment I rent). I basically pay double rent to cover mortgage and expenses at $3400 for both the apartment and my portion of the house. 

-wrecked my credit pre-breakup thinking I’d have time to rebuild due to job loss and endless interviews amounting to nothing. Prioritized mortgage over credit cards. Luckily in 4 months I have built my credit score from 520 -> 605 by negotiating with creditors, closing two accounts on a repayment plan and managing to catch up others to keep them open but a 12 month no spend low interest payment plan. This reduce my total amount of credit and credit utilization and continues to drop it each month.

-finally about 6 weeks ago landed a contract that pays what I made previously (145k) and have a final for a w2 role at 125k plus a re up part time for the contract through the end of the year - I’m SO OKAY with working 60 hr weeks from home since I just did 6 months of 40 hours as a merchandiser and 30 hours as a server to make about 20% of my previous salary. I already don’t have a social life thanks to this. 



Now to my question, what are your thoughts on this? I’m worried the market has completely cooled. I’m dancing with the idea of pitching to my ex that we pull it off the market and rent for the next 12-18 months sell again or until I can feasibly buy him out. 

My thought is the rent will at least cover the mortgage and I can spend about $500 a month in saving for potential maintenance etc. instead of $1700 a month in mortgage and utilities for the house. If we sell within that time frame we still qualify for the exception of capital gains. I know I have to account for taxes on the rent for income which is still less than paying the mortgage portion.  any help appreciated thank you in advance.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1lzpxm5/advice_on_overall_situation_but_especially_the/,1752508018.0,Mindless-You1853,1lzpxm5,advice_seeking

I am in the process of financing a hvac system with a Synchrony credit card. The company I am buying the hvac from uses Synchrony to help customers make a big purchase. I am worried about applying for the credit card because in the terms it says 29% apr. The company assured me that once they install the hvac, they can lower the apr to 0% because they have a special deferred interest promotion. I am aware that deferred interest means I only receive no interest if I pay everything on time or else I have to pay back interest. However, can companies really change the apr like that or would I be locking myself into a loan for 29% APR? I don’t want to apply and get stuck with 29% APR.

personalfinance,promotion advice,How to deal with losing life savings,"Hi all, sorry in advance for a bit of a vent — looking for some perspective here from someone who has been in a similar situation. I (29 M) am the sole earner for a family of 5. I work for the federal government and had a wild year last year — I relocated out of state for what was seemingly a better job opportunity with a promotion and found it to be a terrible fit for both me and the family. We had previously owned a house which we sold and used the equity (around 75k) to purchase a new home (huge mistake in hindsight). The new location was in Florida. Less than a year in, we were desperate to get out of there, back to family, and I just so happened to get invited to an interview for a great job back near our hometown. We knew we may lose some money trying to sell the house so soon, and we were okay with it, but we didn’t realize just how bad it would be.
The FL real estate market bottom seemed to fall right out from under us at the same time we moved. After the house sat on the market for months with no offers, we were burning through our savings very fast (paying double rent/mortgage back in our home state on a 6.5% mortgage). We took the first serious offer we could get to stop the bleeding, but lost  everything we put down between selling at a loss and realtor fees, along with burning through the remainder of our savings. 

Now I’m starting over, no serious debt except for a truck payment, which I’m keeping. Salary is 136k but that doesn’t exactly stretch too far with 3 kids in the current economy. I save as much as I can for retirement and I can save around 600-800 a month for closer term goals, but I feel so far behind now compared to where I was. Thankful for the good job and VA loan eligibility, I know I could have had it worse. Has anyone had a similar experience, and how long did it take you to get back to feeling a little more stable afterward?

Trying to decide because i have an emergency fund so I thinking I should go back to prioritizing my retirement accounts since 22 and 23 I didn’t contribute nearly enough. I also have not been prioritizing my Roth but that’s because my income has gone up and I don’t know how smart it is to go pre tax any more.

Financially I don’t see why I put $3-$5k extra down to force myself into a 60 month loan with payments I want to make when I could save that money and do a 72 month loan and just pay like $90ish more over the minimum 72 month payment and pay it off in 5 years. Both loans are 0%

personalfinance,promotion advice,How do you responsibly enjoy life while saving money on a small paycheck?,"I know most advice here is very cut-throat - and I can respect that.

However I'm wondering how y'all make life work - realistically. Personally I make just above 40k a year before taxes. I'm in my mid twenties.

After everything else I have about 400-500$ left per month. That amount is after about 50$ in ""fun"" purchases e.g. subscriptions and my phone bill.

I essentially have no savings. Be so kind and don't ask. We all gotta start somewhere.

Now, I do want to save but I also want to enjoy life. I know the big milestones when it comes to saving e.g. 1-2k emergency fund, then 3 months of expenses, 6 months of expenses, maybe even 12 months of expenses. Then just add whatever you feel like / can. Invest in a Roth, 401k, stocks etc etc. the list goes on.

I would like to enjoy life while I can. I'm not talking about 10k vacations or Michelin star restaurants. Just live.

Concerts (incl. trip, tickets etc.) are easily 500-600+
Short vacations same thing. 
Eating out is easily 30-50 per meal, depending where and what you eat.

I'm not looking for advice like ""just get to 6 months savings first then start enjoying life"". Basic math tells me that lies 16-24 months in the future and that's if there are 0 emergencies or health issues in that time.

So I guess my question is, how do I even budget or plan anything with 400-500$ at the end of the month without being miserable and not being able to experience anything for the next 2 years?

Edit: I want to work with WHAT I HAVE RIGHT NOW. I know the same old answers about ""increase income"" but for multiple reasons RN that doesn't work for me (college = debt) and I don't have a typical office job where I can job-hop or negotiate a promotion every year. And I want to make this work now not in 5 years. That's the whole point of my post.

Edit 2: I did used to play video games a lot but my PC is 8 years old and essentially on it's last leg. And obviously I can't really afford to buy or build new one right now. Especially looking at tariffs coming up.

personalfinance,promotion advice,"Moving across country, house won’t sell","I was hired during the pandemic with a fully remote option. Now the company is beginning the process of having everyone come back to work. It’s not official yet, but the writing is on the wall. They’ve already said, ‘no promotions for remote workers’. I live on the west coast in a very small town, office is in Virginia. My career is very niche and it’s difficult to find WFH options anymore, so moving seems inevitable. My current job pays 100k+ and I love what I do and my team. My wife and I also just got full custody of our son and a move would be really good for our family, so we are all on board and ready to leave the drama behind us. 

So to the issue at hand. I own a house. Bought for 435, owe 405. Realtor initially told us it’s worth 525 back when we originally listed in May. 3 price drops later and we are at 460k today. 

After closing fees, I can drop it another 20k and still break even. However what happens if I sell below the break even point? I know it could trigger a short sale, but everything I read tells me I need to be in financial distress, plus the bank needs to pre approve. 

I live in a no-recourse state (Oregon), and we have no plans to buy for a while, as we may move again in 6 years when the kiddo graduates. Are there any ‘here’s the keys bank, wipe the hands’ options.

Also renting it out. How would that work for getting approved for a rental in Virginia. I think I can rent it for about 2200-2500, and the mortgage is 2600. Can I claim that income right away when applying for a rental myself, and offset most of the mortgage payment?

personalfinance,job offer negotiation,Received a new job offer but relocation costs are not enough. Should I accept or negotiate?,"Hi all,

I recently received an offer and wanted to ask for advice on it and how to respond.

I've got 3.5 YOE in engineering roles.

Current job/situation:
$114k salary
Expecting 8% bonus in April
Expecting 3% salary increase (this is a guess based on last year's increase)
Flexibility to work from home when not needed on site.
8-5 but leave at 4 almost every day.
Discussed promotion during yearly review, told to wait 1-2 years.

New job:
$140k salary
Sign on bonus of $10k
Relocation of $3k
No WFH
8-5

Other info:
Current lease payoff if I take the offer and move: $7k
Payback of relo to current company for leaving before 2 year mark: $10k
Would lose 75% of company match to 401k for leaving before 4 year mark: $11k

This has been a long negotiation through a recruiter for the new job. I communicated before about how I need to pay back the relo and my current lease.

Leaning towards not accepting the offer because of the low relo they are offering (previous two jobs - new grad and current role - had 10k-20k relo).

What is your advice in this situation? Obviously getting such a large pay increase is motivating me to accept but it will incur large moving costs right now.

Would you continue to negotiate, accept, deny?

personalfinance,job offer negotiation,Firmly believe I am being screwed by car dealership,"EDIT: I am heeding your advice and asking for an extra week and a refund in the meantime while I compare options. Thank you for your advice.

Hello all,

I’ve been looking to purchase a car for the last year or so, and tried over the last 6 months here and there to find a dealership that would work with me. I wanted to choose a dealership over buying something off a 3rd party site like FB marketplace or Craigslist simply because I’ve gone those routes three times in the past and every time I’ve ended up with a car that cost more to repair in 3 months time than it did to purchase it.

That being said, you probably are already under the impression that I have less than stellar credit and not a high paying job at the moment. You would be correct under both assumptions.

However, for context Experian reports me at just under 600 (598). So while it’s still bad, it’s not like I’m in the 3-400’s. I finally had enough saved up after the past year of working that I had around 5k to work with. Because of my experiences buying vehicles that were not worth their salt in the past, I decided I wanted to finance something reliable. I knew this would be a challenge as many dealerships are not willing to work with credit scores lower than a certain threshold. 

When I originally called around back in the beginning of this year, a lot of dealerships said no to financing but asked if I 1) had a co-signer (I don’t) or 2) if I could increase my down payment from 1500 up to 3-4K. At the time this was not something I could afford.

Fast forward last couple of weeks, and I have the money to finally afford comfortably putting 3k down. I found a dealership that said they could work with me, and I found a vehicle I was interested in driving (2019 VW Jetta). I applied online and then spoke to a rep on the phone who said “we might be able to explore financing or leasing as an option” but insisted that I was “qualified” for their “low credit program” that is “made to help people with low credit increase their score and get on the road”. I already knew at this point something was up, but was desperate to just get into a vehicle. & not just any vehicle — but something I could get in with the expectation that it’s not going to take multiple times to start, I don’t have to worry about it breaking down on me, and if anything was to go wrong with it mechanically that I had a dealership to perform repairs. 

I paid a $500 deposit to secure the vehicle and then went in a few days later (Friday last week) to make the arrangements to finalize the purchase. 

Now here is where it gets weird: I’m not trying to finance a 2025 or anything like that, the Jetta I applied for has 95k miles on it, and KBB lists the fair purchase price at between 9-12k. I figured okay they’ll probably charge a total of 13k for the vehicle to make some profit, but I’m putting down 3k so that would bring my loan principle down to somewhere around 10k, and then with a 36 month lease/financing plan I’m looking at ~280 before interest each month. With a 20% interest rate (they ended up offering between 18-20% at the dealership when I went), the monthly payment would come out to a total of around ~350/month. 

Boy was I wrong. They ended up giving me a face sheet that lists my payments as $345…. Biweekly. Something seems insanely off here. They said “we offer you 3 year warranty, 3 year maintenance, and GAP insurance included”. This all sounded great over the phone, but now I feel like I’d rather not have those perks if I could just get a fair monthly payment. They said this is all part of the “low credit program” and acted like they were changing my life. They basically saw I have $1500/month in disposable income (I live with my family and don’t pay rent) and decided to dip into that as much as possible. They said in 18 months “I can refinance to 30% lower payments”. But now I’d essentially be on the hook for almost $700/month. After 18 months with my down payment included I’d have already paid out $15k for a 11k car and only be halfway done with my term. 

TL;DR: getting screwed on financing terms due to being forced into a “low credit” program for people whose scores are 300-600 (my credit is a 598 according to experian and a 560 according to the dealership) 

My question here is what is the best way to address the disparity in what I calculated my payments to look like (350/month) versus what was presented to me at the dealership ($345 biweekly)? 

I would really like to negotiate with them and bring my monthly payment down. I might be landing a summer internship at AWS that would make my pay increase by at least 2-3x per month, but I don’t want to give myself false hope. As it stands, I’m essentially being asked to pay twice what I should be. When I asked the dealership what was going on with the payments being so high, they just said “interest” and pointed to the warranty/maintenance/gap insurance they provided and acted like they were doing me a favor. I paid my down payment, paid for insurance, and signed a preliminary agreement. However, the car I was buying (the Jetta) was not ready due to a tracker mismatch issue they had to fix so they gave me a loaner car to use until it was ready. 

I just got a text this morning that the car is ready and my official signing is tomorrow, but if you were me and wanted to get yourself a fair purchase price on this vehicle before signing to a predatory agreement (I’m not stupid I know what this is, I’m just desperate for a reliable vehicle), how would you go about it?

Thank you for any advice in advance and I don’t need to hear advice about buying a beater, I need advice with this situation I’m currently in. And yes, I understand cheaper options exist, I’m just looking for the most reliable one.

personalfinance,job offer negotiation,Homeless & Behind on Car Payments,"My nephew made some poor choices and I don't know how to advise him going forward.

He is currently $17k behind on his car payments. Bank is trying to repossess his car. He called the bank to negotiate and the best they can offer is $2,900 per month for six months to get back on track. He can't afford that. He is currently sleeping in his car because my brother kicked him out.

He currently works two food service jobs. In addition, he wants to drive for Uber Eats, but he told me he is having trouble getting car insurance (possibly because of the repo status?). Long term, he wants to join the Navy, but he failed the ASVAB. He's currently studying to retake the ASVAB on the side.

I advised him to go to go to a homeless shelter, apply for food stamps, and apply for Medicaid. I already gave him about $600 for new tires (they were bald), gas, and food. I can toss him another couple hundred. Here are my questions:

1. What is the best use of his limited cash and paychecks?
2. What should he do about the car? Should he just keep sleeping in it until the repo man finds it? Should he voluntarily surrender it?
3. What else would you advise him to do at this point?

\*\*\*EDIT\*\*\*

So it turns out he is only 4 months behind on payments ($1800 behind), but the bank is demanding the full amount ($17k) and is unwilling to negotiate beyond their six-month installment offer (even if he paid $1800 today and brought himself current). The KBB on the car is about $12k.",36,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1ljmehv/homeless_behind_on_car_payments/,1750797716.0,Nephewizeffed,1ljmehv,advice_seeking

personalfinance,job offer negotiation,Buying a car a 17 & I don’t want to make the wrong choice,"Hey everyone, I'm 17, about to turn 18 in a month, and looking to buy my first car. Altogether, I have roughly $4,000 from savings, and my grandmother is lending me an additional $5,000 to put toward a down payment. Originally, I planned to pay for a car in full for under $9,000, but recently I found a 2019 Honda CR-V listed at $17,500. It has 50,000 miles and no accident history.

Personally, I love the car because I know it would be reliable, fuel-efficient—which is my main concern—and could last me well over five years. According to Kelley Blue Book, the car typically sells for $21,000 to $23,000, so this seems like a good deal.

I currently have a job that pays $17.50 an hour, and this summer I’ll be working over 50 hours a week with overtime, I also have an additional $1,000 in savings. I'm completely new to finances and have no credit, so I’m unsure how to go about buying the car, and my parents haven’t offered much advice. From what I understand, I could try to negotiate the price with the private seller, use the $9,000 as a down payment, and get a loan from a bank to cover the rest. I’d then pay off the loan using my job income, making double payments to pay it off faster.

I’m not sure if buying this car is a smart or viable option. I’d like to have my own vehicle by the time I need to start commuting to college, and I’ve heard that car prices tend to go up during the summer. Financially, I’m not too concerned about college, after aid and scholarship money is going to be \~$400 per semester so I want to focus my money on a car. Thank you!

personalfinance,job offer negotiation,Can I ask for a signing bonus to offset a $25K forgivable loan from my current employer?,"Hi all — I’ve received a job offer for a **CFP-level role** at a company I’m really excited to join. The salary and comp package are generous, and I’m happy with them as offered.

That said, I’m currently under a **forgivable loan agreement** with my current firm. It was offered as **transition assistance tied to a book of business I brought in**, and if I leave early (which I would be doing), I’m required to repay the unvested portion — about **$25,000**.

The new role is a **financial coaching position** with no expectation to bring over clients or production, and the company has stated that **salary and bonuses are standardized and non-negotiable** for all planners.

I don’t want to seem pushy or ungrateful — I genuinely want the job and this is the **only item I’d be asking about** — but having part of the repayment covered through a signing bonus or transition stipend would significantly ease the move.

Is it appropriate to bring this up before accepting the offer? And if so, what’s the best way to position it so it’s taken seriously, but doesn’t come off as entitled?

personalfinance,job offer negotiation,"33, married, 1 kid and another one the way. We're miserable in our current situation. Looking for help to get out.","Tldr; Have some savings, decent but unstable income, high expenses and want to revamp my financial life.


Hello all, I am a 33m married to a 27f with soon to be 2 kids. I'm looking for advice on what is the best course of action given a tough situation. 

I do contract work and have been doing my work on the road now for 2 years. Last year I pulled in 130k (Net) and my family went with me to jobs. My wife got sick of the instability of moving and asked for a permanent place to settle down. I continued to travel, but with the second baby on the way she is at her wits end with me not being there 5 days a week (rough pregnancy).

Dropping contract work will take my net pay down to about 65-70k with almost no room for career growth. Alternative is wife can work and I can quit. Her earning potential is likely 60-65k (net)  for 1-2 years and could potentially go up to 150k (gross) after about 5 years (project management with engineering background).

We are leaning towards her working instead and it is a non negotiable for us to send kids off to daycare so only one of us will work. (I have considered part time evening job, but my career field does not offer this, so it'd likely have to be a generic 15-20/hr job). 

Both of us want to go back to school over the next decade and also try and buy a house. She wants to get a PhD and I will be pursuing an MD/DO.

So, now to our finances:

Current income is 2500/week after taxes
25k in savings
20k in retirement 
19k left on car loan @ 3% (800/month)
2 rents (travelling healthcare worker):
Rent 1: 2400, Rent 2: 400
Monthly healthcare + insurance is a doozy at about 1000/month base not including the baby coming. (Cancer survivor and ongoing care is expensive)
Utilities: 300/month
Car insurance: 100/month
Food: 7-800/month
Phones: 90/month
Gas for travel work: 250/month
Misc expenses: 500/month

We need to make a transition but it terrifies me with how expensive our lives are and simply taking a full time role doesn't seem viable. I don't plan to pay off the car until after any transition is made + baby is here.

My questions:

1. What to do with my savings over the next 6 months while we get out of the situation? When is it prudent to pay off the car?

2. We can drop the 2nd rent entirely and the first rent we can reasonably cut down to 1500/month, but space will be tight and we can only handle that temporarily while we get out of a mess (2br apt for a family of 4), health insurance and expenses can be dropped to 250-500/month, gas can be reduced, misc expenses reduced. Can I afford to make the transition to the wife working?

3. It seems like a pipe dream for now, but at what point is it reasonable to purchase a home if we assume my wife can achieve 150k income in 5 years (starter homes are 350k in my area)? Is it crazy to purchase if we know we will both stay locally for school? Current rents are about 2k/ month for a 3br home.

I feel so stuck and just want a way out of what feels like a mess that doesn't force my family to make so many sacrifices and be separated.

I recently lost my job, and I have $27k in credit card debt and $125k in student loans. Unemployment benefits are $1,458 so not enough to cover my minimum payments and rent. My expenses are $2,353 (not including food, car, pet care etc.). I have $10,238 in savings, $15,541 in retirement, and no car payments. Realistically, I only have enough for five months using my savings to pay the minimums. I spoke with  Capital One, but they only offer hardship programs if you are behind on payments  - is it worth it to let it get behind?

I can negotiate after July to get a pause on my private student loan for two months and then a reduced payment plan for 6 months. Unfortunately, my federal student loan will be upwards of $475 in September, unless I am still unemployed. Everyone is against liquidating a retirement account on this thread, but I was considering paying off my lowest card with my retirement to reduce my monthly burden. 

I previously tried balance transfer cards, taking a personal loan with a credit union for a lower interest rate, and I even looked into debt consolidation programs, but they wouldn't change the monthly payments much, and the fees were bad. Should I consider bankruptcy at this point? 

It is also an option to temporarily move in with family, but it would cost $1,000 to move, and I want to stay where I am.

personalfinance,how to get promoted,"This year, I made 70k. It doesn't ""feel"" like I made 70k. Help?","Hi Reddit.

I'm a 27 year old living in Dayton. I have what I consider to be a good job that matches my values. I live together with my long-term partner who is currently looking for work. We have an apartment that isn't luxurious but doesn't fall apart, a car that breaks down at least every other month, and all our basic needs met but some things we agree that we want (for example - buying curtains, rods, and hooks) that we've had to set on the backburner for a while as we prioritize.

I recently got my last paycheck this year. My yearly income just barely eeked over $70,000. When I saw that, I was ecstatic. That was more than my parents made, combined, when I applied for college back in 2016. That number has come from me being promoted, twice, in the company I like (dealing in tissue donation), as well as earning a certification in my field, working third shift, and working some time on weekends. By all metrics I am proud of that number.

The issue is... I feel like I'm still ""behind"", in a way, in my finances. Don't get me wrong - I'm not the type to worry about climbing the corporate ladder and always vying for more. I'd be happy to have my bills paid and to start saving. But often, especially when unexpected trouble comes up, we end up behind rather than ahead.

For reference, an average month for us looks like this:

Pay - 1600 twice a month after taxes (and healthcare/401k etc)
Rent - 1079 a month.
Student Loans - 650 a month, private through Discover, does not qualify for consolidation or help w/ repayment
Electricity - 150 to 250 a month depending on usage.
Wifi - 107 a month.
Insurance - 120 a month. 
Gas bill - 50 a month.
Water and sewer - 25 a month.
Hulu - 20 a month.
Groceries - 100 per week.
Gas/Car - 40 per week.

After that we'll normally order food for the two of us maybe once a week, if not every other week. I have a single credit card that I use for gas and for emergencies, and once a month I try to pay at least 1/3 of the balance (it never gets above $400).

On paper it seems fine. Then in the moment, we struggle. Sometimes it's something like, we used our grocery budget this week, but we forgot to buy shampoo or some other essential and have to run back to the store. Sometimes it's my car breaking down. In the summer, I had some health trouble that I had to pay for. Because of that, we always have enough to pay the bills but never enough to put in savings, and I sometimes I feel concerned about if something were to hapoen to us. Not to mention - the car is nearly 20 years old, but it's paid off, but we can't afford a payment on a new car, and somehow despite me paying my bills on time my credit score is pretty rough, too.

Am I missing something? Sure, we eat out once in a while, but we try to limit ourselves to once every week or two as a special treat. Sure, we could try to use less electricity or something, but we already barely ever have the lights on. And I know that once my partner finds work, a dual income will make things easier - they've been applying nonstop to hundreds of places on Indeed for about 7 months with no leads, and I get it, because 2 years ago before I got this job, I was in the same boat - almost a whole year where no one would hire me.

I don't know. I feel like if I'm making so much money and we're not getting anywhere with savings, I must be doing something wrong, so I turn to you, Reddit.


EDIT: Okay, there are now a ton of comments - first, THANK YOU to everyone taking the time to talk this through with me! I'm going to be changing the way I pay off my credit card to avoid having a balance, I'll be looking into my tax/insurance/401k info to figure out exactly how those are affecting my take-home pay, and I'll also keep in mind that money just osn't worth what it used to be.

Some things I wanted to address:

My partner has been trying to find a job - any kind of job. Part time, full time. Schools, subbing, fast food, retail, admin positions, libraries, working for small businesses, working at our local mall. Grocery stores, tax offices, doctors offices, and everywhere in between. I've watched her apply to a few dozen jobs a week, every week, for months. I've driven her to the few interviews she's been offered. I understand that her finding a job will make things easier, but please be respectful and understand that she's been trying very hard in that regard.

Also, my earnings have not been 100% consistent year-round. While I work third shift, I may work more or less on weekends (usually not a choice but instead a direction), and we also get a sizeable bonus in the spring that accounts for a portion of my income.

My company is one that offers a 401k match, health, dental, vision, a (relatively) flexible schedule, a good amount of PTO, and a work environment I enjoy. 

Also, thank you for having grace with me. I'm a young adult who's trying to get serious about understanding and controling my finances for the first time, and what may seem obvious to some (example: your credit card should not hold a balance!) is news to me.

personalfinance,how to get promoted,Concerned about a mortgage that is ~50% of my net income.,"I'm considering putting an offer in on a small condo, mostly at the urging of my parents, but also because I desperately need to get out of the house I'm renting a room in due to harassment from another tenant (something that I am trying not to let impact my judgement/decision-making). But, for context, I only earn \~$4,000 net each month. My mortgage payment & HOA dues combined would could to roughly $2,080/month. I'm in a HCOL state (CA). I am preapproved to buy. The goal of a condo is to live alone, no roommates and no spouse/partner/girlfriend wanted - so I wouldn't have the benefit of someone else's income for padding.

I've spoken to a few folks & browsed a few different forums. I see opinions ranging from ""50% of your net is way too much"" (I'm inclined to agree, I ideally wanted closer to 30%) to ""50% of your net is the new normal, 30% is outdated"" (wouldn't surprise me if it was true). My parents are of the opinion that the high initial monthly expense is 'just part of growing up', and that it's inevitable my salary increases over time to balance out the mortgage cost. I'm less confident in my salary going up over time, but I also have been petrified of being laid off again after my last company gave me the ""You're being promoted! Just kidding, your department is being laid off."" treatment.

My folks would/do intend to help out - I recognize I am extremely fortunate & privileged in that way. It also means that I am even more hesitant to waste their effort & financial gifts if I'm not able to sustain the payments. I wouldn't expect them, nor would it be right for them, to swoop in & save me if things go belly-up.

When it comes to managing finances, I am very frugal. My dad's also a career accountant so my sister & both learned good money-management skills. Again, something I'm very fortunate to have. I have excellent credit (770+), would have a decent-but-not-great emergency fund leftover (will sit at \~4 months of expenses covered if I do purchase), and virtually no debt (a \~$500 credit card I rack up & pay off each month).

Would my budget be tight? Absolutely. Would my lifestyle need to change much to accommodate it? No, not really. I don't have superfluous subscriptions or loans (no Netflix, no Prime, no car payment, etc.). It *would* mean less spending money, and definitely means no big expenses for the immediate future (mostly means no remodels or the like to the home).

It just feels risky, and almost selfish in a way. Risky for obvious financial reasons, selfish because it would mean prioritizing my comfort & happiness over the amount of money I save on cheap accommodation.

**TL;DR - I net \~$4k/month, and mortgage would be \~$2k/month. Is this viable at all or should I rent another year, hope for a higher salary & pray I don't get priced out in a year's time?**

I'd love to get other opinions, especially any testimonials from folks who decided to do the \~50% of net mortgage - good or bad experiences.

personalfinance,how to get promoted,How to clear debt with a baby on the way,"Hi all! My wife and I are expecting our first baby (unplanned), but I'm in a lot of debt. We live in a HCOL area (northeast US) but both have well paying jobs. I WFH and she's in the medical field. I make about $80k/yr before bonuses (6-8% depending on our teams performance), and she makes $125k base but with quarterly bonuses ranging from $7-10k per quarter. Her salary won't be changing much year over year, while I expect to grow my salary via promotions and merit increases. I should be getting promoted in March 2026 to increase my base to $90k. I was just promoted this March moving from $70k-80k. Monthly costs are:

* Rent is $2850 split between us
* Amex: $13,850 18% APR
* Apple: $12,000 22% APR
* BofA: $10,500 20% APR
* Barclays: $10,000 23% APR
* Chase: $10,200 23% APR
* Car: $595 (she pays for this as its hers)
* Car Insurance: $175 split
* Cell phone: $175 (We bought our cell phones a year ago on this plan and are bundling Netflix/Disney+)
* Internet: $100 split
* Sallie Mae: $300
* Student loans: Both of ours are paused currently as we were enrolled in SAVE. Interest will start kicking in 8/1/25. I have about 60k; she's screwed as she has about $400k for med school.

Savings:

* My 10-15k of savings were depleted while I was out of a job
* She has been able to save about $40k
* 401k I have about $40k in mine, she just started hers last year and has about 20k as she maximizes contributions and maxes out her roth IRA as well
* We got about 6-8k in wedding gifts that we set aside for a house. This is going to be my contribution to our downpayment as she has more savings to contribute towards it.

The credit card debt was accrued while I was out of a job for roughly 8 months in 2022-2023, we were moving around a lot due to my wife's externships. She did residency for a year from 2023-2024 where she was only making about $45k, so she wasn't able to contribute much during that time. She finally started making good money last summer and it took us about a year to get back into the groove of things. I was making minimum payments on cards and cleared out some other credit card debts using the snowball method. I've been trying to limit my expenses (I cook dinner for us, we cut down on waste, I don't go out to bars or out with friends often). I'm entering my busy season at work, so won't really have time to pick up other shifts, but last winter I worked at a warehouse for 10-15 hours/week making about $20/hr. It helped bring in a couple extra hundred a month but it was difficult to maintain working 7 days a week so I left in March once I got my bonus and merit increase.

We just found out that she's pregnant today. My mind is in moderate panic mode as I thought I was going to take this summer to figure out my credit card debt, maybe reach out to NFCC.org to get a lower interest rate and just pay it down over a couple years. But now there's a ton of expenses coming up and its crunch time.

I also looked into some balance transfer card options (Citi Diamond Preferred Card) but I hear sometimes you don't get much of a credit limit on that to truly utilize that 0% balance transfer. There's also the consideration of a personal loan. Again, we were thinking of buying a house in the next year or two so I was trying to keep my credit report relatively clean of new applications etc.

Right now, my plan was to get my wife to take on the full rent and other utility expenses. This would give me about $1500 a month to put towards paying debt down. I would opt in for an NFCC type of situation where my cards close but the interest rate is lowered. Then I'd slowly knock out those debts and pay extra on the worst APR ones or cards that don't qualify (When looking into this I don't think I can do this with my Apple Card). Are there any other reasonable actions I can take to tackle this issue (and ideally be able to buy a house in a year or so?) Also, are there things I should definitely NOT do since I am looking to buy a house in the future? I'm trying hard to dig myself out of this hole without burdening my wife too much and I definitely don't want to risk our future at the same time.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1m1yxa7/how_to_clear_debt_with_a_baby_on_the_way/,1752729014.0,OtherwiseTarget7650,1m1yxa7,advice_seeking

personalfinance,how to get promoted,Financially planning to purchase a house in 10 years,"I (25F) recently started my professional career. Now that I’m no longer a retail employee making barely over minimum wage, I’m looking to plan out my financial future.

I have secure a very stable position in my local government. I’m unlikely to increase my salary by job jumping, but there’s a very steady track record of internal promotions and internal department transfers. More importantly, the job provides me with very nice health insurance and retirement packages. And free transportation.

I don’t have a car and will not need one for the foreseeable future. My student loan debt is under 11k and I am capable of paying it off entirely but doing so would leave me uncomfortably little savings. 

I currently live with my parents and thus rent is not a concern for now—they’ve rejected my offers to financially contribute as they’d rather I save for my eventual independence. I suspect they won’t push me to ‘leave the nest’ for at least the next two years. They may permit me to remain even longer if I can demonstrate I’m working towards homeownership. 

Government salaries are stable but not overly generous. With my current lack of meaningful expenses, I believe I can set aside 10k a year for the eventual down payment for a house—so 50k by the time I’m 30 or 100k by the time I’m 35. A pitiful amount with the current housing prices. I’d ideally like as large a down payment as possible to minimize my mortgage payment even if I can expect at least one substantial raise by the time I’m 35.

And it’s unlikely I’ll be able to maintain my current rate of ‘savings’ for more than a few years.

Thankfully, I do have time on my side. I’m not looking to purchase a house today when I’m 25 but in ten years time when I’m 35. I have time to grow the money.

Given all of the above, how would you recommend I invest my money as to best grow my housing fund? 

I’m also planning on setting up meetings with the financial advisors at my bank and the financial advisors I have access to through employee services at work. I ask reddit in order to get myself a starting point to research and ideas it bring to my FA(s) that I otherwise would not have thought/been aware of.",7,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1lm1x0i/financially_planning_to_purchase_a_house_in_10/,1751050411.0,ReflectionOfShards,1lm1x0i,advice_seeking
personalfinance,toxic workplace,"I quit my job in October, but haven't seen my 401k check/paperwork in the mail at all, what do I do?","So like the title says, I had to quit my job back in October. The workplace was unbelievably toxic and there was Nepotism with every aspect of the job, including the fact that I was passed up on promotions just so they could promote the GM's niece who was only 19 and too immature to be put in a manager position. (But I digress, I've quit since then). I had worked there for 3 years when I decided to quit. 

Every time I've had to leave a job that's given me 401k benefits, I've always had a check in the mail from my contributions to said 401k. However, I haven't seen ANYTHING from this company and I know I've been putting money into this 401k, 10% of every paycheck actually. I don't have a lot of money right now and actually really need it to be cashed out (I'm aware of the 10% tax payment I'd be paying on it). 

Does anyone have any advice on what to do? I'm ready to reach out to the company regarding this issue, but I'm not entirely sure what to do.

personalfinance,toxic workplace,Trying to figure out how to approach taxes this year with new job,"Hey all... I recently left a toxic workplace where I was making 140k a year. I now make less than half that at 63k. I wasn't prepared to leave this job and luckily with my wife working she adds another 45k or so to our income.

My question is in what order should I begin to pay off my loans? I know typically you want to pay off the highest interest debt first, but I think my situation might be unique, or maybe I just need to be told it's not?

My debts are as follows:

Credit card #1- $6k at 29.99% (I typically pay about 15% above the minimum for this each month - 200-300$ of which about 120$ is interest)

Credit card #2 - 1.8k 0% interest, this I plan to pay off by April 20th


Car loan - 20k at 6% (I pay 553 a month.)

Personal loan - 11.7k at 16% (I pay 520 a month)

IRS - 9k (I have this put aside in a savings account ready to be paid, I plan on paying in October at which point I'll have accrued an extra 400$ in fees and interest)

Our budget is solid, other than we're getting used to a new lifestyle, I think in a few weeks we can reel it in a bit more and save more from our paychecks, right now I save about 300-700 a month after bills and debts etc

I'm also wondering if It makes more sense to use the money I have set aside for the IRS on either my personal loan, or half of it for my 6k credit card debt. I'm trying to save the most each month but also not be screwed come tax time. I plan on filing an extension and paying in October so that I can use my savings in case of emergency or to make it easier each month by paying off the loan or credit card debt. 

Thanks for reading and appreciate any and all feedback

personalfinance,systemic burnout,What’s the Best Way to Ritualize Month-End Closure and Start Fresh?,"*Use intention, review, and ritual to close each month with clarity and power.*  


# Why Month-End Rituals Matter (and Most People Skip Them)

# The Problem:

People jump from month to month with no real pause. The result? Mental overload, burnout, and repeating the same mistakes without reflection. Without a structured closure process, we drag emotional, energetic, and practical clutter into the next cycle.

# Why Ritual Works:

Ritual gives us a structured pause, a moment of reflection, release, and renewal. In psychology, rituals are shown to reduce anxiety, reinforce habits, and increase intentionality. Energetically, they help us clear stagnant energy and create room for the new.  


# What Is a Month-End Closure Ritual?

A month-end closure ritual is a personal process designed to bring **conscious reflection to completion**. It blends mindset work, emotional awareness, and sometimes spiritual tools to close out a time cycle intentionally.

# Purpose of the Ritual:

* Review what happened
* Release what didn’t serve
* Realign with your next-level self

# Formats It Can Take:

* 30-minute solo journaling with a candle
* Group circle with shared intentions
* Private tarot or astrology check-in
* Energy-clearing bath and intention-setting meditation

# 

# The Energetics of Endings and Beginnings

Every month carries a distinct energetic arc. We start with high hopes, get challenged by life’s curveballs, and (hopefully) evolve by the end. Skipping closure cuts off the cycle — it’s like finishing a novel and never reading the last chapter.

# Energetic Benefits of Closure:

* Resets your nervous system
* Closes energetic leaks (mental clutter, regret, unfinished tasks)
* Creates emotional space to receive the new
* Builds momentum instead of burnout

# Spiritual Insight:

The moon cycle supports this naturally. The waning moon and last quarter phase, which occur in the final week of each lunar cycle, are ideal for closure, review, and letting go.  


# Cleanse Your Space + Energy

# Why Cleansing Works:

Psychologically, cleaning your space reduces stress and increases focus. Spiritually, it clears stuck energy and opens space for the new.

# Physical Cleansing:

* Clean your workspace, desk, or altar
* Empty trash, file paperwork, clear inbox

# Energetic Cleansing:

* Burn herbs (sage, cedar, palo santo)
* Use sound (bells, bowls, music)
* Take an Epsom salt bath with intention



# Pull Cards or Use Astrology for Insight

# Why It Works:

Tarot and astrology provide objective insight from symbolic systems. This helps bypass the ego and access intuitive wisdom.

# How to Use Tarot:

* Ask: “What did I learn this month?”
* Ask: “What energy am I stepping into next month?”
* Ask: “What should I focus on releasing?”

# How to Use Astrology:

* Look at the moon phase at month’s end
* Check any transits to your natal chart (e.g., a Saturn square = lesson time)
* Journal your emotional patterns tied to lunar cycles



# Release What You’re Done With

Letting go is essential to move forward. This isn't just mindset — it’s energetic hygiene.

# How to Release:

* Write what you’re done with and burn or tear the paper
* Use water: shower, bath, or even cry with intention
* Say it out loud: “I release \_\_\_. It no longer defines me.”

# Energy Work Options:

* Cut energetic cords in a visualization
* Use affirmations like “I call my power back”
* Visualize old patterns melting away with a candle



# Set the Emotional Tone for the Month Ahead

We often skip to goals, but **emotions drive actions**. Setting an emotional tone shapes your nervous system and behavior more than a task list.

# Emotional Tone Examples:

* Confident → “I act boldly even when uncertain.”
* Peaceful → “I protect my time and say no easily.”
* Focused → “I eliminate distractions with love.”

# Ways to Lock It In:

* Choose a theme song or playlist
* Anchor with scent (essential oil roller)
* Create a phone background with your chosen word

# Ritualize It Your Way

The more personal the ritual, the more powerful it becomes.

# Create Your Ritual:

* Light a candle with your intention
* Speak your release + your new focus out loud
* Move your body to transition energy (walk, dance, stretch)
* Close with breathwork or prayer

# Time Required:

* 20–60 minutes
* Once a month, ideally same day or phase (like last Sunday or waning moon)



# Final Thoughts – Closure Is Power

Each ending is a chance to:

* Reclaim your time
* Reframe your story
* Reenter your next cycle clearer, calmer, and stronger

A month-end ritual isn’t just a nice idea — it’s a transformational practice that upgrades your focus, energy, and mindset.

# 3 Quick Wins to Try This Month:

1. Reflect on 3 wins and 1 lesson
2. Burn one thing you’re done with
3. Choose a word that guides your next month",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1kb9mi9/whats_the_best_way_to_ritualize_monthend_closure/,1745993639.0,coto_app,1kb9mi9,advice_seeking

personalfinance,surviving my job,Terminal Cancer - Live off my 401k?,"Hello,

I am looking for some financial advice.  I have terminal cancer (Multiple Myeloma Stage 3) and will reasonably be deceased within 3-5 years.  Most likely sooner.  However, I want to use that 3-5 years time frame of reference if possible.  I am also disabled from multiple broken backs from the cancer eating my spine away.

Treatments and medical bills to survive took everything I had ever saved financially except my 401K.  I have a 401K with $270,000 that I can take from unpenalized due to my diagnosis.  My current income is $5,000 each month from Social Security.  This is my only source of income.  I currently have $6,400 in my last bank account.

I have an $8,000 per month debt outgoing.  I had to use a credit card to survive on and at this point it has a $30,000 balance.

I was thinking of taking out enough to pay the CC off, then add $3,000 per month to my $5,000 to meet all of my monthly debts of $8,000.  This was my simple math calculation:

270,000 - 54,000 (20% for IRS) = 216,000

216,000 - 13,600 (4.5% for State Tax) = 202,500

202,500 - 30,000 (Crredit Card Payoff) = 172,500

172,000 / 3000 per month = 57.5 months of $8,000 income

At some point my wife intends to get a job to help and I am going to try to find a way to make money before I am gone in hopes to sustain my family when I am deceased.

Any thoughts, recommendations or ideas?  I was thinking that if I didn't take it all out at once to lose the money it's making me plus I wouldn't be moved into a massive Tax Bracket for a single year.

personalfinance,surviving my job,"Can’t afford home, bills or baby","I’ve dug a hole I don’t see myself getting out of.

1. I live (wife and newborn) in a home that is far too expensive. We have a great rate(3.125%)but I just can’t afford it. It’s a nice neighborhood But there’s on avg. $500 a month of HOA fees. Been here for 4 years, definitely some equity but since I can’t really afford it, I’ve been slowly accruing debt.

2. We just had a baby, bills are already adding up quickly. We have no savings for him or ourselves. Adding both him and my wife to my insurance totals 1400 a month for all of us 

3. I do have a steady job that I enjoy and pays decent (avg. 90K) but after the health insurance is taken out and the mortgage is paid I feel like I’m left with very little to survive off of. Because of my income I don’t qualify for any help.

4. My wife hasn’t worked for a while, she had some medical things going on but now she’s taking care of the baby. Decent Day care near us would be more than any job she might get so that seems unreasonable now.

5. Credit card debt has increase to about 23,000 and I’m nearing my limit. I only have one credit card.

I’m not sure what I should do. I think maybe selling the house and moving to something smaller would be good but in this economy I can’t imagine paying all that much less. Also renting seems crazy also since monthly rent is about the same as what we pay for our mortgage unless we move to a much lower income area. I could also pick up another job but I’m already picking up extra hours at my current job and side hustle jobs won’t make me as much as the $50 an hour I get now.

Any additional advice, ideas?

Additional info.

No car payments 

Take home income is about 3600 a month after health insurance is taken out (up to 500 extra a month depending on overtime). I have a hybrid position where my salary is set if I meet a certain amount of billable hours each week and any additional hours counts towards hourly rate. 

We have monthly and quarterly HOA, which averages out to about $500 a month and our mortgage is about 2200 . 

Our car insurance is about about 650 every six months. I selected the lowest coverage that we feel comfortable having.

Honestly, we haven’t done a good assessment of our expenses for food and gas and other expenses.

I think offering daycare is a phenomenal idea that I would’ve never thought of. Thank you everyone who’s responding.

personalfinance,surviving my job,"70-old parent has $9,000 in savings","Okay, I know that more should have been done to date but I am looking for advice on how to shore up the finances of an aging parent. They have minimal expenses but minimum income and not much invested

The parent is 70 years old, currently taking social security

Income: \~1000/month from SSA after Medicare is taken out

Checking+bank savings: \~$6000

Investments: $9000 in a Vanguard Roth IRA with a 2025 target date (years ago they put a 3000 in because I hounded them too)

Assets: 10-acre homestead (I am guessing it is worth over 120K) that is rented out for 700/month - basically it pays for its taxes, insurance and a little for upkeep, but not a money maker. The caretaker pays a reduced rent for mostly keeping the place up. One day I imagine my parent will sell it to pay for end-of-life care but hasn't parted with it yet. Also they have a car that is long in the tooth but all paid for.

Fortunately, they are good about living with in a budget and do not have a credit card.

Expenses:

Housing, utilities, food are covered because they live with me and my kids. They help with childcare and picking up kids from school and occasionally covers the groceries and gas for the cars.

So far medical expenses have been small (post cancer) and only has 2 prescriptions

They have no debt, but cancer wiped out their life savings 5 years ago. Survived but can no longer work a job. My understanding is that disability was not an option because they screwed up with paying social security while self-employed before cancer (something about not having enough quarters paid recently and back paying social security didn't make sense I guess).

Has a term life insurance policy that will end in 2032 and costs \~2,000 year

What are their options? What should I be thinking about as basically their ""retirement plan""

**Update:**  
I get ditching the term insurance, I think they thought that it would be helpful to me and my family  
What do I have to worry about regarding medical debts at the end? My understanding is that it does not transfer to the offspring.

**Update 2:** Thank you for all of the comments, thoughts, and advice.

1. I am looking to Elder Care resources for Ohio and will try to talk to an elder care specialist.
2. Term Life insurance:  He got it before getting cancer. My dad wants me to have the money from the term life insurance to help with the kids, especially for my special needs kiddo (he wishes he could have given us more).     I will see if I can help pick up some of the premium or try to invest that same amount of money for him. I make \~62K and have two small kids, one of which has developmental disabilities (so things are tight, but fortunately my mortgage is only $800/month). I think he did not expect to live this long especially after cancer and still thinks he will die before it is over.
3. His homestead: He also doesn't want his land to be developed. It is good farmland that has not been sprayed with pesticides in over 25 years. He wants to keep in food production for the local foodshed. The actual farmhouse is basic (1200 sqft with no AC, Solar powered, propane heaters and refrigeration). I have been helping him use his rent income to upgrade to solar system for the house and switch over to LiFe batteries from lead acid and adding more PV capacity). I guess I need to look into land trusts. Does anyone know how they work or where to start?

personalfinance,surviving my job,Would you take on 70k in student loans to change your life?,"I’m 24 and have been working and studying full-time since I was 18. I come from a low-income household; 7 of us share one bathroom, and we live in a high-crime area. I’ve managed to build six years of professional experience, but it’s in a field where salaries stay quite low unless you have highly specialised knowledge or many years of experience.

I recently got accepted into a master’s programme at a top university within a week of applying. It’s a very specific degree that aligns perfectly with my career goals. I was over the moon, but unfortunately, I didn’t get any scholarships.

Here’s the dilemma: To take up the offer, I’ll need to borrow around 70,000. This covers tuition and rent for a year in a much safer, high-income area, since commuting from my current home would be exhausting and unsafe. The loan will be a mix of private sources, and I’m fully aware of the interest rates (some are brutal, up to 30). I’d also need to work part-time or even full-time during the degree to survive, but I did that through my undergrad, so I know it’s doable.

My current job is a contract role with no benefits or long-term security. If I stay here another year to reapply or save, I risk wasting another year in a draining job with no real upward trajectory. Mentally and emotionally, this environment is costing me. I feel stuck.

The way I see it, both paths cost me something: •	Option A: Take the 70k hit, commit to moving forward, work hard, live in a better area, and maybe launch myself into a better life. •	Option B: Stay, delay, hope next year brings the same offer again (this university does not guarantee a place if you defer), and continue living in overcrowded, demoralising conditions.

Also, this programme is not one I can just replicate elsewhere. It’s highly specialised and hard to get into. I know people with stronger academic backgrounds who weren’t accepted.

I want to break this cycle, but I’m scared. 70k is a lot. I don’t have generational wealth or a financial safety net. But I also don’t want to keep playing it safe and wake up 10 years from now in the same place.

So, if you were me Would you take on the debt? Or would you wait? Any advice, practical or emotional, is welcome.

personalfinance,constantly overworked,When should a company give a company card?,"Hello, its my first time post on reddit and I am asking for advice to see if I should keep pushing my company to give me a company credit card or not.

I work as a cell phone tower technician for the past 2 years with the work primarily being on the road. This requires many flights, hotels, fuel, taxis, tools, etc.

Many of the job sites are in the Arctic or remote parts of Canada which can be quite costly.
So far this year I have $50,000 worth of expenses.

This is way more than I'm am comfortable with. I understand there are points and it can improve your credit score however it is not worth it for me. There are just too many ways this can go wrong from security, to myself or the accounting team making a mistake. Furthermore, the accounting team looks for minor details to not reimburse (I think its a power trip or something). Also, I'm already overworked so constantly auditing myself is eating away too much personal time.

Anyway, those are some of the reason I would like a company card. The amount is just way too high.

I have asked for a company card multiple times and have been rejected multiple times. I've explained my reasons and am just fed up. I've begun to look for a other jobs because they think that the money is theirs or something.

So back to the main question, in your opinion, when should a company give a company card? Is there a dollar value when it should be given or based on the education of the job?

Any feed back is great, I just am trying to see if I should keep pushing for a card.",18,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1gqtikt/when_should_a_company_give_a_company_card/,1731548145.0,Quirky_Foundation968,1gqtikt,advice_seeking
personalfinance,constantly overworked,How much money do I need to make to live comfortably?,"**Hi everyone,**

I live in Montreal, Quebec, and currently work as a freelancer. My freelance income is high (150k-$190k/year), but I work constantly and my schedule is all over the place. I’m thinking about transitioning to an in-house position because I’m really craving more balance and predictability in my life. And honestly, any down time pushes me straight into an existential crisis. I’m either overworked or spiraling.

That said, I know I'd be taking a significant pay cut if I went in-house. I've been living below my means overall, so I’m not entirely sure what salary I should aim for to maintain a comfortable lifestyle.

Here’s a breakdown of my fixed annual expenses:

* **Mortgage:** $339,657.90 principal, I pay $1,068.09 every two weeks (variable rate, currently 4.10%);
* **Condo fees:** $438.14/month (up from $422.93/month last year);
* **Special assessments:** $3,699.36 this year, $3,490.00 last year — average of \~$3,595. Both were for façade renovations, so in theory these are exceptional costs… but you never really know with condo buildings;
* **Home insurance:** $620/year;
* **Municipal taxes:** $2,969.21 this year;
* **School taxes:** Last year’s was $364.49.

That comes to a total of **\~$40,576/year** in fixed housing-related expenses.

I live alone, have no kids, and I’m not a big spender — though I do enjoy treating myself from time to time (a trip, something nice for my home, or the occasional renovation project).

Is there a good tool or rule of thumb to figure out what kind of salary I should be targeting to live comfortably (covering my bills + having room to save)?

Any suggestions or resources would be much appreciated!",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1kncis3/how_much_money_do_i_need_to_make_to_live/,1747326424.0,SizzleMoon,1kncis3,advice_seeking
personalfinance,don't know what to do with my life,Heloc is Killing me what should I do?,"So wondering if there is anyway to get in a better position.  I have a 400k mortgage at 2.5% my home is worth right around a million.  80k heloc no other debt. 100-110k yearly income.  
  I made a very mad choice a few years ago to get a heloc I finished my landscaping got solar panels and a few other odds and ends home improvements.  
  My heloc is variable apr around 7.5% it was only like 3.5 when I first got it.  Now Its everything I can do to make my minimum payment intrest only payment on the heloc.  Me and my wife both drive old paid for cars with high miles we are one emergency away from not being able to pay the bills. 
  Is there any options to lower my monthly payments?
  I thought about getting one of those 0% introductory rate credit cards and transferring as much as I get approved for from the heloc to the credit card thus lowering my heloc payment and actually paying down the principal on the credit card.  Is this a bad idea it's all I could come up with to reduce my debt.
Edit:
I have so much equity in my home because I built it myself and my father in law gave us the land so we could live next to them.

Budget: 2300 mortgage with escrow, 600 utilities, 540 heloc, 700 food and other necessities. Oh also owe 6k on student loan payment is about $100  also have cell phones, fuel, kids activities, car insurance. Income is about $6k take home.  My wife doesn't work right now because we have two year old twins and her income was about equal to what daycare would have cost she wasn't making much as a receptionist before we had the twins.
 
I would love to sell our home but we promised my father in law we would stay there next to him so I could help him on his farm. when he gave us the land. 
 I know the heloc was a dumb move but at the time I thought I could refinance my home and pay off the heloc then interests rates started going up and never stoped.  It just doesnt feel like I have any good options.  I had a second job driving a trash truck last year but I wasn't sleeping enough due to only being home 4 or 5 hours a day and fell asleep driving and got into an accident. 
Edit #2
I appreciate all the responses.   As others noted I don't know where my money is going and I don't have a real budget I just know its all spent every month.  So Im going to make a real budget with the wife.   Im going to make cuts to expenses.  Golf, home projects other non essentials.  I listed my mtn bike for sale.  I also reduced 457k contributions and Im going to start  donating plasma. That should give me more than $1000 a month to put on debt. Im gonna put the first $2000 in a savings account in case an emergency comes along.  And after that Im going to start chipping away at the heloc.   Maybe if rates go down someday I'll lock in a fixed rate second mortgage to pay replace the heloc but until then its gonna be slowly plugging along.  I think based on the comments that people are under the impression I currently am behind on payments and going to lose my house.  Thats not the case I have never had a late payment on anything in my life.  Im just stressed and overwhelmed about the mess I got myself in and paying interest only on the heloc at the moment.  But this post really got me motivated to start making progress.",507,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1lcs4cf/heloc_is_killing_me_what_should_i_do/,1750078687.0,sdan74d,1lcs4cf,advice_seeking
personalfinance,don't know what to do with my life,Would I be an idiot to leave my job right now?,"I'm a 51M with a fairly specialized set of skills that has been in high demand for the past few years. I work for the US government and if you've been following the news, you know things aren't great there right now - but my job might actually be safe. I kind of want to quit and maybe find another job, or maybe just take the summer off and reassess, or finally follow my dreams.

Here's the thing -- my whole life I've sought financial security and have never been unemployed. I have always wanted to do creative things like writing or being an entrepreneur but I stuck to the salary + benefits jobs because I wasn't willing to take the risk.

So now here I am, I have $1.55M invested between retirement and brokerage accounts, and about $90K in cash. My job pays \~185K/year and my wife makes about $95K. As of a few months ago, my plan was to work until I had $2.5M, and then retire. My expenses are around 50-60K/year so that seems like a pretty comfortable buffer.

BUT, we might be heading into the worst economy in a long time. The markets are all over the place and I don't think the 6-8% return assumption is going to apply in the near term. We might see runaway inflation. And while in normal times I'd be confident of getting a new job if I needed one, now I'd be competing with dozens of other ex-government employees with the same set of skills and we might be heading into a recession. 

tl;dr: I really want out of the 9 to 5 workforce and I'm past ready to pull the ripcord, but my gut says I should be hanging on to my job for dear life right now.

Where could one move with a $2,400 monthly income from social security?

For context, and to hopefully avoid a bunch of sarcastic answers, here's the story:

Mom and Dad are in early 60's. Dad worked in the field most of his life, migrated here when he was 8 and essentially got straight to work, so no education. Mom stayed at home most of me and my siblings lives, then began running an in home daycare for the past 10 years for a little extra income. It's a VERY small rural town, she only cares for a few kids at a time and never a big money maker but can bring in some extra few hundred from month to month. The farming company that my dad worked for about 35+ years did not offer a retirement package and due to my parents lack of education (I assume), they just never really looked into alternatives for investment. I don't think either of them even understood what investments were, until I became of age and began to talk to them about it. They basically lived paycheck to paycheck my entire life with no savings or investments.

3 years ago my dad was trying to fix something on one of those big pieces of machinery and destroyed his back. The company (not surprisingly) hired some big shot lawyer and threw him scraps off their table. He got $100k as a settlement. Since then, his body has been in decline and he had to legally wait 24 months to file for any social security benefits, so they lived off the $100k for those two years and the little bit that my mom brings in.

To add to all this, they live in California in a home they purchased in 1985. They STILL. OWE. $100k on it. I know . I know. Apparently, they re-fi'd their home years ago when they were struggling financially and got wrapped up into this f\*cked loan called the ARM loan. If you know anything about that, it should be illegal. Anyway, they don't even live in a house that they have $0 payments on after all this time. So that's about $1,500 payment.

So, my parents are in their early 60's. My dad cannot work, he's truly disabled and my mom with only a GED brings in a little extra cash some times with babysitting. They live off $2,200 a month, plus whatever little change is leftover from that shitty settlement. Mortgage is $1500, Car is $300, groceries, gas, utilities.. you do the math.

I am telling them that they need to sell the house and move to an apartment somewhere. They are sitting on an asset (maybe $500k total value, so net $400k-ish?) and there's NO way they would ever afford any repairs if something broke in the home. But with the cost of rent, I'm not even sure this is the best advice. If you were me, what would you advise them? If it's sell the house and move to a cheaper cost of living state, where would that be?

personalfinance,don't know what to do with my life,My job is making me pay $2k for job training and an unpaid internship in order to move up. Advice?,"Edit: I am OVERWHELMED by the support and helpful advice you all are showing me. I did not expect this post to get so much attention. Thank you all so much. 


For context, I am a highschool senior working as a kind of ""Kennel Tech"" (doing the cleaning, feeding, watching small groups of dogs) at a quality private dog daycare/boarding/training facility in California. I have worked there since September 2024 and I make $17.35 an hour (avg. 8 hours a week.) 

I will be graduating in June so I had a meeting with my boss to discuss more hours, availability, etc. and the topic of me moving up to a higher ""Dog Supervisor"" position (Essentially watching larger groups of dogs) came up. I said I would absolutely love to make that change and my boss told me about a program the company was planning on starting during the summer, an 8 week training course that gives you the info you need to master dog body language, behavior, etc. and hands on experience, along with an 8 week internship. He said doing the course could mean I could make $18/hr or $19/hr as a Dog Supervisor, if they decide to move me up. I did not know the price until the company put out the ad. It is about $2300 for the 8 week course and includes an 8 week unpaid internship. It has been made clear to me that I will not move up in my job if I don't pay for this course, and I still may not move up even after I do the course. He did tell me that I will get some money off for each friend I refer to the program. 

I talked to my parents about it and if I were to pay for the program, it would be completely up to me. However, I literally cannot afford to pay that much for a job course. Let alone one that does not guarantee me a job. The cost of the program is my entire income from last year. We are a low income family and I pay for my own expenses, including gas, groceries, etc. I talked to some friends about the program, and all but one said they could not afford to pay for something like that and that it isn't right to have someone essentially pay to do volunteer work. I sent him a message saying I was concerned because I cannot afford to pay for the program, and mentioned how typically, jobs don't require you to pay for training, and he asked me to come in on my off day for a short meeting. The meeting started off with him and his partner telling me that I was wrong and confused, and basically that the program is a one of a kind opportunity to get a certification and look better on a resume. He also told me that good jobs require you to pay for training all the time, ""like how a hairdresser has to pay to go to school for haircutting."" I felt kind of attacked and embarrassed and went along with it in the moment, and apologized for using the words ""volunteer"" and such. They then asked me what I can pay for the program and I told them I really can't say an amount. They insisted that if I refer people it will lower the amount and that it would make it more affordable, and they would be willing to work with me. I ended up asking if I could just stay in my current position for now. They were very accepting of that part and it made me feel better in the moment, but the more I think about it, the more uncomfortable and anxious I feel. I really can't afford to stay in my current position/wage much longer but I don't think I should pay for the program. 

I did some googling about the situation after being told how wrong it was by friends, adults in my life, etc. and from what I have found, requiring someone to pay for job training/to move up is not legal. I have no idea what to do about this but I love my team and my job (most of the time) and am hoping to get some helpful feedback. Is this normal? Is it crazy? Please help.

personalfinance,don't know what to do with my life,"Roommate is underwater on debt, just lost a big chunk of income she relied on, can't make house payments","So I live with a college friend who has made some...questionable financial choices. When I first moved in, she was making $15/hr and she bought a $440k house. Her dad was getting social security payments, and they had an okay sized trust from her grandmother passing away. Essentially my role was to make up the remainder they needed to pay the mortgage, which I was okay with initially because I assumed her and I would both get better paying jobs. Her dad was paying about $1200 a month, they took $900 a month from the trust, I (initially) was paying $750 a month, which left her to pay $550 on the \~$3400 a month for mortgage, utilities, maintenance, etcetera.

Recently, her dad passed away, and the state took what little remained of the trust to cover his end-of-life medical care so there went $2100 a month. While my roommate did get a raise to $19.50/hr, she has financed two elective surgeries (Lasik and a tummy tuck after major weightloss), taken out a personal loan (not sure for what), has a few thousand in credit card debt, owes the HOA $1000 (fines/late fees she has ignored), and a contractor another $2500, and no savings, but shockingly has maintained a 720 credit score (as far as I know, she could've lied I suppose). I made her sit down and do her finances a few months ago and before the Lasik but after the tummy tuck she had $900 a month after *only* her personal bills were factored out and not the mortgage or other house bills, which is insane. Add in the Lasik and it's even less, but I don't know exactly what.

I'm in a position where I *could* absolutely pay the mortgage, but considering her financial choices (and some personal issues that have soured our relationship), I don't see any good reason why I should pay for her to keep her house. I'm trying to help her in any other way I can, however

She is currently looking at her options, but my fear is she won't do what I believe to be the right thing which is sell the house and start living more within her means. She is considering a home equity loan. Correct me if I'm wrong, but would a home equity loan be an okay idea just to buy time to prepare to move out? Like allow her to get a more affordable apartment, then sell the house and the whole thing ends up just a complete wash? I believe the house has increased in value \~$30k and she's paid roughly $80k toward the mortgage. If it's a bad idea, what other options might she have?

Edit: Thanks for all the replies! Way more than I expected. I should clear up a few things I left out by accident or plain don't know. The trust is in her father's name, not hers, that's how the state took it. They're not touching the house because, and this is just what I was told, Medicaid was never involved, her dad passed before they needed to pay for his care and before that was in and out of the hospital/rehab. I have zero idea how she got the house and frankly, now that you're all mentioning it I feel like an idiot, that should've been a major and immediate red flag but I completely tuned it out somehow. I *think* both her and her dad signed for it but that's still...questionable. I guess it doesn't matter now. As for actually paying her mortgage, there's a reason I put ""I'm trying to help her in any other way"", I have zero intention of paying it. This post was just on the off chance there was some Hail Mary she could do, but I wasn't going to hold my breath. Additional roommates is very unlikely to happen. Part of what soured our friendship is her inability/unwillingness to address several aspects of proper housekeeping. I've put up with it out of a severe case of ""bleeding heart syndrome"", the likelihood of anyone else putting up with it is very, very low. And yes, I have been told repeatedly I need to get out immediately, but I'm stupidly holding out hope my roommate gets her feces cohesive and properly addresses things.

We have a lease of sorts. She wanted it to be just an informal, verbal agreement, I refused. I looked up just a generic rental agreement for a month to month agreement, with a yearly increase in rent determined after a review of home specific finances and in line with inflation, and I can leave at any time provided I give 2 months notice. I'm fairly certain she doesn't even remember it or have the copy I gave her. But I am currently packing my things, I definitely can't stay, regardless of whatever happens.",1014,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1h8botb/roommate_is_underwater_on_debt_just_lost_a_big/,1733519016.0,Chilichunks,1h8botb,advice_seeking

**EDIT:**

First off, thanks to everyone who replied.  I read just about every reply here and a lot of them were very helpful.  A few things

1. The messages I got from Huntington Fraud did specifically mention it was my card being used and every time it's happened it's been the new card.  I don't know how much of a difference this makes but I've seen some suggest it's my account number rather than my card that was compromised.  It could be, but they're using the card still.  I wasn't just going through my account and noticing weird charges.  They caught them.
2. I don't have an SO or live with anyone.  Furthermore, and I should have mentioned this, but it's always someone way out of my state that uses it and buys weird shit like $50 worth of McDonalds Coffee from Office Depot.  So I'm sure it's no one around me that's getting a hold of my card.
3. I didn't mean to throw shade at the bank teller who said they didn't know how the card was being compromised.  While I understand she wouldn't know how my card specifically was being used, I just thought she might have some information on how to protect myself.  She told me about the card skimmers though and that was certainly insightful.  I had no idea what they were before then and now I know what to look for.  My mom was a bank teller for many MANY years in her life, and believe me, I know they deal with stupid people a lot.  My favorite story she told me was about the guy who came up angry that he was overdrawn and then proceeded to say that was impossible because he ""still had checks left.""  So i guess I was the stupid person this time.
4. To everyone saying ""Why is OP using a debit card??!!?!!?!?!! This makes no sense.  Everyone knows you never use a debit card and only use credit!!111!"" and acting like I'm a moron... well, growing up in the 80s before debit cards were a common thing, I was always told that credit cards were for emergencies only and you should only use it if you need to.  That has stuck with me but I see now that things have changed and using a credit card is the better option.  And it makes a lot of sense too.

And I know I'm going to get a bunch of replies now that say ""I grew up in the 80s and never used a debit card in my entire life!!!?????!"" but at least where I grew up, credit cards were emergencies only because of interest and the fact that it was easy to rack up debt with them.  But as I said, things have changed. Just try to understand that maybe someone was taught something different and that doesn't mean they're stupid.

Most people I know has had their card compromised at least once in their life, that's why I said ""it happens sometimes.""  If it hasn't happened to you... well that's great.  I hope it doesn't happen to you.  I'm 43 now but I was 42 when this happened and i went that long with it only ever happening one other time 10 years ago so... I'd say I had a good run. I've heard of it happening to people who haven't even activated their card yet so... sometimes weird shit happens.

Also with the invention of chip cards, they were supposed to be insanely secure and you just tap and go and no information is sent.  I never swipe my card, I only ever use chip and that was supposed to be the way to go.  You hear that all these things are secure and you can trust this and that and only do it this or that way, and sometimes it's hard to tell what's really secure and what isn't.

5.  To people saying ""Stop using your debit card everywhere!""... I'm being honest when I say that the latest card I got I barely used.  I never entered it anywhere online or on my phone and never swiped it anywhere and changed my pin and everything.  So, I'm really at a loss as to how someone was able to use it.  My best guess is the auto update thing.

6.

A.  I will be closing down my bank accounts and opening new ones.

B.  I will keep my debit card locked unless I need to use it for withdrawals.  I'll use my credit card and pay it off once a week now and keep an eye on it.

C.  I have a password manager now and I'm in the process of changing all my passwords and enable 2FA on everything

D.  I would like to check my computer for malware and would like suggestions on the best one to use.  I want to check my phone too but I've never entered my card information on my phone.

And I think that's about it.  If it happens again, I will change banks.  I just don't want to do that now since I've been with Huntington for so long and they've always caught the fraud charges right away and reversed the charges.  I'm worried that if I go to a new bank it won't be as easy but hopefully it just doesn't happen anymore.

Again, thanks for all the replies.  I appreciate all the help and will do everything I can to make sure this doesn't happen anymore.

Original post:

So hi there r/personalfinance  redditors.  I'm not 100% certain if this is the correct subreddit to post to but when I looked up information on what I was going through, this subreddit came up a lot.

First off, I know everyone probably says this but I do consider myself careful with bank cards.  I very rarely if at all use them online.  I usually pay with paypal.  If I do use a bank card, I don't have google auto save it, but again, usually I don't.  I only ever use tap as well.  I don't swipe my card anywhere.

So back in June, my bank card was compromised.  Huntington caught it right away and put a stop on it.  Not a big deal to me, it happens to everyone, although the last time it happened it was like 10 years ago.

I got a new card but then two months later, again, charges on the card that I didn't do.  I stopped the card again and this time when I went into Huntington I asked them how that could be.  It seemed crazy to me that my card could be compromised twice in a short period of time.  The lady there told me it could be a card skimmer at a gas station nearby.  She also says she sees this happens sometimes where someone will have their card hacked several time in a short amount of time and they don't know why.

I got a new card and this time I was careful.  I didn't even activate it for like two weeks because now I was nervous.  When I did activate, I didn't use it much as I used to.  I either paid cash or used my credit card.  When I did use the bank card, again, I would tap, never swipe.  I even examined the gas stations i went to to see if there were skimmers, but found none.

Then last week, once again, charges on the card that weren't mine.  I also got an email about an order someone placed on officedepot using my email address.  (it was a bunch of coffee so I guess this person is tired)

At this point I was just completely at a loss and didn't know what to do.  I thought to myself that i wouldn't even bother getting a new one, BUT I took to the internet anyway to look up why this could happen.

I came across two things

1. Skimmers.  It could be a skimmer somewhere or....
2. Apparently if a website with your card information is breached, it's easy for them to get the new card information when you get it.

Neither of these made sense to me and I couldn't figure out which website could have the card info until now.  I was going through old emails and I found one I missed from Ticketmaster...

yes, I had used them and put my card information in.  I went to the Sonic Symphony this year.  I'm sure that's how they got my name, email and card number and such.

But, the thing is... I don't know how to fix this.  I don't want to just not have a bank card, just in case but I don't want to have to change it every 2 months.... so my plan was to close my bank accounts and open new ones with a new email address.

Will that be enough?  Is there something else I need to do?  Sorry for the long post, I guess I got a little carried away but I wanted to lay all the facts out.  Let me know, thanks.",596,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1fwjxqy/my_bank_card_is_repeatedly_compromised_i_think_i/,1728108710.0,Dashaque,1fwjxqy,advice_seeking
personalfinance,don't know what to do with my life,Low income ($23k net) but got a $60k bonus. What would you suggest I do?,"I (28yr old dude) work part time for a small business in Southern California, and also help the owners with their personal bookkeeping. I'm pretty much their all-around guy. Owners are married and own the S-Corp. One of their parents died, and they recieved a $360k non qualified annuity which they decided to pull out as a lump sum. Not wanting to pay high taxes, they did a lot of stuff, including put some money into the S-Corp and gave me a bonus of $60,000. Their accountant encouraged this and I was totally speechless. They like me a lot, and want me to stick around helping them with the business and their personal lives until their deaths. Theyre in their 70's. The bonus was sort of a retainer for keeping me around and a way for them to write off the losses in their business and have it carryover into their personal.

That's the backstory for how someone who has lived with no savings or investments has suddenly come up on a huge sum of cash, and has no idea what to do next.

Things I understand:

\- Big chunk will go to taxes as withholdings, I already anticipate this, and until I get a solid number from a tax professional, I'm ready to send off $40k for withholdings. Side note: They wrote me a check instead of doing it through our payroll processor, and so now I have to have fun trying to send that money to the Fed and State on my own...

\- I should put some of it into a HYSA

\- Maybe try to open up a trad. IRA before tax day (hoping this would help reduce my taxes on this while also putting the money somewhere safe)

\- invest some of it? this is the part I know less about, and don't really anticipate becoming an investment/stocks head. However I know there are options for me to have someone else handle those decisions.

I have no debt at all, I rent an apartment with my GF (we each pay $990/mo), I'm not super spendy. I would like to advance my life with this money, but have never learned or needed to learn about how having money makes you more money. Any advice?

edit: i have no debt at all. I will be making more like $48k/yr next year at the same job, maybe even more.

Edit: I would like to own a house eventually, sounds like i'll need more money before I can even make a move towards that. thoughts?",604,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1hls50s/low_income_23k_net_but_got_a_60k_bonus_what_would/,1735094462.0,crazylife100,1hls50s,advice_seeking

edit 2:  
  
I'm a bit overwhelmed by all of the responses, and I've done my best to read all of them.

From what I've gathered ; leaving most of it in a HYSA account is enough for now while I complete college.

Regain employment and save my checks. With my last job, I saved whatever was left of my check after 375. That covered transport, my phone bill and the internet. Currently, I am not paying rent as my family is gracious. However, once I get employed, this will change as I'm not a freeloader. I saved about 1k which I have unfortunately spent on insurance copays on a recent injury, but hey, can't do anything about it.

I need to research into IRA's and other retirement accounts, lock away a decent portion of that money for later. This seems to be the general consensus. 

If I'm serious about investing, I should consult with a financial advisor and allow a professional to handle it.

General questions:

\- Would it be worth taking out 1-5k and trying to invest that in dividends? From what I understand, they pay you quarterly, which you can compound into more stocks.

\- Should I split the 30k between the HYSA and the retirement account?

personalfinance,career change at 30/40,How far financially would my partner getting a PhD and me going to law school at the same time set us back?,"We both recently turned 24 and are two years post grad. We live together in a HCOL city. I'm making $120k/year and he's making $400k/year (but will drop down to $350k next year due to having a sign on bonus this year). I have $210k in savings (\~25k is locked in a 401k) and he has $150k in savings (\~45k is locked in a 401k). So combined, we have about \~$300k in savings (minus the retirement accounts). I think combined, we save \~$10-12k/month. We're moderate spenders.

90% of our money is invested (split between index funds/ETFs and individual stocks). We each have $10k in an emergency fund.

I am planning on attending law school from Fall 2026 - 2029. My income likely won't change more than $10k in the next year. Depending on if his company IPOs in the next 1-2 years, his income could skyrocket due to equity. We're not banking on this even though it's likely. We'll probably save an additional \~100k before Fall of next year.

For the entire three years of law school, I will probably be making $40-50k over the summer as an intern. My parents will pay for law school.

My boyfriend really wants to get a PhD in Computer Science or Math while I'm in law school (and while he's still in his 20s). He'd probably go a year after I start law school (so in 2027). For those four years, he'd probably make $50-80k/year. He's doesn't really want the PhD for career reasons, just for passion reasons.

After law school, I'd ideally work in big law and be making \~$250k/year and after his PhD, he'll likely be making double what he makes now so we'd be very high earners. But he could still get to making $600-$800k in the next five years without a PhD just by climbing the ladder.

Our goals are to buy a house (likely >$1 mil) in our HCOL area before we're 30. We also want to get married before we're 30 (ideally 28/29). And we still want to have big budget vacations every year.

I’m starting to feel desperate because of my mental health and stress levels from my W-2.



**TL;DR:**

* $1.3M in Retirement (401k+IRA)

* $39k/year from rental property investments; Total equity/value of $980k
* “Ramen” expenses of $59k/year; “Ideal” expenses of $83k/year - includes $18k/year in child support until 2029, but excluding insurance.
* Want to “retire” early without selling rental properties - considering using SEPP 72(t) to supplement rental income.
* If needed, may also switch careers or work part-time; after youngest child goes to college in 5 years, will probably move to a more affordable country for 10-15 years.



**Financial Situation (August 2024):**

* **W-2 Income:** 
   * About **$210k/year** gross including commissions
* **401k** (just recently lowered contributions from maxing out to 6% with 4% match to try to start building up cash)
   * Traditional: **$217k** (Vanguard Target Retirement 2035)
   * Roth: **$76k** (Vanguard Target Retirement 2035) 
* **IRA**
   * Traditional: **$430k** (Vanguard Target Retirement 2035)
   * Roth: **$620k** (Vanguard Target Retirement 2045 - yes 2045)
* **5 Rental Properties** 
   * Total cash flow (after paying P&I and all estimated expenses) **$27k/year**
   * Total current equity **$680k**
   * Mortgage rates all 2.5% - 4% - so don’t want to pay them off, and too low to refinance maybe forever
* **Fractional Rental Investment**
   * Estimate value about **$300k**
   * Cash flowing about only **$12k/year** 
* **Groundfloor**
   * **$15k** invested, getting about 12% annual return so far - but trying to cash out instead of reinvest to build up cash
* **Assume:**
   * No debt outside of mortgages on rental properties 
      * In the process of moving my primary house, and expect to pay off that loan in 2025 after selling current primary
   * No other bank assets
      * Purchasing my new primary house and paying it off within 2025 will be emptying my bank accounts
      * Not counting the 529 accounts I have for my kids
* **Expenses:**
   * **Minimal: $59k/year** (includes many “estimated expenses” - utilities, repairs, maintenance - in today’s dollars)
   * **Ideal: $83k/year** (includes “fun” money like travel and activities)
   * Both INCLUDES **$18k/year** child support until **2029**
   * NEITHER INCLUDES **INSURANCE** (i.e. $12k/year through ACA)



I wished I had put more effort into a mid-term savings (i.e. Taxable Brokerage with VTI) for early retirement, but I had concentrated “too much” on retirement/401k/IRA.

I do think Target Retirement 2035 is too conservative - I feel like they should be 2055 for Roth and 2045 for Traditional because I’ll probably start dipping into Traditional first, and change balance to 60/40 like LifeStrategy Moderate Growth during retirement.



**Current Personal Situation:**

* **Personal life:** Recently divorced, which exhausted me mentally/emotionally; terrified of ever being in a relationship again (yes I went through therapy)
* **Career:** After the divorce, I’m truly exhausted and struggling with the stress that comes with it; I need a lot of breaks - can’t concentrate much - and not motivated anymore.
* **Family:** 3 Kids - two still in middle/high school, one in college; Parents starting to have health issues - I want to spend a lot more quality time with all of them



**My Thoughts/Options MOVING FORWARD:**

* TRY to not sell off rental properties - to TRY to live off of their cash flows plus other sources of income (see below)
* Potentially use SEPP 72(t) to cover expenses that aren’t covered by Rental Cash flow
* Ideally not have to work - but if I “have to” work, career switch to become a real estate agent (more fun for me) and get insurance through ACA; “Worst case” go work at Costco or Home Depot part-time (30+ hours) and get insurance but what I don’t like about this is I won’t be flexible hours to allow me to go see my kids school and after-school activities during the week
* After youngest child goes to college (in 5 years), strongly considering moving to a more affordable country for 10-15 years (Costa Rica?), then move back to the US.
* After paying off (new) primary home in 2025, would get a HELOC lined up for any potential rental property investments to try to increase cash flow
* Trying to build up a combination of VTI and VYM in a taxable brokerage account 

* Open to other ideas I have not thought about

personalfinance,career change at 30/40,Can I afford to take a break or downsize my work? ,"Throwaway Account

Hi everyone, 

I’ve been a long time reader and want to first thank you all for the advice and knowledge I’ve gained ever since following this sub. I’d really appreciate any feedback on my progress and advice y’all have to offer.

I apologize for the lengthy post, but I could really use your help and wanted to give you as much information as possible.

I grew up in a small rural town in the Midwest. After college I moved to Austin for better work options and the weather. I enjoy Austin and have made some great friends here, but all of my family is back in my home state. The past 10 years or so I’ve really struggled with wanting to move closer to family.

My dad passed away about 8 years ago. My mom is still living and in good health, but after a recent visit I noticed she is starting to slow down. Not as confident driving, using hand rails more often, taking stairs one at a time, etc. She turns 80 next year. She and I are very close and I’ve long thought of retiring early and moving closer to her and the rest of my family, but now I’m contemplating pulling the plug and just moving back next year. I’m fortunate to have a well paying job, and doubt I’ll make this much money should I move back. I’m concerned that if I do not make a bold move and go, I’ll never return or I’ll return when mom is really in need of assistance or falls ill. I know I would regret waiting too long. In my mind Austin will always be here, but sadly my mom won’t.

I’ve always been somewhat of a saver, but didn’t get really serious about it until about 13 years ago when I read about the FIRE movement. I would love an early retirement. I’ve had good paying jobs, but didn’t cross the 6 figure income mark until 2015/2016. I’m now making more money than I ever have, which makes it even more difficult to walk away from. At minimum I’m trying to stay at my current job until mid February when I will get my next chunk of RSU’s. The amount I get in February is the largest of the tranches. Approx $30-$40k after taxes depending on stock price. I honestly am not sure if I can hold out that long though.

Long term I’ve always planned on moving home. I’m not so much worried about the adjustment in lifestyle/income as I am sabotaging retirement. If I pulled the plug without having a job lined up I could stay with my mom and I am not too proud to take lower paying jobs until something more permanent that I enjoy comes around.

Another thing that is pushing me is my current job. I’m pretty miserable in my current role and I just can’t see myself in the role much longer. At the same time I’m so burned out I don’t know what else to do. Every job description sounds like what I’m trying to escape. I’d be willing to look for another job here, but think that would lock me into Austin for at least another couple of years and I’d still be away from my family. I wouldn’t be against it, but really feel like I need to just take a break and clear my head. I admit I’m not one who takes great care of my mental health, and I’m probably paying the price for that now.

**TLDR:** I have a good paying job in tech (finance/operations side) but am contemplating leaving to move closer to family. My current job is very demanding, draining and I have thought about scaling back. The work/life balance is really poor and the environment is borderline toxic. I’m burned out and to the point where I dread going to work and am thinking I might like to change fields all together. I just don’t have the passion for business anymore. I have a few great friends here, but we don’t get together all that often as they moved to the burbs and have families. This move would be from Austin to the midwest. I don’t want to derail retirement and plan to still contribute as much as I can afford. Would love to retire early (mid/late 50s) if possible. I need to work at least 5 more years so that I have 35 years of employment to count for Social Security. I realize I will likely need to work more than 5 years in order to retire comfortably. I’ve also considered just taking some time off. Moving in with my mom (to minimize costs although I would be chipping in as much as I can afford and would likely get a part time job or something to keep a stream of income), get over this burnout, and finding something I like better even if it means going back to school.  I need some kind of change though as I feel pretty unhappy, don’t want to continue the career path that I’m on (boss works 14 hour days 6 days a week), and I miss my family a lot. I enjoy Austin, but it’s become very crowded and expensive. I’ve long dreamed about eventually living somewhere with a lower cost of living, I grew up in a rural area. My previous job was remote and I was able to spend my summers with my family. Unfortunately I was impacted by a corporate downsizing, fortunately I was scooped up by my current employer after a couple of months of being unemployed. Current job was supposed to be that I would go to the office 1 day a month. Company policy changed about 2 months after I was hired. Now I really only get to see my family at Christmas, and I hate that. In the past few weeks I’ve had what I believe to be anxiety or panic attacks that are likely caused by my current mental state, work, and struggling with this decision. I took a week off of work 2 weeks ago to see my family and like every time I visit I didn’t want to leave. Like crying didn’t want to leave. As soon as I went back to work, all of the stress and anxiety came back as if I hadn’t taken any time off. 

I yearn for a decent simple life closer to family. Careerwise I’m not really passionate about anything anymore. I don’t need to be rich, just need to be able to keep the lights on and save for retirement.

**Questions:**

Am I crazy for considering this? 

How bad would the impact to my retirement be? (Thinking more about long term retirement. I don’t mind working longer if needed and I enjoy the work. Ability to retire early would just be a bonus.)

What other things should I consider? 

Overall how’s my progress? Somedays I think I’ve done well, other days I feel behind.

I realize it’s my decision, but what would you do in my situation?

How should I better prepare for being jobless if that happens? Should I start putting more money in cash and less in the Mega Back Door Roth 401k?

Is this just a mid-life crisis?

Any other advice is appreciated. 

**Stats:**

45 year old male

Single, never married, no children, no pets (dog passed earlier this year)

Bachelors and Masters degree in business

Annual gross salary: $150,000.00

Annual gross bonus: $15,000 but could be up to $25,000 depending on company performance. Paid in February

RSUs Unvested: $206,094.00 (4 year vesting schedule, most in January, some in August)

ESPP - Invest 15%. Receive the stocks every 6 months with a 15% discount based on the average price over the 6 month period. Pays out in May and November.

Counting ESPP, bonus, and RSU grants I project to gross about $223k this year.

**Annual Savings:**

ESPP: Put in full 15%. Holding for LTCG then will sell and reinvest.

RSUs: Holding for now (inside trader list) but will eventually sell and reinvest.

Traditional 401k: $23,000 (max) not including 50% of first 6% company match

Mega Back Door Roth 401k: $14,000 (I put in as much as I can afford)

IRA - Typically max out, but will likely stop and instead put the full amount I can contribute into the Mega Back Door Roth 401k.

HSA - max (company contributes $600)

I target to save at least 40% of total income for retirement. (I count RSU and ESPP holdings as savings)

**Cash and equivalents:**

Capital One HYSA/Checking - $57,000 (I like to keep about 1 year of expenses in cash. This I consider my emergency fund but will use some for purchases if needed as long as the balance doesn’t go below $35-$40k)

CD - 5% - $200,000.00 matures next year. (I debated listing this. This was a gift from my mom  for a house. My parents helped my brother and his wife with their home over the years and she wants everything to be equal so she gifted this to me a few months ago. I have no plans to buy a house now, we agreed to put it into a 1 year 5% CD with her has the primary holder and I as the secondary. She insisted that she pay the taxes until I decide what I want to do with it. So far I exclude this from my retirement calc since this was unplanned. I’m incredibly fortunate, grateful, and still a bit shocked. Decided to lock it up for a year so I can think about the best use for this money)

**Assets:**

**Debt: $3,400**

Normal monthly expenses on credit cards that are paid off each month. It's a bit higher this month due to a recent trip back home.

**Health:**

Good overall health. I take high blood pressure meds, and wear contact lenses. I currently have over a year's supply of lenses on hand. I think with a less stressful job I could get off the meds. I love working out, but have no time/energy now to develop a good routine. Diet would also likely be better since I'm a stress eater.

**Notes:**

\*Target investment mix is 60/20/20 although current allocation has drifted more to 65/20/15. I rebalance only if there is a 10% deviation from the target mix. I try to rebalance with new money. I do not take individual brokerages in account except for the 3 fund portfolio when determining the need to rebalance. I realize I probably should. I avoid fixed income investments in Roth accounts as best I can as I want that money to have the highest growth potential.

\*I front-load my 401k. I invest 50%+ of my paycheck into the traditional 401k until I only need to put enough in to get the full company match (they match 50% of my 6% contribution) for the rest of the year and still max out. Then I set my contribution to 6% and increase the contributions to the Mega Back Door Roth 401k. After front-loading my take home is around $2500 every 2 weeks. I sometimes get a small monetary gift from my mom at Christmas in lieu of presents. If needed I sell RSU/ESPP shares to subsidize living expenses while front loading, but I rarely need to do that.

\*Will eventually roll over old employer 401k into existing Roth/Traditional IRA.

\*Cash position used to be higher, but my dog got sick. It cost approximately $20k for his treatments/surgeries. I saved a separate fund for him and any potential health issues since I elected not to get pet insurance. I’m very happy I was able to provide him what he needed and not be too stressed about the money. I’m slowly rebuilding that to try and get back to around $60k-$65k, but really trying to focus on maximizing investments especially now that I have access to a Mega Back Door Roth 401K.

\*Planning on using the HSA for insurance/healthcare costs in retirement.

\*If I move my cost of living would likely decrease, but budgeting for it to be around the same just to be safe. Not sure what my salary in any new position would look like. 

\*According to Personal Capital, expenses have averaged around $75,000 a year the past 6 years. This is bit high as some of the expenses were work related or things I’d buy for my friends/family where I was reimbursed. When I used to track expenses closely my expenses were about $60,000 - $65,000 a year. My spending habits have not changed much from then. Rent is around $2400 a month and included in that total. I realize that rent is a lot relative to my take home pay, but I love my apartment and have no debt so I’m ok with it for now. I do eat out too much now, but really enjoy cooking and know I could (and have) live on less.

\*My goal is to save enough to have $80k-$100k a year (Thinking $2.5 million) in retirement. Hoping I won’t need to spend that much.

\*Again so sorry for the long post. Generally I'm a very private person so this was difficult to post, but I feel really stuck and could use your advice. I appreciate you all!

personalfinance,career change at 30/40,Need Advice for Current Situation....Stay or Leave Current Job/City...Take a Break From Work,"Throwaway Account

Hi everyone, 

I’ve been a long time reader and want to first thank you all for the advice and knowledge I’ve gained ever since following this sub. I’d really appreciate any feedback on my progress and advice y’all have to offer.

I apologize for the lengthy post, but I could really use your help and wanted to give you as much information as possible.

I grew up in a small rural town in the Midwest. After college I moved to Austin for better work options and the weather. I enjoy Austin and have made some great friends here, but all of my family is back in my home state. The past 10 years or so I’ve really struggled with wanting to move closer to family.

My dad passed away about 8 years ago. My mom is still living and in good health, but after a recent visit I noticed she is starting to slow down. Not as confident driving, using hand rails more often, taking stairs one at a time, etc. She turns 80 next year. She and I are very close and I’ve long thought of retiring early and moving closer to her and the rest of my family, but now I’m contemplating pulling the plug and just moving back next year. I’m fortunate to have a well paying job, and doubt I’ll make this much money should I move back. I’m concerned that if I do not make a bold move and go, I’ll never return or I’ll return when mom is really in need of assistance or falls ill. I know I would regret waiting too long. In my mind Austin will always be here, but sadly my mom won’t.

I’ve always been somewhat of a saver, but didn’t get really serious about it until about 13 years ago when I read about the FIRE movement. I would love an early retirement. I’ve had good paying jobs, but didn’t cross the 6 figure income mark until 2015/2016. I’m now making more money than I ever have, which makes it even more difficult to walk away from. At minimum I’m trying to stay at my current job until mid February when I will get my next chunk of RSU’s. The amount I get in February is the largest of the tranches. Approx $30-$40k after taxes depending on stock price. I honestly am not sure if I can hold out that long though.

Long term I’ve always planned on moving home. I’m not so much worried about the adjustment in lifestyle/income as I am sabotaging retirement. If I pulled the plug without having a job lined up I could stay with my mom and I am not too proud to take lower paying jobs until something more permanent that I enjoy comes around.

Another thing that is pushing me is my current job. I’m pretty miserable in my current role and I just can’t see myself in the role much longer. At the same time I’m so burned out I don’t know what else to do. Every job description sounds like what I’m trying to escape. I’d be willing to look for another job here, but think that would lock me into Austin for at least another couple of years and I’d still be away from my family. I wouldn’t be against it, but really feel like I need to just take a break and clear my head. I admit I’m not one who takes great care of my mental health, and I’m probably paying the price for that now.



**TLDR:** I have a good paying job in tech (finance/operations side) but am contemplating leaving to move closer to family. My current job is very demanding, draining and I have thought about scaling back. The work/life balance is really poor and the environment is borderline toxic. I’m burned out and to the point where I dread going to work and am thinking I might like to change fields all together. I just don’t have the passion for business anymore. I have a few great friends here, but we don’t get together all that often as they moved to the burbs and have families. This move would be from Austin to the midwest. I don’t want to derail retirement and plan to still contribute as much as I can afford. Would love to retire early (mid/late 50s) if possible. I need to work at least 5 more years so that I have 35 years of employment to count for Social Security. I realize I will likely need to work more than 5 years in order to retire comfortably. I’ve also considered just taking some time off. Moving in with my mom (to minimize costs although I would be chipping in as much as I can afford and would likely get a part time job or something to keep a stream of income), get over this burnout, and finding something I like better even if it means going back to school.  I need some kind of change though as I feel pretty unhappy, don’t want to continue the career path that I’m on (boss works 14 hour days 6 days a week), and I miss my family a lot. I enjoy Austin, but it’s become very crowded and expensive. I’ve long dreamed about eventually living somewhere with a lower cost of living, I grew up in a rural area. My previous job was remote and I was able to spend my summers with my family. Unfortunately I was impacted by a corporate downsizing, fortunately I was scooped up by my current employer after a couple of months of being unemployed. Current job was supposed to be that I would go to the office 1 day a month. Company policy changed about 2 months after I was hired. Now I really only get to see my family at Christmas, and I hate that. In the past few weeks I’ve had what I believe to be anxiety or panic attacks that are likely caused by my current mental state, work, and struggling with this decision. I took a week off of work 2 weeks ago to see my family and like every time I visit I didn’t want to leave. Like crying didn’t want to leave. As soon as I went back to work, all of the stress and anxiety came back as if I hadn’t taken any time off. 

I yearn for a decent simple life closer to family. Careerwise I’m not really passionate about anything anymore. I don’t need to be rich, just need to be able to keep the lights on and save for retirement.



**Questions:**

Am I crazy for considering this? 

How bad would the impact to my retirement be? (Thinking more about long term retirement. I don’t mind working longer if needed and I enjoy the work. Ability to retire early would just be a bonus.)

Only upcoming major purchases I can think of are a new mattress and possibly a new couch as mine are pretty old and starting to get uncomfortable. I might also spring for a new computer as mine is 7 years old and starting to slow down a bit. I imagine the move might cost $5k or so. I don’t have a lot of stuff, but do have some things that will have to be shipped or transported by movers. If I live with my mom for a while I could put my things in storage and move them later.

personalfinance,career change at 30/40,Should I quit my job and finish school?,"So I have been going back and forth with this for a few weeks and I don’t know what to do. 

Currently I (29 year old male) am a .75 employee (30 hrs /wk) but I consistently hit 40 working for a city government outside of Seattle. There has been talks for a few months with my union about shifting my position to full time. So right now I believe I’m making right around 66k a year and if the union rumors are true and I get bumped to 40/hrs (with a title change) my pay would be right around 82k. 

I don’t think this is the job I want to do forever, but I do not have a degree and I feel very lucky to have this job, but also trapped because I don’t have the experience to do something else. 

I have been taking night classes to start a marketing/entrepreneurial bachelors degree at a local community college and the bachelor cohort becomes full time in January and will go for a year and a half and the hours will not work with my current job. 

I have connections in the marketing world across a few different industries, by no means do I have a job lined up, but it’s also not a completely foreign world to me. 

I guess I am wondering if going back to school will be worth the investment, or if the job market is too competitive and I should just stay where I am or just anything I might not be thinking about. 

For added context: I live with my girlfriend and we rent from her parents who are willing to suspend our rent payment if we are both in school - so we would just need part time jobs to cover basics like food/utilities.

personalfinance,career change at 30/40,LCOL area to a HCOL area for School. How to prepare?,"Hello all,

Just want to put out my situation out there and hoping to get some feedback. 

My fiance and I are dentists currently living in a LCOL area. She brings in $150k and I bring in $400k. We will be moving to a HCOL area for her residency next June and anticipate a lot of changes.

1. Tuition for residency is going to be about $100k per year for 2 years. And anticipated grad student loan interest rates are 9%.

2. I will be taking about a 30-40% pay cut. I may not make as much money as I am right now and likely will go down closer to $300k. I just happen to work in a very high paying area for my specialty.

3. We were hoping to have a wedding prior to residency but it looks like we may have to push it back 6-12 months.

These were the things I'd like to ask about:

  
1. Despite our high incomes, we have only just started our careers (9 months) so we don't have much in savings and investments. We have $50k in emergency funds and about $50k combined in savings. We anticipate that there will be large costs in the next few years (wedding, potential house, potential office buyout opportunity) but have been lucky enough to have my fiance max out our 401k for now (I don't have a 401k opportunity). In the next year that we have left, should we be stockpiling more into savings to potentially not take out any student loans? May not be able to max out 401k in this scenario.

  
2. Once my fiance finishes her residency in 2 years, her anticipated income will be $300-500k assuming she works full time and depending on where she works. Are we making enough that we shouldn't be too worried about a 9% loan?

  
I apologize in advance if this sounds super calloused. I mean no disrespect and just hoping to get some perspective. Thank you.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1f0p60m/lcol_area_to_a_hcol_area_for_school_how_to_prepare/,1724563824.0,Worth_Wallaby1961,1f0p60m,advice_seeking
personalfinance,career change at 30/40,Terrified of money and fear spending money on anything.,"Recently divorced 40-year-old with an income of about $100k/year. Sold property I owned with my ex in February and have been sitting on most of the money from settlement in a high-yield savings account. Divorce was not expensive for us as there were no children involved and we were somewhat amiable about splitting possessions. Moved back home with parents after sale with the intention of buying another house but something failed at the last minute before settlement. Shortly afterwards, my Dad passed away and I'd rather stay with Mom for the time being. I contribute money towards the household, not necessarily in rent.

  
So here I am with decent income, money saved in emergency account, no rent, no car payment, no alimony, only some student loan and tax debt, no credit card debt, the most amount I've ever had in a bank account, some retirement savings, etc and I absolutely FEAR spending money every day. I seem to hate spending money on anything. $9 margarita? Too expensive. Need winter clothes from Shein? Don't have the money. Spend $70 to fill tank of gas? Disgusting. Need a vacation for mental health? Waste of money. I feel like I don't make enough and nothing I do is good enough. Housing went up about 30-40% in my area in the past 4 years and I have had to come to grips with the fact that I am not going to be able to have the same lifestyle I had in 2018/2019 without spending a LOT more money or going into more debt.



COVID nearly destroyed my career, put my ex and I in a very hard financial position. My mental health took a hit and went into depression. Took about two years to finally get back on track to the point where my credit score wasn't below 600 and not having tons of things sent to collections. When my ex decided they no longer wanted to be with me last year, we were still living together and the cost of living for basic things where we lived had skyrocketed. Most of my paychecks were going towards bills, basic living necessities, etc and at one point had $100 in my bank account during a Christmas season and had to rely on old gift cards to restaurants my ex had saved to get dinner. 

  
I've cut back on eating out, drinking, hobbies, etc and nothing feels like it is good enough. Is there a psychological thing going on that I don't know about? Could all this be because of the financial hardships I've had in the past few years?",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1ft7m9x/terrified_of_money_and_fear_spending_money_on/,1727732838.0,TonightIll4637,1ft7m9x,advice_seeking

A&P) could also apply to speech language pathology and any number of healthcare fields.

Somehow I only now started to seriously consider the financial repercussions of being out of work and in debt for the next four years. OTs (four years more of school) and SLPs (three more years of school) in my state make on average $70K. I am not wealthy and feel behind in my retirement saving.

My questions for y'all, depending on your experience:

If you've made a similar late-stage career change that required going back to school, has it been worth the financial investment? If you're in a healthcare, are there other job options with smaller barriers to entry that require creative problem solving, empathy, and positivity? If you're financially savvy, give it to me straight: at my age and with my lack of savings, is going to graduate school (OT school costs approx. $68K) going to hurt me in the long run?

Thanks in advance for reading this far and for your advice! (I'm new to reddit, sorry if this is too long.)",240,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1l9zuv4/is_it_financially_foolish_re_retirement_to_go_to/,1749767239.0,Significant_Bat200,1l9zuv4,advice_seeking
personalfinance,go back to school,Back to school - what degree?,"I’m seriously considering going back to school and would love to get some thoughts from this community on what degree to pursue. 

I’m fortunate that I haven’t needed a job in the last few years but now that I am divorced, my sizeable alimony will float me for a while, but I will need to go back into the job market eventually. And even when I’m back in the job market, I won’t need to earn a 6 figure salary. 

I’m considering either a degree in accounting or finance. 

I don’t have much thought about career goals right now; I was in big tech for a long time before leaving the workforce. I don’t have any experience in either accounting nor finance, but over the last few years, understanding financial security has been really interesting and important to me. Post degree I do want to give back to the community and do some volunteering to teach financial security at a library, or help with tax preparation, stuff like that. I don’t want to be an investment banker or a financial planner. 

Help me decide a degree: accounting? Or finance? Pros and cons to each? ",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1miops4/back_to_school_what_degree/,1754436076.0,ConsiderationMean698,1miops4,advice_seeking
personalfinance,go back to school,Temporarily reducing my 401k Contribution so my wife can be a Stay-at-home mom,"My wife (F31) and I (M31) recently had our first child and my wife would really like to be a stay at home mom, at least until the child is old enough to go to preschool. That’s around 36 month. We both work currently; if Only I work and we cut out most unnecessary living expenses my take home pay we’d barely be in the red.  If I drop my 401k contribution from the current 14% to 6% so I still get my company match I’d have around $300 leftover each month. If I don’t contribute it would be $700 extra a month.

We currently have $100k in stocks/emergency fund and our 401ks combined are $340k.

My wife only has a high school degree. She works in customer service so it’s not like she’s giving up a lucrative career. She has a decent job but she could easily come back to the workforce in 3 years and make the exact same amount she makes now. She’s in great standing with her company and they’ve said if she does leave they’d hire her back immediately.

We do not pay for childcare; we both have large families and have family members who will watch her for a year or two without charging us. So, having my wife stop working doesn’t help with childcare costs like it would for most people.

Finally, our home is relatively low maintenance. I don’t expect to replace my furnace, AC, water heater, roof or well anytime in the near future because the previous owners were meticulous and didn’t cheap out when it came to big expenses. We each have Toyotas that are about 10 years old with lower mileage and we own them outright.

I think it would be best for our child’s development for my wife to stay home and it’s what she wants. What do you think? Are we in a place where this makes sense financially. I think we can do it but I’m scared to pull the trigger. I like my financial stability; I’ve always been frugal and living on the edge scares me.

Are there other major factors I’m not thinking of?",480,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1m7fml6/temporarily_reducing_my_401k_contribution_so_my/,1753292011.0,Frantic_Fanatic13,1m7fml6,advice_seeking
personalfinance,go back to school,Going back to school with a lot of debt (22),"Hi guys, so I think I have a solid game plan, but obviously my previous lack of understanding when it came to financials has put me in the situation I'm in, so I figured the assist of strangers on the internet might be beneficial. This is a throwaway account so please bare with my lack of karma. 

I am looking for recommendations on what to pay off first, and how to maximize my debt payoffs to meet the 2.25 year deadline (if needed it can be pushed). Also open to recommendations for school assistance. (I dont qualify for federal or state assistance).

I recently went back to school, current plan is to get my associates and pay for it outright, and accrue no additional debt. Then determine if I can work through my bachelors, or if I will need to switch to part time. My goal is to pay off either all of my debt or as close to as possible by aug of 2027 (so about two years). 

Debts: 

2970 -Apple card- 26.24% Interest rate- 92$ minimum 30th monthly

2388 - Vehicle loan- 7.39% interest rate - 78$ minimum 9th monthly 

3754 - motorcycle loan- 8.09% interest rate - 158 $ minimum 9th monthly

6849- Visa Credit Card- BECU-  15.24 % interest rate- 171 minimum 1st monthly

17,541- More rewards amex- NFCU- 13.9% interest rate- 390 minimum 28th monthly 

900$ monthly towards debt payoffs (minimums). 33,502 total debt. 

Living Expenses:

30$ electricity 19th

625$ rent 1st

55$- phone bill 9th

27.39 planet fitness 17th 

149$ insurance 30th

936$ monthly towards living expenses. 

My education is about 1500$ every quarter (3 months).   
I have been able to throw about 1000$ towards debt pay off monthly, except this month because it went towards school.   
My income is approximately 65,000 post tax yearly, its commission and hourly, so some months are better than others.   
I always keep 1000$ in my emergency fund for anything that may come up.   
I have fixed my credit card problem, and they are all frozen, accumulating no further debt.   
My spending is approximately 500$ monthly for gas, groceries, and dining out. I meal prep weekly and only spend 50$ per week and dine out maybe once a week to every other week. 

My current plan has been to ensure 1000$ in emergency savings. 1000$ towards debts, and anything left over towards debts.   
I am going to have to go in debt most likely for law school, so I have about 4 years to be completely out of debt (to be able to accumulate more, unfortunately).   
I don't qualify for any financial aid, and haven't gotten any scholarships. Once I hit 1 year at my job (December) then I will qualify for 5100$ towards education yearly, as long as I maintain my 4.0. 

TLDR; paying for associates in full, 6000$ yearly cost. 33.5k in debt. 65k income. 2 years to get as much paid off as possible. 4 years to be completely out of debt.

I'm currently on SSDI and bring in just under $1,400 a month and live at hom, though I do pay for most of my own expenses.

Here's why I'm asking.. my parents claimed me on their taxes last year. I asked them not to, they did it anyway thinking it would save them a huge amount (hint: it didn't). I didn't make anything last year (didn't even have my SSDI payments) so the CPA told me and signed that I didn't need to file. 

Do I count as a dependent? Do I need to list my parents or have their participation in any of this process? My federal debt from undergrad is 20k, so I imagine if social services didn't hold up their side of the deal I could at least get a loan of under 10k?

I am in the Deep South where there aren't many resources for folks like me.

personalfinance,is a master's degree worth it,Am I overreacting or does whole life insurance seem like a scam?,"Recently met up with a financial advisor for my uncle and he signed me up for a roth IRA and whole life insurance. I was originally under the impression that he would go over my finances with me and educate me on ways to improve savings spending. Instead he immediately signed my up for life insurance the roth IRA. He barely even covered my income or savings at all. The guy seemed like more of a salesman then an actual financial advisor. 

I haven't officially started the policy because I haven't taken the blood draw yet (I wasn't told I would have to take one BEFORE signing up) I absolutely hate the idea of an insurance company taking blood from my body and sending my medical data to god knows where. I also vape too so if I take blood drawl  I will be given a ""smokers"" rate which I am sure will be absurd premium. During the original application I was asked if I use tobacco and I said no. However these faulty blood test will detect nicotine and give me the smokers rate. If I end up dead and my family ask for a payout they can deny based on that alone. 

What also scares me is that recently my mom needed me and my siblings to literally help her pay for her 400 dollar a month life insurance (NUTS!) a health event happened and she is no longer working. So if she misses even one payment she gets absolutely nothing when she dies? So you are expected to be 90 years old still paying life insurance otherwise you don't get a penny correct? It almost seems like it insentivizes dying early. Which I find terrifying. Also it makes your friends and family lowkey want you to die for financial reasons or feel a little too comfortable with you dying. Instead of preparing to take care of themselves in the event of your death they will just be like ""Nahh it's all good he has life insurance"" then when the money really runs out they are screwed.

I have no children or dependents. I am 26 years old. Just doesn't seem worth it to me. The advisor did also mention some sort of ""investments"" but it seems like it's the same exact thing as a roth IRA except more fee's and penalties. I have been stalling the blood drawl test and pretty much just ignoring their calls trying to schedule an exam. I really don't feel like falling for the same mistakes over and over. If it sounds too good to be true it probably is. If I could go back in time I would have never listened to my older relatives about going to college and getting a graphic design degree (Just to be replaced by AI image generation the moment I graduate). By far the worst financial decesion I have ever made. Recently I have been pressured to get a car loan, sign up for life insurance, go to college with debt, sign up for credit cards and go BACK to school for masters after loan companies ask me to pay. I am sorry but it's just how insane the older generation seems when giving ""advice"" to the younger generation. It's like it's either a complete scam or just a debt trap. The advice might work for people in an entirely different tax bracket. But for middle middle class people or younger people just starting out that BARELY survive I really don't get how these sort of ""investments"" and insurances make sense? In what world does it make sense to spend a third of your social security income on life insurance?

personalfinance,is a master's degree worth it,Should I take a gap year at 37 to travel and reset? [NZ / Career advice],"Hi everyone, I’m looking for some advice or similar experiences. I’m 37, living in New Zealand, and have been building my career for years, backed by a master’s degree and a high-paying role. The thing is, I’m really burnt out. The environment is toxic, and the pressure is constant. I don’t enjoy the work anymore, and it’s impacting my health and quality of life.

I’m seriously considering taking a year off to travel and recharge. The idea excites me, but I’m terrified about what comes after. What if I struggle to find a job when I come back, especially one that matches my current salary? I know there’s no guarantee I’ll find the same level of role after a year off, and I worry that taking a gap might look like a red flag to future employers.

personalfinance,is a master's degree worth it,"How can I retire as quickly as possible? (£4.5k/month income, £1.5k expenses, remote job).","Hey everyone,

I’m hoping to get some guidance from this awesome community. I'm a 26 year-old (born in India, living in the UK for the past 2 years) and I’m trying to figure out the most efficient path toward financial independence.

Here’s a quick snapshot of my situation:

I have a master’s degree and currently work a remote job that pays me about £4,500/month after taxes.

My total monthly expenses are around £1,500, so I’m saving roughly £3,000/month.

I have no debt and no credit history.

I have around 4.5k worth of stocks. 2k worth of bitcoin. 

I own a rental property in India (was left to me by my grandpa).

I could live in India (much cheaper), but I genuinely prefer the quality of life in the UK — even if it slows down the path a bit.


My main goal is to own a small farm in a beautiful countryside and be financially independent as quickly as I can, ideally within 10 years (or less, if possible). I’ve been researching investing and saving strategies, but it’s a bit overwhelming, and I’d love to hear directly from people who've been there or are on the journey.

So I’d love to know:

What would you do in my position?

Would you prioritize investing in index funds, buying property, or something else?

Should I build credit in the UK even if I don’t plan to borrow?

And is it worth for me to stay in the uk only because I prefer it?

Any thoughts, tips, or even stories from your own journey would mean a lot. Thanks in advance!

personalfinance,is a master's degree worth it,Saving up for a house as a college student.,"Hi everyone! 

I am writing here in hope to get advice and guidance on how to plan my future to buy a house rather sooner than later. 

My demographics: 
- A college student (first year)
- First-gen immigrant (immigrated 3 years ago), but white for what it’s worth (not from Europe, though) 
- NOT a citizen or a permanent resident (i.e. no green card) but going to stay in the U.S. for at least the decade for sure (and afterwards as well, or will have a legal access to come to the country without additional legal work) 
- Speak two languages fluently, can learn a third hopefully 

My financial background: 
- My parents immigrated recently, they have no savings or investments, made <35K/year for the past years, can be a little more this year, but nothing impressive 
- They have a younger dependent who they’ll be taking care of for the next 6-10 years 
- I have no student loans and my education almost completely is covered by the scholarships I’ve received (there’s like 4k a year left, my family covers it just fine) 
- I am working this summer until August 10th probably and then going off to college. My summer job is usually 4 but can be up to 6 hours a day, 25/hr. I can do the same job during Christmas break (a month long) and potentially any next summer. 
- Current amount of money saved up from work: $2 755. 

My career goals: 
- After receiving my Bachelor’s degree (Political Science and International Relations) I would hope to get a Master’s in Education 6-12 (i.e. qualify as a school teacher) and enroll in a PhD program (I am dreaming of a job in academia— being a professor in college, writing books and researching). 
About Master’s in Education: I would probably just do a community college because it’s cheaper. Yet, I want a great PhD program (didn’t decide on which one yet) and work in a small liberal arts college ideally. 

My financial goals: 
- Buy a house (East Coast, north, so maybe $500-800k, at least 2 bedroom but ideally 3– I want a big family) before starting a family 
- Take as little loans out as humanly possible in the U.S. (ideally, only for big things like mortgage) 

Things I am not ready to sacrifice: 
- Having pretty things/going out here and there (not every week and not insane amount, ready to set a budget & find less expensive ways to do it, for example I started thrifting instead of buying off Amazon or Macy’s) 
- Eating good. I am not implying anything crazy, I’m just saying not living off rice and beans for a month. Having meat, veggies on the table. (For the next 4 years I’m pretty much covered on this one though!) 

What advice do you have for someone in a situation like this? Considering inflation, for how much for a house should I aim? How do I budget? 

Tell me everything I can possibly utilize! Thanks a lot! 

Much love! ",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1m2pa2j/saving_up_for_a_house_as_a_college_student/,1752801915.0,Ouch_1243,1m2pa2j,advice_seeking
personalfinance,is a master's degree worth it,Planning a Unique Financial Situation,"My family is in a unique financial situation and in need of sound advice. I am a 32M and wife is a 32F. We have a <1 year old child. We are in a decent amount of debt ($350k), but I am 5-7 years out from being an extremely high earner ($500k+ per year). 

To preface, I have been bad with money my entire life. I grew up in an extremely poor and chaotic household, which I believe led me to having an unhealthy relationship with money. I understand that I need to solve this root problem first.

I recently graduated from medical school and I begin my training in a surgical specialty that is 5 years long. I am considering fellowship training, which is 2 years without any jump in compensation at the end (passion is important to me). In 5-7 years, I should start around $500-600k per year. In addition to this salary, I will also receive my veteran benefits for life (~$50k per year untaxed income).

The VA covered my undergrad and medical school and gave me a stipend. However, I have $150k in both private and federal student loans at an average 6% interest due to poor financial decisions. My wife has a masters degree with $120k in federal student loans at 6% interest. Other debt includes $30k personal loan at 6.5% ($950 per month), a 40k car loan at 9% ($850 per month), a leased car that’s about to end in a few months ($425 per month), and $15k on a canceled credit card ($385 per month).  We can defer my federal loans, but my private loans and her federal loans have a minimum payment of $650 per month. Our living expenses are ~$5000 per month.

My current compensation is decent. My residency salary is $70k per year. My veteran benefits are about $75k untaxed. My wife will be a SAHM during my training, but down the road she earns around $60-70k per year in her profession.

Here is the kicker - we have no savings and no retirement. 

Due to my high future earning potential and poor financial habits, I have always prioritized quality of life for my family during this rough phase of training. I am in desperate need of sound advice. Give it to me straight!

My ultimate question is: 

Over the next 5-7 years, do we prioritize paying off debt, saving, or a combination of the two? If paying off debt, how should we tackle it? If saving, should it be establish an emergency fund, max Roth IRA, then invest in 403b? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

EDIT: a few missed details initially.
1) the used vehicle loan is upside down around $10k (car is worth $30k).
2) the 15k is our only credit card debt. It is canceled and on a payment plan accruing $13 in interest a month on the $385 payment.

Can’t do HSA yet as I’m on Tricare so not eligible but once I’m out I will max that out. But that’s not a lot.

So looking at 529 - however, I already have my masters, which is as high as I’d need for my field, I have tuition assistance from employers that cover certs. might be looking at law school but it’s very up in the air might not happen. It’d be a career switch from a high paying career so either have to figure out how to do it part time or I’d only do it if my field goes to shit. Can I even use it for myself?

Husband has bachelor looking at master degree soon but more than likely employer pay for it…

No kids and not planning anytime soon, possible will never have kids, just too early to decide. Waiting till my biological clock runs to end and I’m forced to decide. But even if we do, possible we’d have them join military and military pay for it. Again, all hypothetical. 

I’m a little confused how 529 is used and if in our case it’s even worth exploring. I don’t wanna be stuck with 6 figure (fast forward a few years) in a 529 that I can’t use for what I want; like out of state college, or trade school, or just not needing degree paid for.

A few months in my parents divorce got very nasty and my father did everything he could to financially ‘screw over’ my mum and me. Then covid hit and my mums business collapsed, basically we were in a financial hole. As a result she could no longer help me with living costs and I had to withdraw from my course. My father was abusive my whole life and throughout this process, in every way. 

I’ve decided to try to heal this wound and due to really struggling to find work since, I have applied for and been accepted onto the same programme. The work gap from covid lockdown plus not having the degree has just compounded and stretched til now leaving me in such a vulnerable position. Brain fog and feeling hopeless due to PTSD has not helped. 

Anyway, student finance require evidence of ‘compelling personal reasons’ for my initial withdrawal. They’ve denied it all so far as apparently police reports and bank statements showing only £3000 in my mums account don’t count. They’ve said evidence must be from a ‘professional person’ who was privy to my situation at the time. I’ve reached out to the psychotherapist I was seeing at the time but as this was years ago I am anxious she will be unable or unwilling to provide evidence. I reached out to my tutor from the time but very unfortunately he is on academic leave so I’m not sure he will be able to help. Couldn’t be worse timing. I considered also reaching out to the divorce lawyer as she was privy to the financial situation, not sure if this would count but - worth a shot.

My friends and partner keep telling me to just pursue these avenues and see and stay calm but I am panicking that I will still be denied or that they won’t pan out. My father has always negatively affected and limited my life so I am just so determined to get this degree, find employment and be happy. My life has been really limited and unhappy this far through no fault of my own. He paid in full for my younger brother to do a masters and has since had another child with a woman half his age in secret, another son who he is leaving all his money to. I have been completely screwed over just because I’m a girl and it has been so traumatic only making me more determined to succeed. It has been my dream for the past decade. I am just so worried that I won’t be able to access the student loan. I’m running out of time and options.

My question is what are my alternatives if denied? I have no family money. My mum has put aside enough to help me with living costs but can’t also pay the tuition fee on top. I obviously have quite rubbish credit as I’ve never had a salary, made big purchases. I just want to move forward with my life and work hard.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1llsovt/uk_student_loan_stress/,1751027521.0,sadpony96,1llsovt,advice_seeking
personalfinance,is a master's degree worth it,"How Do You Measure If A Degree is ""Worth"" The Debt?","How do you assess/measure whether the student debt you would incur to obtain a degree is ""worth it""? 

A common discussion on this subreddit is whether a degree was a ""good"" investment. Sometimes it seems pretty obvious to me, when considering the immediate impact of the degree on wages and the total cost of tuition. $200,000 for a bachelors in acting from a 3rd tier private college? Probably not worth it. $40,000 for a bachelors in finance from a local community college? Probably worth it. 

But is there some sort of formula or rule of thumb that could be used to assess this? Im thinking like how housing costs shouldn't be more than 1/3 of your monthly salary, or how you should have 1x your salary saved for retirement at 30 years old. 

Maybe something like ""total debt divided by expecred increase in yearly salary should be >10,"" etc?

Context: I'm looking at taking on $80,000 in tuition for a 2 year masters, and wondering if it's really ""worth"" it. I know a lot of people who went into college blind and walked out with $120,000+ of debt and a whooooole lot of regret.

personalfinance,quit job to start business,"I quit my job 5 weeks ago to start a window cleaning business, then broke my leg on a motorcycle","hey all, im in a bit of a strange situation and seeking some guidance, or any possible resources i can access in order to gain the information im in search of.

For back ground information im located in USA, Kansas to be exact. As previously stated i left my job as an electrician approximately 5 1/2 weeks ago in order to start my business. ive already gotten as far as owning my LLC. payed for the next 12 months of insurance coverage for the business, acquired all my equipment, etc. i was going to start operations the week following my injury (3-23-2025). At my previous job i always carried great insurance with supplemental coverages such as aflac due to the fact that im an active guy and i ride motorcycles. it goes without being said i no longer have any of that coverage since i left the previous company. 

where im finding myself in my state atleast is an odd spot in regard to filing for a short term assistance offered by the state. i dont seem to quite fall into the requirements for unemployment OR temporary total disability which are the two programs my state offers for something like this (to my knowledge). Unemployment requires the ability to work and seek employment. TTD (which im still not 100% clear on) seems to maybe only be available for on the job injury? or am i mistaken in my interpretation of the states requirements? 

Thank you for the help, sorry for the poor format im new to reddit! ",364,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1kh4z40/i_quit_my_job_5_weeks_ago_to_start_a_window/,1746643147.0,Temporary-Pie-9521,1kh4z40,advice_seeking
personalfinance,quit job to start business,Opinions please: How stupid is it to quit my job to travel for 6 months in 2025? ,"Hello Reddit! This is a throwaway account, as it feels vulnerable to write all of this. I was hoping for some general perspective, pieces of advice, or any input on my situation at all really. I've been planning on taking time off by quitting my current job in May with no backup, but the current job market is making me seriously reconsider. For background, I have always had a job (except during 3 college semesters when I was too busy to work) since I was 16 and am now 28, I live in the US. Each year since I turned 25, I've promised myself that the next year I will quit and take 6-months to travel, as I have always been limited by what little vacation days American jobs give you (usually 2 weeks per year) and traveling is my passion. However, I always lose my nerve and get stuck in my job out of fear, with the idea that I just need to save more money to feel safe enough to do it. 

My first job out of college wasn't too bad, but my last two jobs which I held for a year each I have been very unhappy at. I have had depression for the last two years and had a full mental breakdown 3 years ago in which I ended up in a hospital, but therapy is starting to help. I think I would like to leave my field and wanted to take a 6-month gap to travel and really think about things. My family supports this and tells me I need to do it. My Mom especially says I should, as I am young and don't have a house or any other major commitments.

Here is my financial breakdown: 

1. Retirement Investments: $56,933 
2. Personal Investments: $47,063 (mostly VTSAX, VOO)
3. Liquid Savings: $42,515 (about 17 months of current expenses)
4. No Debt 
5. Stock options; in the future could either be worth $0 or hundreds of thousands, I count them as $0. 

My passion is backpacking, which makes my style of travel extremely cheap. I don't have to pay for hotels (I sleep in a tent) and just eat from grocery stores.

My plan was to quit in May and travel on and off for about 6 months, with a total budget of $15,000. Once I hit the $8,000 spending mark, I was going to start applying to jobs while traveling. Once I spent the $15,000, I would full stop, move in for free with my parents (they offered), and take literally any minimum wage job that will take me, just to cover my living expenses (food, gas, car insurance). In the worst case scenario, if I don't get hired anywhere I actually want to work longer term, I will apply to a low cost fire academy program and do that full time. I think I'd like to explore being a firefighter, for a bunch of reasons that I feel are unrelated to this post, but I can go into them in the comments if anyone is curious. 

My question, is it incredibly stupid to do this? Does my plan sound logical, or manic and stupid? I know how bad the job market is, it took 6 months of rigorous applying to get my current role, so it's no joke out there. And to be honest, I have just gotten lucky with every job I've ever gotten, I am not an impressive candidate at all. Plus, I know it's infinitely easier to get a job while you have a job, and I don't feel like I really have enough savings or investments for my age and income level to do something this risky. That being said, I keep putting this off and grinding my mental health down to save money, in a career field that I don't like. I am scared the more time I let go, the more commitments and reasons I will have to never do this, and I will regret not doing it in my 20s. 

What would you do in my situation? I greatly appreciate anyone who took the time to read this long post and comment, and I won't be offended if you all think I am idiotic for even considering this in 2025. Thanks and happy new year everyone! 

EDIT: Thank you so much for all of your input! I never imagined I would get such a large response and so much support, it really means a lot! The comments are all so well rounded and brought a lot of perspective and ideas. One thing that came up a lot is that I didn't factor in health insurance, which is a good point! I will look into how much that costs and recalculate my emergency fund length.

I tried to respond to everyone but found that I couldn't keep up. Here are some answers to common questions:

1. I work in the pharmaceutical manufacturing field.
2. My savings/investments weren't gifts from my parents, I just like to save, but they did give me a huge variety of privileges that allowed for my high savings rate that I am grateful for and that many others don't have. For example they let me live at home rent free whenever I needed in the past (I don't live with them atm) and they paid for my college (I know this is HUGE, its a major major privilege, and things like this is why no one should compare themselves to others). They are also just nice people, which is a huge privilege in itself.
3. I can ask my employer for a leave of absence, but I am doubtful it will be approved given our aggressive yearly targets for 2025, they would probably need to replace me even if they didn't want to.
4. My field is highly competitive, if I tried to get back into it I would expect it would take me between 3-12 months to find a job. That being said, I may not want to get back into it anyway, it doesn't suit my personality unfortunately. Firefighting is my current possible pivot career, but we will see if that changes. I am a female so I may not even pass the physical entrance exams, but I'm still training hard for it!

personalfinance,quit job to start business,My boss has not paid me and I don’t know what to do,"Update: I have quit! And I have already found a new job, I start on Friday! Thanks to all for your messages. My next goal is to get myself a car! 

I (25f) have been working for this employer for over 3 years. I met him in Mexico and I started working for his travel company since 2022. 
I am an American citizen and he currently lives in the USA too. (He is on a business visa, I am almost sure it is an E-2). He created his own company here and asked me if I wanted to work for him. 
This implies moving to the states and starting my life from zero: looking for a place to live, trying to build credit (since I have lived most of my life in Mexico), and so on. 

I did the move, I am now here in the states and he promised to pay me weekly. This is the third full week he has not paid me. I am highly considering getting a new job or even moving to Vegas where my dad’s side of the family is and where I did live for 10 years of my childhood.

I’m in Utah. He only pays me $13 an hour and he suddenly says he cannot afford to pay me my 40 hours so he needs to cut it to 20 hours starting on Monday. (Note he told me this on Tuesday). 

He also likes to victimize himself saying that he has nothing saved up and he needs to uber in order to pay my wage. It is not my problem he didn’t have a financial plan before launching a company. 

I’ve already been here for a month and a half, and I sometimes feel regretful believing in him. Any advice on what I should do? 

Since he said he would pay me weekly, I organized my payments around this, now I am behind. 

I have sent him messages and he ignores me. He comes to the office and does the Irish goodbye so he doesn’t have to encounter me to talk.

Also note that if I leave, he will no longer have any employees. Between the two, I am the only one who speaks English. 

Edit: this is my actual first post on here. How can I like your comments? Thank you for all the input on my situation and for validating what I have been thinking

Edit2: wow, he just paid. But still, after reading you (and already had my gut feeling). I am going to leave. Thank all of you again for your comments and kind messages too.

personalfinance,quit job to start business,I'm spending over 20% of my income on healthcare despite being pretty healthy,"I make around 42,000 a year before taxes give or take (I make commission and tips in addition to a base salary so my income can vary). I get health insurance through my workplace. I stupidly chose the second highest tier plan because I needed mental healthcare covered. I also added dental and vision. Because of this $287 is taken out of my biweekly paychecks. Unfortunately, no mental healthcare providers will take my insurance anyways. It costs me $75 per a 10 minute zoom session once a month to get vyvanse prescription refilled and then I have to pay for the prescription itself as well as up to 3 other prescriptions, which ends up being costly. My psychiatrist also wants me to start attending weekly therapy. I can't find a therapist that takes my insurance and is also currently taking patients. Even with my insurance, it would cost me $50 per week. My only health problems that I know of are mental. I am physically fit and 30 years old. While I know the premium I pay is technically income exempt from taxes, it feels like tax in and of itself. I calculated how much I spent last year on healthcare including premiums, monthly psychiatrist visits, prescriptions, dental care, and other doctor visits and it was a little over 20% of my income. However, I missed the enrollment period to change my benefits. I was incredibly busy and stressed out through the fall and by the time I realized it, I was a few days too late. They also cut my base salary and commission rate over the summer so I'll likely be making less overall. What do I do? Or is there nothing I can do? 

Edit: Many people are advising that I find a new job. Let me clarify. While my job may not seem high paying to most people, my job is considered fairly  high paying for my field even with the pay cut. If I went elsewhere, I would likely take an even bigger pay cut. I also likely wouldn't even be offered benefits. 7 employees at the time of the pay cut quit, and according to the people I've kept in touch with, they are all struggling. That's why I've stayed at my job despite the pay cut.",351,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1i4l4ho/im_spending_over_20_of_my_income_on_healthcare/,1737244916.0,Few_Giraffe_2627,1i4l4ho,advice_seeking
personalfinance,quit job to start business,We just won money in a lawsuit...Now what?,"Hi! We (couple, late 30's) just won an injury case and the money is coming shortly and we don't know what to do. It's a little under 800k. We are going to park it in a CD/HYSA for a few months while we figured it out. So many people are telling us to purchase property but not sure thats the go-to right now. We both grew up struggling with money and both sets of our parents aren't in great financial shape. Hubby has a decent job (now) and makes somewhat decent money (finally) and I started a freelance business a few years ago and am just getting on my feet with it (still growing and will get there but not exactly raking it in quite yet and not able to contribute savings much to anything yet). He has a good amount of college loan debt we want to figure out/pay off but the interest is low so we can wait on paying that. I think our biggest goals are to just be stable. So we will park it in a HYSA/CD until we figure it out, and have a 6-12 months of expenses in an accessible account. We want to invest but know nothing so maybe property will would be better but have heard some tenant horror stories and it just seems rough out there right now. Wondering if we do invest in stocks we can use that to pay off his student debt in 2-3 years if thats even possible or if we just leave it and keep paying the monthly. Leaning investing but we're so financially illiterate (I know we can get there) and its a little scary. We will hire a flat rate fiduciary advisor but any advice to start after we park it in the CD? (I also very much know not to tell anyone about this lol). Should we just throw most of it in the stock market?

\*\*\*Edit to add\*\*\* 
We are through the medical aspects of this and won't need any ongoing care/future surgeries for the injury (please just trust me on this because I can't go into many details) that happened and this was not a car accident.
This is also our take home after the legal fees/etc.

personalfinance,quit job to start business,Please help me not blow my trust fund ,"My (20F) family has been middle class my entire life. My dad owned a local grocery store with 8 locations across my state, but it was not profitable until a few years ago and he could not afford to take out much of a salary. In 2020 when everything else came crashing down, the store actually started doing really well and was truly profitable for the first time. To make a long store short, he sold the business last year for quite a large chunk of money. 

This month, I found out that he has put the money in a family trust and I will be given about 60k a year for life. I also work part time right now as I am in school, so it will end up being 60k plus whatever I make at my job (which will increase when I go full time after graduation). I am so grateful, and my biggest fear is not making the most of the opportunity he has given me or wasting any money. 

Any advice on how to best allocate this money would be appreciated. Or just advice on being a young person learning to work with money for the first time! 

Also, just to get this out of the way- I know trust fund kids are annoying and I always made fun of them too before I became one. I promise that I am cripplingly self aware of how privileged I am.

personalfinance,quit job to start business,Help me quit one of my jobs,"I would like to quit one of my jobs in order to massively free up my time and greatly reduce my stress caused by said job. My fiancé is very supportive of this idea, however I am having a hard time walking away from the extra income.

My fiancé recently received a salary increase from $90k to $120k. After taxes, difference in weekly paychecks is nominal. He contributes 3% to a simple IRA w/ company matching. Current filing status is single-0. Mortgage payment at \~$1800/mo. Utilities \~$400/month, $10k in low interest equipment loans. Monthly vehicle payment $556.

I work 3 jobs:

* Job 1 is $70k salary, 40 hours a week, lots of downtime, minimal stress.
* Job 2 is \~$5200 a year, an hour a week running payroll for the same company as my fiancé (my family's business) 
* Job 3 is \~$21k a year, 12 hours a week, highly stressful, convinced this job gave me shingles, am never able to take a vacation without my laptop, would really love to quit. The caveat here is that this company is in the process of a buyout and we don't know what that situation will look like. My plan was to stick out the transitional period and then leave but that was supposed to be May and it's now almost August and there's no end in sight yet. 

Contributing 3% of Job 2 to the simple IRA w/ company matching (I used to be here full time and never changed the contribution setup). $6k in credit card debt but spending has been halted until paid down. $7k in savings, earmarked for upcoming wedding. I cover the cost of all of our groceries \~$1000/mo. and dining out \~$600/mo. $400 monthly car payment. Current filing status single-0. Previously operated a small art business that made $18k a year on a very seasonal basis with very little marketing effort, mostly word of mouth commission pieces, considering replacing Job 2 with this but understand that the income from that is in no way guaranteed. 

I do plan for our grocery bill to greatly reduce if I were to quit Job 3 since the additional time in my day would allow for less dining out / takeout and more conscientious meal planning. I just get so anxious thinking about walking away from the income from Job 3. I think about our debt and how great it would be to pay it all off and how we aren't saving nearly as much as we should towards retirement. 

Options we've discussed: 

* Previously mentioned, restarting my art business for a cushion. Now would be a good time to start so it will have time to ramp up before the holidays. 
* Getting married at the courthouse and changing filing status to married filing jointly (destination ceremony planned for next fall but we're both fine to sign the paperwork whenever, especially if it makes sense from a financial standpoint)

personalfinance,quit job to start business,What should I do with a 45k inheritance at 22 years old?,"Unfortunately my grandmother passed away about half a year ago. She left quite a sizeable amount of savings, which means I will be inheriting about 45k. I'm just wondering what people would advise me to do with this money?

So far, I've considered:

* Using part of the money to pay for a Master's at Oxford (Medieval Studies) or Bristol (Psychology) - unsure on career path right now, Medieval Studies is a passion but psychology would be a well-paid and meaningful profession.
* Travelling! I didn't grow up with much money. My parents were always in debt. We never once went on holiday, save Butlins. So I'd like to explore! I saved up a bit when I was 18 and 21 and have already been to Paris, Florence, Rome, Tirana, etc. Would love to use a decent chunk of the money to go interrailing, to take classes abroad (i.e. Latin course in Rome), do some charity work, and so on. I've also suffered very badly with mental health across my life, so will be looking to get away into nature and work with animals as a way to heal from a few things. At a minimum I need to travel just a little bit, but I'd also love to just go away for a year and explore everything religious and historical and beautiful etc.
* Investing! I don't have a clue how to invest, I'll be honest. Should I just stick some money into a portfolio? How much? Into what kind of shares?
* Sticking money into a high-interest ISA for a down payment on a house? To be honest, I don't really want to settle down any time soon, I'm far too unstable for that at the moment, but I know this would be a 'sensible' thing to do. As soon as I get a job I'd straight away be able to cough up the money for a downpayment.
* Using the money to 'invest' in other ways, i.e. I'm a photographer so could start a photography business? I also write so look into publishing my work independently?

Some things about me:

* I'm 22 and going into my final year at a top 10 uni (don't wanna say which for anonimity sake)
* I have several physical and mental health conditions which I might need to seek private treatment for
* I can't drive yet (although have done a lot of hours, just need to restart) and don't have a car. Was thinking maybe of getting a mobile home to travel with?
* Still live at home with my parents outside of term time (in a very rural area)
* I can't work at the moment due to my mental and physical health. Not because I'm fully disabled but because I need control over my own routine at the moment due to the complexity of my condition (which hopefully I will recover from)

What should I do? I understand there isn't a perfect way to do things. I'm still young, I know, so I think I can afford to enjoy a decent chunk of the money, especially as things like travelling and taking a year off after uni is very much needed for me health wise. But I'm not sure on the balance of things. I'd appreciate recommendations of a sort of break down of budgeting 45k.

findapath,passed over for promotion,I'm lucky to have a cushy software engineering job but I'm so unhappy,"I'm 23 and a software engineer at one of those big companies (USA). I worked my ass off in high school, killing myself over test grades until I got a full ride at a pretty decent pretty big public school. I majored in electrical & computer engineering. I wasn't anything special skills wise but I was good at interviewing and had good grades, so I got internships which led to a job.

It's amazing: it's flexible, I'm paid great, I get benefits, and I live in a nice city.

But I'm just so miserable. Work makes me feel frustrated and sick. I'm not a good software engineer. I'm easily confused and have no drive to figure things out on my own. The work is hard, I have to be on-call 30 days a year, and I don't like my coworkers. And I'm tired of AI. I hate the way we have to shill out for it, pretend it's so life changing and good. People act like whoever sucks up to AI the most will be safe in the next batch of layoffs, and maybe they're right. But I hate pretending I needed \[insert our proprietary AI\] just to right some damn emails. At this point, I'd be fine if they replaced me with a glorified chatbot. At least then I'd be forced to make a decision.

I'm a coward and I don't know how to change jobs. Everyone tells me not to pass up on such a good deal. But I have negative motivation to be promoted or progress in this career, so it can't be sustainable for me. And the pay is great but I don't want to ever have kids or anything; my real life aspirations are to make rent each month and spend time with my loved ones.

In college, I took writing and history classes and loved them. If I had tried that any later than my senior year I might have thrown caution to the wind and switched to a major that my engineering classmates would've called ""majoring in unemployment."" It feels like software engineering is the only path forward for me now but I know that can't be true. I know I'm young.

I also want to feel like I'm contributing something to the world. I look at Tech Jobs for Good and nonprofits nearby but it seems most job listings are just more AI work. As a student, I thought AI was interesting. But after seeing how it's damaging the environment and hurting jobs, plus the experience of actually working at a company developing one of the big AIs, I realized how poorly managed the whole thing is. It's just not for me.

I suffered a lot to get here, pushing myself in high school and college despite depression and family issues. I recently got out of an abusive relationship, as well, and it's made me question a lot about life. I'm less miserable than I've been in my past, but I'm still not happy.

I don't want to seem ungrateful. Venting aside, I know I'm so lucky to have these opportunities. That's why it's hard to consider a shift. I made my family proud and I can support myself, which used to be all I wanted. So many people would love to be in my position. Yet I'm so unsatisfied. I remember being a kid and dreaming of being a librarian or artist or writer. I wish I could go back to believing any of that was feasible for me. I wish I had the courage and energy to make one of those careers happen.

I think it would be smartest (and safest) to stick this out as best as I can and try to save towards making some kind of shift. But how do I figure out what I want to do? What options are there with my degree? How do I make sure I can still afford to stay afloat?",118,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1mc4ea1/im_lucky_to_have_a_cushy_software_engineering_job/,1753771556.0,confusedinthestars,1mc4ea1,advice_seeking
findapath,passed over for promotion,I am 25 years old and feel like a failure,"Cliché. I recently turned 25 years old, and something clicked. In a bad way. I realised that I have literally nothing, and the time to earn something rather easily has already passed. 

From the moment I completed high school, I was lost. Did not know what to do, how, or when, chose a completely random degree to pursue, which was biotechnology. Failed miserably and dropped it after around 2 months due to feeling overwhelmed, because it was difficult. Went abroad to earn some money and learn.   
  
Decided to pursue Journalism, with Marketing specialization. The main idea was to be a great marketer in the gaming industry. This time, it felt too easy; the whole thing felt useless, like I was never learning anything, and just completing the semesters without breaking a sweat. In the meantime, I have discovered that I actually hate marketing, public relations, and all that shit. The only thing that I enjoyed was some history classes, because I adore history with all my heart. In my country, you need to write a thesis to get a bachelor's, and at that moment, it all felt so pointless to me that I just dropped it. Meanwhile, I was trying my own e-commerce business, which was quite successful and gained some money to put into savings, around 15k dollars. Never finished my degree.   
  
Although the gamedev dream remained and I was also spending a little time to learn QA. Somehow landed the job in an outsourcing company and have currently working as a QA Tester for a year now. Even had the chance to work on one of the biggest releases this year. I am fairly good at the things I do, quite often praised by my superiors. But the pay is not that great, just a little over minimum wage in my country. Of course, there are chances for promotions and all, but the game development industry itself is not stable at all, with all the constant layoffs and rather scarce job opportunities. On top of that, I have no idea about anything other than QA in this very competitive industry, so I am kinda useless if I do not learn anything else, and even if I do, I can never be safe to land a better job as a Game Designer, which is my main goal. 

Nevertheless, I have some good habits. I have been training at the gym for around 3 years, and have some good discipline built around it with noticeable progress in both my appearance and physical fitness. I have also trained brazilian jiu-jitsu for some time. I try to eat healthy, keep my surroundings tidy and clean. Socializing is the difficult part. I have some very close friends whom I trust, but getting to know anyone else outside that circle is impossible. Mainly due to distancing myself from people and trust issues. Isolation from others is one of my biggest issues. Sometimes I feel like I'm this dumb brute, who can only really commit to doing physical things, lifting heavy weights, beating someone up. 

I would like to do something meaningful, have some impact on this world. I'm tossing around and turning in all directions. Maybe I should join military? Maybe pursue an engineering degree? Or maybe a history degree, because I like it? I want to start YouTube, because I think I have found some good niches to create content. I also want to still pursue the gamedev dream, but scared as fuck that I'm not good enough, not creative enough, and not smart enough. I even enlisted for the Air Traffic Controller course and will have exams in August, so gonna see how it goes. With so many options, I have some kind of paralysis that prevents me from acting, so I do nothing and mainly play games in my free time. You can get the idea of how torn apart and disappointed with myself I feel right now.

So yeah, I am scared, no degree, just broke up with my girlfriend, not stable career prospects, and generally feel like this is the fucking end, while everyone else is doing better with their stable jobs that require degrees, especially my close friends' group.

findapath,passed over for promotion,Having a (Post-) Quarter Life Crisis,"Hello. I'm a 27F living in Montreal, Canada. Currently, my life is the most stable it has ever been. I have a steady job at a supermarket, and live with my dogs and sisters in Westmount, which is the best place I could be, as a unilingual anglophone (more on that later). The past 4 years I've been focused on doing my job, being there for my family, and slowly building my credit score. This is a good, functional life that I know a lot of people would envy. But this year especially I feel this sense of unrest that's getting harder to ignore. I'm looking at my 30s soon, and the thought of staying in Quebec and just grinding away at my 8-5 fills me with anxiety and even dread.

I'll give some backstory; coming to Quebec was never my choice or a decision I had any part in making. When I was little, my family and I lived in Toronto. Our lives in Toronto were not very stable because my father's job kept on changing, and we'd have to move a lot. Despite the relative chaos of life with my dad, my (American) mother tried her best to prioritize our education and building a foundation for our lives in Toronto. Until one day, my dad made the unilateral decision to uproot everything we'd built to move us to Montreal because of a job he got there, with little consideration for me, my sisters, and our future. It wasn't even discussed with my mother. I was moved away from friends, extra schooling and activities (my music teachers), and familiarity. When we moved here, my French was so behind in high school that they had actually just skipped it for me. (Yes you do learn some French in Toronto schools but no it's not nearly as much as you'll need here. I was very behind.)

There have been multiple setbacks for my family and I. Illnesses, pandemics, life-altering workplace injuries, and so on. But I have the future to look at and I'm wondering seriously if I actually want to remain in Quebec. My opportunities here are limited with my level of French (which I admittedly don't have an affinity for), and some of my struggles with the language lie in personal resentment with my father. My sister is in the same boat as I in terms of work... we are routinely passed over for any kind of promotions. Without the French skills that I wish I had grown up with (I was not taught the language by my French father), there's not much advancement here.

I was hoping for a career in music, which has been my absolute dream since I was 4 years old, but I had been moved away from all my teachers and progress. I can't make any meaningful connections here. The local music scene feels all wrong for me. There are a few who can make it on their own but that's a very lucky bunch. Right now I feel a little hopeless on that front which is why I've just been buckling down and focused on my 8-5... only been managing to do a little bit of self-teaching guitar and music production on the side, in between my busy home and work life.

I wonder what this situation looks like on the outside, so I'd really like to ask: What would you do in my position?

I'm torn between:

1. Sucking it up and buckling down on nailing the French and staying here. (that feels like settling, which I'm not sure I'm content with, spiritually... considering all the baggage that lead up to me being in Quebec),
2. Moving back to Toronto and trying to pick up the pieces.
3. Going somewhere else entirely and seeing what life *could* be. I'm tempted to make a drastic jump and move somewhere like Thailand, or Japan. I've had online friends who've taken that leap and have spoken about how much their quality of life improved... it's tempting but it's risky (+ a whole new set of language issues, but I think I'd be more willing to try because it wouldn't have been imposed on me by my dad lol).

The temptation to do something big and drastic is whispering to me like the Green Goblin mask...",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1lr9egx/having_a_post_quarter_life_crisis/,1751602017.0,GiGi4040,1lr9egx,advice_seeking
findapath,passed over for promotion,Ukrainian Language,"I don't want to drown myself in self-pity, but I have had a pretty rough day and honestly don't know what to do other than tell people my story and look for advice on how to keep the Ukrainian language in my life I'm some way.

I used to work as a language arts teacher but very quickly into my first year of teaching realized that it wasn't for me. The school board didn't think so either and declined to renew my teaching contract, although I don't know for what specific reason. I worked constantly as a teacher and suffered from burnout and never want to return to teaching.

I worked at a fast-food restaurant for about a year and then started working in an office where I do basic administrative tasks. I get paid something like $16.81 an hour. The pay is pretty low, but my co-workers are great and expectations for work are reasonable.

Up until I got passed over for a promotion at work, I had thought that I had the leadership skills to be recognized and promoted as a manager. But it doesn't appear to be that way and perhaps I am in denial about my leadership skills. (Missing the promotion is another story entirely.) So, I decided to start building a copywriting portfolio with emails, blog posts, website copy, etc. But I struggled with perfectionism and never actually dared to take on a client after building a portfolio steadily for about a year and a half.

I felt like my brain turned to mush from so much copywriting, so I decided to volunteer with an organization that helps Ukrainians improve their English skills. I met once a week online with a young woman from Ukraine and helped her improve her English through conversation and the feedback I gave her on her grammar and vocabulary and pronunciation, etc. It turned out to be a profoundly meaningful experience for me. I rediscovered my joy for teaching and felt much more confident in my ability to communicate with people. (I feel horribly self-conscious and awkward at work, but yet when I talk to people one-on-one in language exchanges, I feel like a different person entirely. I can be supportive and friendly and confident.) Over the months of speaking with her, I became curious in the Ukrainian language and started learning the language. I absolutely love learning Ukrainian and taking part on language exchanges and helping Ukrainians improve their English. I get to use the teaching skills that I had from my time as a teacher. Plus, I get to learn all sorts of interesting things about Ukrainian culture. It's proven to be a great way to make friends. I've been learning Ukrainian for two years now and don't plan on stopping at all. But the problem is that I am very aware that simply being fluent in Ukrainian (a dream of mine) isn't necessarily going to lead me to a job. Translation is a dying field. That's okay. Learning Ukrainian can remain a passion of mine.

I am not actively working toward achieving any particular profession at the moment apart from applying to random jobs, which has been a fruitless effort.

I am about to apply for a plumbing apprenticeship but I have absolutely zero interest in working in the trades apart from the financial security it could provide. (Better than $16.81 an hour.) I can't help but think, is it a mistake to work in the trades? Do I really just need to pursue this huge interest in Ukrainian further and see where it takes me? Should I see what it's like to teach adults English as a foreign language? Should I get a Master's in TESOL? Do I try to get a Master's in something else? Should I apply for jobs for the umpteenth time? I am overwhelmed with uncertainty and feelings of inadequacy at the moment, but I refuse to stop learning Ukrainian to pursue something more practical as it has given me so much purpose in life.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1miscx2/ukrainian_language/,1754445981.0,bryanmesserschmidt,1miscx2,advice_seeking
findapath,passed over for promotion,"30, burned out, and ready to pivot — but not sure where to go next 👀","I’m 30 and have spent the last 8–9 years working as a paralegal. I’ve built a solid skill set, but there’s just not much room to grow in this field and with the job market being what it is, even the “apply to remote jobs in higher-paying markets” advice hasn’t panned out. I’ve been ghosted, overlooked, or passed over despite my experience.

I’ve got a degree in political science and have run political campaigns as a side gig for years — fundraising, organizing people, coordinating logistics. I even got promoted to manager at my last job, but was laid off when the company eliminated all remote roles.

To be honest, I’m at a crossroads. I originally wanted to go to law school, but after working closely with attorneys for nearly a decade (most of whom tell me not to do it), I’m not so sure. I don’t think the military is for me, and I’d prefer not to go back to school if I can avoid it.

What I am great at: people management, fundraising, community organizing, and making things happen under pressure.

I’m trying to figure out a new path : one that lets me grow, earn well, and ideally enjoy what I’m doing. I’m not looking for a “dream job,” but I do want something that feels sustainable and rewarding.

If you’ve made a similar pivot — or if you just have insight into where these skills can transfer — I’d really appreciate any advice or direction. What would you explore if you were me?",8,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1lv2s4b/30_burned_out_and_ready_to_pivot_but_not_sure/,1752014843.0,ashcoozie,1lv2s4b,advice_seeking
findapath,passed over for promotion,I’m 17 and I have no clue what I wanna do in life.,"My mom passed my 8th grade year of high school and I used to always say I wanted to be a nurse. Despite that, I never cared about school. I was thankful enough to receive a survivors check from my mom passing but I have an excessive spending problem. I was receiving about 1500 a month but I always spent it within the first week on things like: weed, clothes, and FOOD. 

I started to smoke every single day and I still never really cared about going to school. I missed a lot of school all throughout high school and I’m now a senior. I just stopped smoking a little over two weeks ago because I got suspended for having weed in my purse on school grounds. 

I’m back at school now, but I have no clue what I want to do in life. It all feels so hopeless right now. I don’t really wanna go to college because I barely remember anything from high school. I want to make decent money but I have no clue what I want to get into. 

All of my old friends are going to college but I don’t wanna go because I don’t want to rack up a bunch of useless debt if I drop out. I always get extremely overwhelmed with the amount of work I get now and usually just say to myself “I can’t do this. “ and close it all up. 

I hate to admit it but I’ve honestly been just lazy as fuck but I know If I don’t figure out what I wanna do, there is a huge possibility that I could end up on the streets. At this point, I don’t know anymore. I feel like I could be going through another small depressive episode but I literally don’t have time for that right now. My brother committed suicide back in October and I miss him a lot. When he was here, I was motivated to be an ultrasound technician. I realized though that the healthcare field is not for me at all since the schooling for it is extremely hard. 

I also live in a small city so there really isn’t many opportunities and I don’t even know where to start. I’m sorry this all over the place, I just really didn’t even know where to begin. 

I also forgot to add that I have been looking at different carrier options but nothing has sparked my interest. My parents have about $18000saved up in a college account but I just don’t wanna get into classes for something and be completely un interested and drop out. I just wish I could be in my bed foreverrrrrrr. 

UPDATE:So lately I am honestly very proud to say that I have been doing extremely well. I still have not been smoking at all and I’ve still been attending my drug counseling/ therapy appointments weekly. I am very proud to also say that I have been excelling pretty well in school. Quarter grades closed yesterday and my lowest grade is an 83%!!! All of my other grades are in the high 90’s. I also got into a local two year school and everything is completely covered by grants which is amazing. I met my advisor this week and I have to take a placement test for both math and English, but she assured me that both are pretty short. I’m going for Business Management- Human Resources. After I achieve my associates, I’m going to go to my other community college to finish my bachelors since I still have the college fund. I’ve always loved everything about business and I already have a good amount of experience in it. We started a shirt business at my school and I started off as just the CFO but I got promoted to CEO this week!!! My teacher let me know that this would be amazing on my resume. I plan to stay connected with both teachers from the class because they are extremely successful in business, have a lot of connections, and they love me!!! Does anyone have any suggestions on what the job outlook is for this degree, and should I change my minor education to something more “useful”.

findapath,passed over for promotion,"Had no support during childhood, feeling lost with everything - what should I do?","My parents were emotionally extremely immature people, who grew up in completely uneducated families. I was born exceptionally intelligent (99.9th percentile), but no one really noticed. I taught myself how to learn at 3, went to my sister's school instead of kindergarten because I was bored, but that was about it when it comes to specially educating me. It was a small town in rural Hungary, teachers didn't really notice or knew what to do with it. 

My mother raised me not to become an adult man but her plush toy. I was ostracized, never made guy friends, eventually became gay which still very much feels like a twisted reaction to never getting to belong where I wanted to.

My family really fell apart with bloody scenes and my parents completely disregarding the needs of me and my sister when I was 11. I moved to a different city to go to high school there as an excuse to get away. Started doing drugs when I was 15, missed a lot of school, though was almost always passing with the highest grades, so no one really gave a fuck. 

I never learned how to study though, so fist semester of med school I dropped out. My drug use was becoming problematic too in legal ways. I chose psychology instead, not because I thought about it that much, but because I feared I couldn't tell my parents I'm dropping out without a plan B. 

It eventually took 6 years to finish this 3 year bachelor's, because I started doing everything else instead, got into legal trouble with drugs once again, isolated, couldn't make friends anyways because I was so different both on the intelligence level and both in term of lived experiences and never having learned any followable scripts and roles. I took out around $22000 with nothing to show for it.

I worked for a political party as a graphic designer, then a general communications person. With this experience and a Google UX design cert I could get a digital marketing communications job (web development project management) while still a student, but I couldn't work as an intern anymore when I was no longer a student. 

I liked working there because of the environment and community, but I was still debilitatingly lonely every day. I didn't want the political job (municipal level) because I couldn't really make friends there, I felt like I was missing out once again on being where 'everyone else is'. After more than a year of unsuccessful job hunts, through connections I got a job, digital account manager at a creative agency. 

I quit after half a year because the environment was toxic (this wasn't just my evaluation of the place, although admittedly some could better tolerate it). I also felt heavily underpaid for what I brought to the table in term of my capabilities, and they denied any potential for promotion even though I was training more senior staff. 

So the theme is this. I feel bitter and sad and unmotivated all the time because no choice in my life was truly mine. I never got to do anything that I truly wanted, make friends of hobbies, which make my life empty and unmotivating. Any job that I find I despise because it's never even just remotely what I wanted to do, I see everyone else having the most amount of fun, while I feel like I can't join them most of the time, because my thoughts and emotions are so dark and negative due to all of this, and I don't have the sort of typical things in life people connect over. 

I have no drive to push forward. I'm medicated for ""ADHD"" which at this point is just about keeping me going while I have no real reason or motivation to do so, and to keep me from spiraling so bad that I kill myself.

I'll probably start working with the politicians again as a quantitative analyst. I won't make much, like I probably won't be able to afford a therapist, my own place, or a dog - things that would probably make me feel better. It makes me even angrier that I never got to do what I wanted to, and I'm in this shitty place where I can't afford anything due to never having gotten a good degree, a stable background. And on top of this, I gotta pay my student loans.

The tough part is about how to live without despising it all? I know I should just take the job I'm offered, gain experience, hold on and see how it gets better. But it's so fucking bad every day that I wake up every day feeling sad, mad, angry, furious, desperate, and most of the time end up wanting to kill myself even before I get out if bed.

I'm really interested in medicine, I still spend the majority of my time researching topics, like supplements and drugs, mostly psychiatric, which I recognize was probably always an attempt at curing myself. I applied for a master's in psychology where I'd choose a cognitive- neuropsychology minor. I just can't see how I would be able to make anything out of this. While also actually making money. Becoming a therapist sounds like a joke, because even though I know I have what it takes cognitively and empathy-wise, maybe even knowledge, I'm so all over the place that it'd be a joke for others to rely on me. Plus I guess I wouldn't want the loneliness that comes with it. I can't see how any other directions would allow me to afford a living. I guess if I combined it with the quantitative analyst skills, which will include python, R, power BI etc., it could be useful somewhere like a pharma company? But even then, I feel like getting a job with the sort of mix and match CV and my life being a mess is near impossible.

findapath,passed over for promotion,Looking for a better future. Should I go back to school for a second bachelors in finance/accounting/economics at 29 with a wife and baby?,"Hello all,

I’m 29 years old and desperately looking for a way to execute career change to set myself up for a better career and a better future for my young family. 

Since sept. of 2019 after graduating with a history degree with a public administration/policy analysis minor in spring 2019 from TCNJ in New Jersey, I’ve been working construction/installation side for a commercial solar company.  While the money has been great for the most part (prevailing wage most of the year), the job is grueling (including extremely early mornings, weather, small company so weird social structure, commuting all over the state constantly, not much mobility) and I don’t see myself/want to be continuing down this path in the long term. I’ve been here 5 years now and have been passed up for opportunities to move into the electrical work and training, although I’ve been promoted to machine operator and do less physical labor compared to previous years with higher pay. Overall the job has been good in terms of compensation but that is it, and I find the work unfulfilling, monotonous, and insecure due to both layoffs and my own lack of interest/proficiency in the general field of construction. I’d very much like to begin a career in the financial/economic fields as soon as I can, but don’t know the best way to do so. 

About me:

Again, I’m a 29 year old man with a wife and baby girl who I love more than anything. I come from a very solid/stable family including my parents and two sisters. I’ve always been very inquisitive with keen interests in understanding underlying structures/phenomena in the world, with history as my main academic passion. I attended college at first pursuing an environmental science degree, but after struggling and doing poorly with chemistry and biology, transferred to history where I did much better in terms of internships and grades (Holocaust museum internship, published writings as a student, 3.2 gpa at graduation). In my years after school while working this job, I’ve come to gain much more interest in and self-educated on topics of economics/finance as the driving force behind history and how the contemporary world operates today behind pretty much all geopolitical events/commerce/politics/ etc.  To add as well, I see how those in these fields get first hand interaction with how world events transpire, and engage with these larger systems at play while making a good income. After a few years of working a construction job with little future prospects in sight coupled with the new found responsibility of being a father and wanting to find something worth putting the time and effort into pursuing,  finance/economic-adjacent roles which allow would expose me to these fields of interest is my goal.

 My father retired last year at 66 from a very successful and lucrative career as a financial and investment advisor/wealth manager at Morgan Stanley. He tells me that it’s not necessary to return for a second bachelors and that experience is more attractive to employers and big financial firms than simply education. However besides wanting a more structured and informative base in these subjects that have come to interest me more after college these past few years, I have no formal background or experience through which to gain entry into these roles. I feel like my father comes from an older generation during which any degree could get you in this type of business, but the couple of friends in finance I have say a finance/business degree is more prioritized to gain access to these job fields now. 

The past year has been very tough as I’ve realized I need to make a drastic change in life for my family’s future. There’s been a lot of shame and beating myself up over not having the foresight at a younger age to use the stability/privilege I had in life to set myself up for a better future. It’s led to immense anxiety, regret at taking the easier route (an easier degree, partying and smoking with friends over the years, not planning well), and depression that has been hard on my wife and first year of my family life. I know it will be a hard road but I’d rather work to achieve this change now than live with regret later on of having not made this change now. I have ideas of dream job roles I know about that include working with investments, hedge funds, global macro fund management, commodity trading, investment banking, FP&A, etc.  It’s truly become my dream to be someone whose work entails observing geopolitical world events/economic trends/market behaviors and working with others to make investments and income from engaging with these factors. 

Nothing will make me happier than to know, regardless of how hard the work might be or how long it takes, that what I’m doing is best for my family’s future, stability, and well being in the long run by pursuing a career I have more interest in as well as can do well financially in.  I know it’s unlikely that I’ll end up in some elite top finance or economic role at BlackRock or vanguard or become a CFO somewhere, but I haven’t lost hope that I can make something more of my future and find a way to do so now while I have a support system. My family and wife encourage me to make a move towards a better future that I desperately want and support me in various ways. When I talked about (before later deciding against due to lack of interest) pursuing law school or a comp sci./tech degree, they encouraged me. Although I’ve done fine with income these past few years and have some solid savings, living at my parents with my family while working for a couple years while I pursue this is an option we’ve discussed, and my family even says they would help me with tuition for another degree. I have all these opportunities now at my disposal to build a better future. Although it’s a privilege I feel stupid for not taking advantage of earlier, I want this change for a better future so bad now that I don’t want to waste this opportunity that I’m extremely lucky to still have. I just want to know if it’s practical to take this risk or if there are other ways to go in order to achieve these goals. 

So I ask, is it worth beginning a second finance or related degree at 29, and probably finishing by the time I’m 31-32? Will my age disqualify me from most good starting positions and therefore make a good financial career/future in this field too difficult to get? I’m not sure if an MBA is the best choice as I have 0 financial education/experience to draw from, so is getting this second bachelors degree the best way for me to start this career journey? Is it practical to look for internship to gain experience while doing this? If I put my all into this over these new couple years and do well will financial firms be open to someone at my age entering the field? Given my circumstance and desires for a career, are there other titles or fields of study you would recommended? What skills such as data analytics or programming supplement a finance or related degree to make someone more appealing to employers in investment funds/wealth management/financial firms? 

Has anyone who’s been in a similar situation in life or is currently in these fields who can give some insight? I’m sorry for the long post, but I truly would love some advice on how to approach this giant change for the better in my life from people who can offer guidance.

I am a 29 year old male turning 30 in a few months, still living with parents ( I do pay some rent) and working a retail job in a supermarket where I’ve been at for five years which I hate more and more every year I work there, I hate interacting with customers who treat me like I’m subhuman, I don't get along with my colleagues most of whom treat me like a idiot, they can be very condescending and patronising to me and don’t teach me or get me to do tasks which other people are trained in and get to do much quicker than me even though they’ve only been there a few months. Also the work mostly consists of putting food on shelves which I find dull, unengaging and unfulfilling and am just overall tired of the work and the people. 

I don’t have a degree, I tried university at 26 and picked Film Production since at the time movies were my passion and I wanted to work in the film industry, unfortunately not only did I struggle with collaboration but my mental health problems which I had for years (depression anxiety and suspected borderline personality disorder by a mental health professional) and I had to drop out only a couple months in which was unfortunate since I loved the independence. I also don’t have a car and currently doing driving lessons though I did pass my theory time. The only qualification I have is a BTEC Extended Diploma in Uniformed Public Services which I only got as I did lots of research and putting stuff in my own words, I do feel I did a couple decent essays though. I however don’t have any GCSEs since I went to a special education school which didn’t do any GCSEs. I had to go Special ed since I had an overactive imagination in primary school and barely paid attention to the point I fell behind and was also ostracized and picked on by the other kids (both recurring themes in my life).  I have tried things, such as coding and environmental science but sucked at maths and also tried a photography business but I quit that for filmmaking (never had much skill in photography anyway and took terrible photos). Also tried environmental science, enjoyed and did well with the environmental and science stuff but sucked at maths which killed the course for me.

Anyway I am dumb as a rock with no skills, abilities and not good at ANYTHING, despite reading many books and watching arthouse movies I suspect I’m close to illiterate. Not to mention I am very, VERY socially inept with no social skills, I struggle to socialise and cannot have conversations and no idea how to start conversations, this of course means I have a few relationships and can’t meet new people. I do believe I am fundamentally a stupid person, even feeling like one of the dumbest people alive, validated by overhearing people calling me “spastic”, “retard” behind my back several times throughout my life as well as infantising me and talking down to me as well as overall being condescending. Although I am dumb I am sick of being treated like this!

I do believe I am good at researching, making lists, certain problem solving and I’ve always had an overactive imagination. I do enjoy writing, both fiction and essays and enjoy working with ideas, words and sometimes data. I love trying out my own ideas and choosing what work I do. I would like a career where I could develop some skills and abilities and be somewhat engaging or at least more engaging than stocking shelves. I also enjoy walking about and discovering new places. I have some passion for the environment

I will say I am very, very unhappy with my life and have been for years. I feel like I’m trapped and am never going to succeed in life or achieve anything or amount to anything because I’m just so thick and incompetent. I’m going to be 30 years old and still living with my parents and I’m embarrassed about that. I want to travel to countries like Japan, Thailand, Greenland, Iceland, I want to see the aurora borealis and somehow see an orca out in the wild. I want to get good at martial arts. I’ve already missed out on university, did not have a normal school life, never had a girlfriend, no accomplishments or anything to be proud of and have barely any good memories or done anything most people my age had experienced or achieved. I’ve worked in retail for five years and got nothing to show for it, anything I tried in-between: film production at university, coding, environmental science, writing stories, a photography business I failed at. Even when I trained martial arts at college/high school I sucked at it. I feel like a incompetent doofus who was just born to not achieve anything and be a thing to be made fun of. When I die, whether in a death bed or lying on cardboard in a street I know I’d have lived a very unfulfilled life as I already feel like I do. Things are just very dire for me and I have been suicidal for a long time, even planned it last year but couldn’t. Only thing I can do is weight train and I have gained some strength and muscle over the years. 

I know I’m very different from most people, I feel subhuman and I don’t belong anywhere, like I don’t belong in the same species as everyone else. 

Despite being lazy and indecisive all year last year aside from weight training, reading and driving lessons. I have considered multiple careers; a writer, journalist, a career in marketing, archivist, data analyst, translation. All careers I have some interest in although I doubt I could do due to my lack of intelligence (also the AI problem, I’ve already written off Proofreading). I know many job opportunities may open up when I get a car. So maybe a location scout or something involving travelling. Perhaps I’ll just end up as a cleaner just like in the book/film I’m Thinking of Ending Things.

I’m open to trying university again IF it’s the right course though I’d rather do an apprenticeship or go entry level and work up as I hate the classroom environment (due to the other students, but I do enjoy learning) .

Finally, DO NOT, RECOMMEND, THE TRADES, THEY. ARE. NOT. FOR ME. especially considering my mental health issues.

findapath,passed over for promotion,Feeling extremely lost and can't find my way.,"Feel free to delete if this is the wrong spot\*\*

I apologize in advance for the book. I don't have a TL:DR for ya, unfortunately.

I needed to find somewhere to post my thoughts and this seemed like a good place. I need advice, because I just...I don't know where to go from here or what my path should be. (A tough question for anyone, because our individual paths are our own,) I'm feeling extremely overwhelmed, very lost and I just don't know where to go next, what to do next, nor how I can make a success of things.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

So, hello. I'm a 43 yr old gay male, living in Montana.

I struggle with multiple health issues, a good deal of which are invisible. Yet somehow, my appearance is that of a 20-something year old (thank goodness for small favors! Even if I am Quasimodo levels of ugly.)

I have had 2 major open-heart surgeries in my lifetime - the 1st as a 15 year old, the 2nd one back in 2020. I have both a pacemaker and an artificial heart valve that will require me to be on blood thinners for the remainder of my lifetime.

I was born with poor hearing and poor eyesight, and some barely noticeable bodily deformities (eyes don't sit quite right, little fingers won't straighten out, etc.)

I was born with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome / Effect, but am fairly high-functioning, but often struggle with adulting. I may be 43 chronologically, but I'm 15-18 mentally. (Tested) I was born with a heart defect -- a small hole in one of the valves of my heart.

In the last few years leading up to 2020, I began experiencing severe dizzy episodes, and it all came to a head several months after my 2nd surgery ---- I had a severe vertigo attack and afterwards, my hearing got even worse, and the dizziness / vertigo got worse and worse. Finally went to an ENT and after a few months, was diagnosed with Meniere's Disease.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I've been through many jobs in my lifetime and now the Meniere's is making keeping work even harder.

Last month, I lost a retail job I'd picked up earlier in the year, and I did so well with them, they promoted me within 3 months of working there -- my first ever promotion anywhere. (I'd had too many call-outs due to being unable to come in due to the dizziness, or having to go home.) Thankfully, if I chose, they would let me re-apply in 6 months.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I immediately signed up to be an UberEats driver because I didn't know how long it would be before I found something else. I live in the largest city in MT and I'm running out of places to apply. Thankfully, it's keeping me afloat and able to pay my bills.

(I'm currently on Housing and Medicaid.)

On top of that, my family just moved to Frisco, TX and want me to follow along when I'm able to. But I don't know when -- or if -- that's even feasible for me right now.

I don't have any college behind me, and I don't know that I could afford it and I'd rather not wait 4-5 years to follow my family. My foster mother is getting up there in years, and I want to spend whatever time I can near her. (My own birth mother passed several years ago this month.)

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I don't really have any friends, I'm mostly a loner / shut-in when I'm not working. I'm single. 

I often deal with severe depression that I'm on medication for (due to the heart issues, I have my own freaking pharmacy in my bathroom)

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Since losing my job, I've really been struggling to find my way and I don't know what I can do anymore. I don't know where to turn or how I can tear myself out of this....trap...I'm in.

At the beginning of the year, I lost Medicaid temporarily because I was making too many hours at work and I was starting the process of getting signed up with my job's benefits so that I could get myself comfortably off Medicaid and still be able to make money.

And then I woke up one morning, in the middle of a severe vertigo attack and had to call in. My store manager called me later that day to let me know she had to let me go. (I'd been pulled into the office about a month before to talk about the situation, so it's not like I didn't know. I'd been trying to make all my shifts and hopefully dig myself out of that hole. Alas.)

I didn't want to lose that job because they were the first job I'd ever had that SAW something in me worth promoting me for, and from everything I'd heard from them, I'd been doing a bang-up job after the promotion.

But this damn Meniere's...just...ugh.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I don't know what my path moving forward should be. I'm just...so very lost right now.

The fact that I'm on Medicaid and Housing is freaking killing me --- I desperately WANT to be able to support myself on my own. I'd LOVE to own my own home, pay for my own medical bills, etc.

But with my health issues, I'm being forced to recognize that I really, REALLY need Medicaid. I've had a few hospital stays since my 2020 operation and Medicaid paid for it all.

In order to stay on Medicaid, I'm told that I can only work a certain number of hours a week. If I work over 23.5 hours a week, I get kicked off the program.

Having Meniere's is making it even worse. I can't guarantee that I'll always be able to make shifts. If I have a bad attack, and even being a little dizzy, it's unsafe to drive, or operate certain machinery. Sure, I can ask to go sit in a break room until I feel better, but if the attack worsens while I'm at work, I could fall and hurt myself or worse, cause an embarrassing, dramatic scene. (The one time I had a bad episode at work, my manager wanted to call an ambulance. I had to come clean about the Meniere's and explain that I just needed to get an Uber home before the vomiting started.)

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I feel so....so trapped.

My family keeps telling me that I should apply for SSDI, and I probably should, but I desperately want to prove to myself that I CAN make this work on my own, that I CAN beat my heart issues, that I CAN beat the Meniere's, that I CAN drag myself out of poverty. 

Being on Medicaid is great for my health, yeah, but I also feel like I'm being forced to stay in poverty just so I can continue qualifying.

I want to be able to make my own way, so badly.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

The fact that rent EVERYWHERE is so bad right now, that even if I did make this move to Texas, I'd be forced to reapply for Housing or worse -- get roommates.

It really scares me that I may not be able to rent somewhere making 15/17$ an hour, even if I got off Medicaid and worked full time somehow.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I'm sorry for the long-ass post, but I've been racking my brains for the last week about what I could try and do (I am of course, job-hunting in the meantime) and the knowledge I need to be earning WELL over 20$ an hour to even THINK about getting out of poverty is sending me absolutely spiraling. 

I want to cry so badly.

Maybe I should just finally accept that this is my new reality. Maybe I should just get myself on SSDI, on disability and accept that my health has to come first, even if it means giving my dreams up. Even if it means that I have to stop trying to dig my way out of poverty.

I don't know what to do. I don't know where to turn. I want OUT of this trap.

But I can't be an actor. I'm afraid my writing isn't good enough to publish books or stories with. I'm an artist, but again, nothing worth being sold. I'm a solid gamer, but I can't see myself being a popular YouTuber. I can't sing.

I have a solid background in retail and fast-food. I don't have any other skills worth over $20/hr. Heart condition / pacemaker prevents me from working around machinery.  
  
I desperately want to break past this ceiling I've slammed into and I feel like I'm throwing myself against all the walls in order to try and break free.   
  
I'm free...  
  
...and yet, I feel I'm trapped in an invisible, tiny, glass prison.

findapath,workplace discrimination,"Looking for a country where I can survive and stay — psychology graduate from Asia with no formal job experience, considering migration and long-term settlement","Hi everyone. I’m from Asia, and I have a bachelor’s degree in psychology. I’m 28 years old and unfortunately I don’t have formal job experience. I’ve done creative work in the past, mostly freelance art-related projects that I can’t really present as “professional experience” on a resume.

I’ve been trying to find a way to leave my country — permanently, if possible. I struggle with serious social and psychological issues here, including bullying culture, toxic workplace behavior, and deeply ingrained gender stereotypes.
There is also no real support system, and discrimination — both gender-based and class-based — is part of daily life. I honestly feel like I cannot survive long-term in my home country — emotionally, mentally, and even physically.

I’m looking for advice on where I might be able to study (e.g., a psychology-related master’s degree), find a stable job after graduation, and eventually settle down — possibly even naturalize. I’m open to giving up my citizenship if that’s what it takes. I just want a life where I can work, heal, and hopefully contribute. I don’t want to be sent back.

My dream is to study medicine or clinical psychology and eventually become a counselor or therapist — a clinical psychologist, psychotherapist, counseling psychologist, etc. But I understand the path is long and expensive, and I’m open to more practical or realistic options (like HR, health education, school or community mental health jobs) if they help me survive and stay.

I know that in many countries, you need to meet a minimum income threshold (e.g., €55,000 or more) to get a work visa or permanent residency, which is very difficult for international students in psychology, education, or social work. I’m doing my best to research which countries actually offer a realistic path to stay — and not just study and be kicked out.

I’ve considered medicine, but graduate-entry medicine seems rare or extremely expensive in most countries. Even if I passed the exams, I might not be able to afford it. I’ve also heard that medical school is so intense that part-time work is nearly impossible, which is hard for someone with limited savings and chronic health issues.

I’m willing to put in the work. I’m willing to learn hard languages (French, German, Dutch, etc.) if it gives me a better chance of survival. I just want a country where I’m not treated as disposable — where the healthcare is decent, the waiting times are manageable, and there isn’t a strong culture of sexism or racial discrimination, especially against women.

If anyone knows of a country, degree program, or realistic career route that could help someone like me survive and build a future, I’d be deeply grateful for your advice.

Thank you so much.

findapath,sexist jokes at work,"As a woman in IT, I developed a fear of working in this industry ","


I feel like every corporate job is a form of slavery, and I can’t find the motivation to work.

I’ve been in IT for about 7 years, including my studies.

When I found my first corporate job, I was excited. It was a large global company, and I felt very responsible and proud of myself for working in one of the most prestigious corporations.

Unfortunately, there was constant pressure to deliver results. My supervisor always demanded more from me, and since I was young, I gave my all at work. I worked overtime because finishing the task was more important to me than failing.

Unfortunately, later on, I was laid off due to the IT crisis as the company was cutting costs.

My subsequent jobs were better, but there was always this anxiety that I had to meet deadlines week after week. Since I started working, I've lost half of my hair.

Because of these experiences, I began to hate my job and my profession. I quit my job because I would open my laptop and feel completely empty inside.

When programming applications for an IT company, I feel like my work means nothing because the bosses can decide to remove my code and rewrite it from scratch, even if I’ve been working on it for months.

I open job portals and browse open job positions , feeling anxious that work means being condemned to constant deadlines, anxiety, complaints about why something isn't done faster, and the need to revise the same code multiple times.

I’m afraid of ending up with an authoritarian team leader. I fear that my failures will again be explained by the fact that I’m a woman and supposedly less capable.

I’ve gotten to know this environment over several years, and I’ve gotten the impression that a large portion of men are hidden misogynists.

I’ve developed an aversion to working with men and a fear that they will judge me based on my gender, forcing me to prove my competence at every step.

And I don’t have the strength for that anymore. I don’t have the strength to encounter men again who tell sexist jokes and then deny it and gaslight me by saying I’m overreacting and too sensitive. My psyche can’t handle going through that again.

I’m afraid of ending up with people who won’t consider my opinions, who will dismiss my ideas, and I dread the thought of having to fight for my dignity again.

The last few years of my work have been about proving my competence and defending myself from men’s jokes. 90% of the people I worked with were men.

I’ve been unemployed for several months  because I’m afraid of ending up in a company where it will all repeat itself.

I had one experience where a male recruiter mocked me and my skills. That was a few years ago, when I was a junior and couldn’t answer all the questions.

I feel like I’m being treated unfairly. I hardly have any social life because I dedicated all my studies to a career in IT, and after work, I keep learning because I hate not knowing something.

But despite this, I feel that no one believes in my abilities and that men have it easier in this profession because they have colleagues they trust more. Men don’t trust women in a male-dominated profession.

And I no longer have the strength to constantly prove at work that I’m capable. They feel very confident, while I have doubts every time. I feel that if I make a mistake, they’ll think I’m stupid, but if a man makes a mistake, it’s just a minor error.

Working in IT has cost me too much stress, and I’ve found that people lack empathy. I felt like a doormat, given the worst tasks while my colleagues got the more important ones.

Even now, when I’m at home studying, there’s a thought in my head that it’s pointless because I’ll never be good enough. I’ll always be a corporate slave. How can I deal with this?

My dream is to release and monetize my own application, but I don’t even have the strength to do that because I need to earn money. Working from 9 to 5 leaves me exhausted, and I don’t have the energy to code after work or even look at a laptop.

findapath,ask for a raise,Guilty of wasting my 20s,"Long post but basically need help. 

As an introduction I am 28 years old currently doing my level 2 electrical installation course to become an electrician. I am at a private course, they do it faster than college. This is a one year college course but I'm doing it in 7 weeks. Im at week 6 now so almost finished. 

Background. 
It took me a long time to realise what the problem was but I grew up extremely malnurished. I was raised on a lacto vegetarian diet until 20 and then became vegan at age 20-27 years. I have been eating meat, eggs and fish for about 7 months now. I am starting to feel a lot better already with the main benefits being brain fog being lifted. I struggled with intense brain fog through late teens and most of my 20s and now most of it is finally going away. 

I didn't know the problem was diet because of religion. I was raised on a lacto vegetarian diet because I was raised Sikh and then when veganism became popular I jumped on it mainly because I had acne and noticed if I switched milk with almond milk my acne would improve. 

I grew up with Indian Punjabi parents, I am British Indian. When I was 17 years old I was doing my AS levels I got Ds and Es and I wanted to do an apprenticeship or just go into the workforce after that but my father forced me to retake my a-levels. I retook my AS levels at a private school. My parents could afford it because my father is a multimillionaire. I failed again because of stress. My stress levels got so high my hair turned white. Still have white hair now because of it. 

I would get stressed because my father would threaten to kill me if I didn't get good grades and become a scholar, that was really important to him. He would also humiliate me Infront of the teachers calling me a retard for not trying my best when I was. 

After I failed my AS retake levels at 18 years old I wanted to do an apprenticeship but my father said that an apprenticeship is shameful and only the lower class trash do apprenticeships. He made me retake them again. I was doing my AS levels the first time and got my results in 2014, then retook them in 2015. 

In 2015 my father forced me to retake them again but this time it was for 2 years because now AS and A2 levels were done at end of second year. I failed again because of stress. I also was heavily addicted to porn. I became heavily addicted to internet porn after I failed my AS levels the first time because I left all my friends. I lied to my friends saying I was leaving because I wanted to go to a better school. All my friends in secondary school got good AS level results.  I lied because I was ashamed. 

I went to a prestigous secondary school but was ranked near the bottom of the barrel each year despite me trying my best. Around 120/130 each year. I got 5As, 2Bs and 3Cs during GCSE. The entry requirements to do A-levels in my sixth form was 4As and 2Bs, I just got by but that was i think for students only in my school because a bunch of other students from other schools came too and when I asked everyone they all said As and A*s. I think I was one of the lowest ranked academic performers in the whole school. 

I lost all my friends after i left school. That's what lead my porn addiction to get really bad. I got intense brain fog and acne but I only found out when I was 27 that most of the brain fog was actually caused by my diet, my religious upbringing prevented me from accessing that information. 

I spent 4 years doing my A-levels when A-levels are a 2 year course and still failed. I failed because of porn addiction and stress and constant death threats by my father. 

The fear would become so intense my whole entire body would shake and I find it difficult to leave the house. This wasn't fear, this was terror. I was being terrorised my whole body would shake and tremble in fear. 

I would later find out that when my father was in India he was a terrorist and is banned for life from going back because he was the leader of a terrorist organisation. No surprise since I had suicidal thoughts when I was a kid and engaged in self harm. He also tried to kill my mom and I was born out of rape. 

I am 20 years old now and I have now become deeply insecure, lonely and abandoned because I retook my A-levels twice and failed. All my friends went uni and I was left behind. 

I was so insecure I would go downstairs in the office on my computer at home and apply for jobs. When I would see a job that I wanted I would see it would require good a-levels I would run back into my room and tremble in fear, I was that scared. I would distract myself from my emotions by watching movies. 

I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life anymore so I thought maybe become an accountant. My dad knew an accountant. I worked part time for 3 months then quit because I hated it and then my father would send me to an educational accounting company that would train you on accounting software. This was for 6 months. After completing it I didn't get the confidence to get a job, when I applied for jobs they basically said this was fake work experience because I wasn't getting paid and the vat return wasn't real. 

I was also doing my AAT qualifications and did AAT level 1 and 2 at college but then the college decided to stop doing the course so I left. 

My father sent me to another educational accounting company that did the same thing for 6 months. I was learning the same thing again. Same thing happened and I wasted another 6 months in the same position in life. 

I then applied for a traineeship. I was supposed to work there for free for 1 months and then I get a full time job. Didn't provide and exploited me for 6 months. 

I would then get onto self improvement and read books, my father didn't like seeing me improve myself and said I was demonically possessed for building self confidence and sent me to a psychiatrist and drugged me with high doses of a drug called quitiapine, an antipsychotic medication. The drugs sedated me and gave me intense depression, suicidal thoughts and took all my feelings away. I couldn't feel anything anymore. Turned into a zombie. 

My dad said I should stay the same person and that making changes to myself means Im a demon. He would also always tell me to constantly doubt myself. 

I felt lost and directionless in life. I remember applying for part time jobs here and there. Got a job as a waiter, pizza delivery driver and a bookkeeper but mostly very short term only a few months long with the longest being as a waiter for 1 year. The reason why I wasnt working full time was because of shame. My father said it's shameful getting a low ranking job and I would feel fear identifying myself as a pizza delivery driver or waiter or bookkeeper long term, I realised now that's stupid. 

I wanted to move out my parents house when I was in my early 20s and learn financial independance but my father would ban me and threaten to kill me multiple times. I said I wanted to live in an apartment or shared accomodation and he said I'm not allowed. He said I can only leave the house when I get married and that I should save up for a house after getting a job. 

My father bought me a car so I can drive but when I first learnt how to drive I was always scared because my father would always terrorise me. 

My father also said it's shameful to get a girlfriend because according to him all girlfriends are whores and prostitutes and that only a wife is worth having. 

Once I started eating meat, eggs and fish 7 months ago I can't understand how I allowed all that time to pass. I have never had a full time job and I am 28 years old now. Hopefully I get one after this course. 

Felt like I just woke up from a bad dream. I was blind and now I can see. I started to feel guilty and remorse because I cared so little about my life I didn't bother to get a full time job. I didn't believe in myself, didn't believe I could get one so barely tried. 

There were times where I felt like a loser because I had no money but my father said he is ok in me asking him for money and being dependant on him and then would attack me for saying I'm broke. He said I'm a millionaire even when I am not because he is one. He would then praise how amazing it is to live with your parents and that leaving your parents is evil unless you are married. 

After changing my diet I feel like I am no longer in a mental trance anymore. I don't know where all that time went. All I remember is doing qigong, kundalni awakening and that's it. Maybe some other stuff but can't remember. 

I did also set up an online business to help people improve their eyesight naturally but only got one sale and that was for £25 for some coaching. 

My father also felt sorry for me and gave me a real estate business in 2022 and was making £5k a month but then he decided he wanted the money to come to him and he is having it until I get married. He said I don't deserve it because I'm not married. The company is legally in my name. 

Anyone who is close with my family has the same problems. 

My brother is same as me but 2 years younger. 
One of my mothers friend is British Indian and has been unemployed for 7 years. 
A close friend of my father's an architect, his son only left the house when he was 40 and that was only because he got married. All British Indian. 

I am making this post to connect with someone because I haven't had social contact with anyone for years. 

Any help would be much appreciated. I just feel guilty at wasting time but when I look back I was mentally incapacitated. I tried my best but didn't have the will to fight anymore because my father beat me down so much. 

Edit:
Forgot to mention that I went to India 3 times and would always go to the hospital for anemia but they didn't say it was due to diet, they just said they didn't know what caused it. I also got a seizure and died too and paramedics had to revive me, this was in UK and I think this was the drugs. 

When I was vegan I knew a British Indian woman and she got sent to hospital for anemia too, she was vegan. Met her at a vegan festival. She didn't go to eating meat, she still believes being vegan is healthy. 

Update 22/07/25
I also forgot to mention my father's ideology, aura and belief systems mimic almost verbatim of the Pakistani Muslim grooming gangs in the UK where a group of Pakistani Muslim men would rape young white girls and get away with it. Even how they got away with it using money and power. It feels almost identical. 

E.g. my father believes all white women are trash whores.
He has a history of terrorism and violence. 
Uses blackmail to manipulate people 

A lot of weird stuff like that. 
He also gives off a very strong pedo energy like a child molester. ",11,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1m5ux03/guilty_of_wasting_my_20s/,1753131717.0,Hercules-789,1m5ux03,advice_seeking
findapath,ask for a raise,"23M — Feeling completely lost in life, no guidance, no direction. What’s going on here?","I’m a 23-year-old guy and lately I’ve just been overwhelmed. Life feels like a giant mess — money, careers, survival, power games, hate, poverty… it’s all so much. I look around and I’m just like: *what is going on here?*

I was raised without any responsible adult around to really talk to me or guide me. No one to ask things like how to navigate life, emotions, or even basic stuff. And honestly, most people in my community either didn’t care or ended up using me for something.

I’ve been spending time talking with ChatGPT to try and analyze myself and the world, which has helped a bit — but honestly, I still feel incredibly lost. Like I’m floating with no anchor.

I don’t know what I'm asking exactly, but I guess… how do people figure things out? How do you find a direction when it feels like you were never even given a map? Is anyone else going through this?

Any advice or even just someone to relate would mean a lot right now.

findapath,ask for a raise,Lost In Life - Looking For Direction,"I, 23M, feel lost in life. I've been working in the grocery industry for close to 10 years now, from bagger to grocery manager and all the in between for 3 different companies. Company 1 paid 11.25/h and I was with them for 3 years. Company 2 paid Min. wage (7.25/h) and I spent only a year and a half there, and Company 3 is now 16.50/h, and I've been with them for 4 years now with only one raise. TL:DR Job order; Company 1: Bagger -> Cashier -> Produce Clerk -> CSR (Customer Service Rep.) -> CSM (Customer Service Manager) -> Front End Manager / Company 2: Key Holder/Stocking Clerk / Company 3: Nighttime Clerk -> Nighttime Grocery Manager. I'm getting burnt out and depressed due to heavy load and picking up the slack of lazy co-workers. After employment at the first company, I took a year and half of college and then dropped out due to covid making classes difficult to attend and financial constraints. Shortly after I started employment at the second company, but soon found it to be very soul sucking and with a mix of a terrible boss and wild hours (6 - 60 hour weeks), I had had enough and left. Found employment at the third company which treated me well with good benefits, but still didn't feel as fulfiling as it used to when I was a teen. As more time went on and some position changes, days went on and blended into one another. Some days were heavy, some were easy, but most just felt mundane and empty. I'm really good working with my hands and I have an aptitued for technology, plus I love to work in general. I'm not really the type that likes to sit down and do nothing, but every once in a while is nice, like a video game binge to ease the stress. Heck, I even built my own custom PC with a watercooling loop and mods to the gpu and cpu heat plates, and I feel so proud of it. But lately I've been finding myself wanting to spend more time with my girlfriend, and with our current work schedule I only get to see her when she gets home from work and 2 days a week when we both have some time off. I really want to find a job that allows for me to have weekends off that works during the day, since nightshift has absolutly tanked my mentality. I've read into electrician apprenticeships cause I have interests in the field, but I constantly discourage myself, and I mainly am scared to take a risk, since grocery work is all I've done and feel like I can do. I've never asked for help before, especially from strangers on the internet, but if there is any advice or direction I could be pointed in, I would really appreciate the help. Thank you. :)

findapath,ask for a raise,"Office job vs barista dream, feeling stuck and guilty","Hi, lurker here. I (25F) am looking for advice on how to move forward.

For most of my life, I’ve struggled to find something that truly interested me. I never had that “spark” that motivates some people to go above and beyond. Since I was a kid, I’ve lived with a “one day at a time” mentality. I ended up choosing a major without job prospects (I studied Sociology... not the wisest choice in a third-world country), and during university I worked in restaurants to support myself and my family.

It was during those jobs that I found myself working behind the drink bar, making coffee, and that’s when I found it: something that genuinely made me happy.

I worked as a barista for almost four years and got really damn good at it. The more I learned, the more I realized how I green I was. In the past, that kind of challenge would have overwhelmed me, make me drop everything on the sopt: but not this time. I pushed through, met amazing people, learned so many things. Even on the hardest days, in the most exploitative jobs (had a few lmao), I felt fulfilled.

For the first time in my life, I had a dream: to dedicate myself to the world of coffee.

But life got in the way.

This year, my longtime boyfriend and I are finally moving out together. My country is going through a rough economic moment, and barista work doesn’t pay enough, also its unreliable. My body was already suffering from the physical strain, especially at my last job, where I had to run up and down eight floors just to collect mugs left by office workers. (Still, this was the best job I've ever had)

A few months ago, my best friend told me about an opening in her office. She offered me the position. It was a tough decision but I figured that having a stable office job with better pay would help me move forward, get our own place, and maybe even get married next year.

I started working at the office a month ago. It’s not bad, and it’s not hard... but it’s depressing. Sitting in a cubicle, replying to emails all day, it just drains me. Still, the pay raise was significant, and if I pass the trial period, I’ll earn even more.

I told myself I’d do this for a while, save up, and maybe one day go back to coffee.

But today, by pure chance, I ran into the boss of my ex-boss. She told me they’re opening a new store, and they’ll be serving alcoholic drinks too—which got me really excited, since I’ve been wanting to learn mixology. I told her I left because of money, and she asked me to send my CV. Her boss wants to make me an offer.

And now I feel stuck.

I feel like I owe my friend this job. Technically, I took her place, she’s training me so she can move up in the company. If I leave now, she might get stuck until they find someone else reliable, and from what i've seen, getting into this company is \*hard\*. Getting the job was *hell,* the interview process was awful, the boss is a nightmare (thank god i relaly don't see her at all, she works at homeoffice and doesn't get involved in our department at all). But now I also have a shot at going back to something I actually love.

I know the coffee job would pay significantly less, as baristas aren’t well paid where I live. Also, it's not a simple job either, you have to make a lot of physical movement and I've had some leg injuries that make it really hard to stay standing for long periods of time. And I don’t want to let down my boyfriend either; we’ve both been working hard for a stable future.

I just feel so lost right now. I know I should at least hear the offer and see if it’s viable... but I’m scared of letting everyone down if I leave. And scared of letting *myself* down if I stay.

Any advice is appreciated.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1m9ivj1/office_job_vs_barista_dream_feeling_stuck_and/,1753499629.0,Zeldola,1m9ivj1,advice_seeking
findapath,ask for a raise,My Current Job Situation….,"Hello everyone, I'm 22 years old and have been working as a team member at a fast-food restaurant for almost two years. My current pay is only $10.30 an hour, after receiving just one 30-cent raise during my first year. When I asked my manager about this, I was told that raises are only given every 1.5 years, or every year for ""high performers,"" which they acknowledge I am.
This was supposed to be a temporary summer job, but it was convenient at the time, so I stayed. Now I realize the income is terrible for someone my age. The situation has gotten worse recently:
 * Expanded Duties, No Extra Pay: I've been trained and required to work every single position in the store, including tasks meant for managers and upper management, with no increase in pay. I've asked for a raise multiple times and have been rejected every time.
 * Drastic Hour Cuts: My hours have been cut from 10-hour shifts to 4-hour shifts because ""labor is high.""
 * Erratic Scheduling: Despite the reduced hours, I'm expected to have open availability. The schedules are nonsensical, with me being asked to come in at 5:00 AM for one shift and 8:00 PM for another.
 * Understaffing: The restaurant is severely understaffed. We often have only 3 people trying to run an entire busy location in Atlanta that serves over 800 customers a day. Management does nothing to hire more people and supervisors just yell at us for not keeping up.
Broken Promises and Feeling Used
The main reason I've stayed this long is because of the promise of a promotion.
Last September, they told me I would be promoted to Shift Manager. It is now nearly August of the following year, and they only began my training two weeks ago. It feels like they've been baiting me to keep me from quitting. Shortly after they promised me the role, they started hiring shift managers externally, which should have been a huge red flag.
I've been doing the work of multiple people (backline, frontline, fries, drive-thru, maintenance, stocking, prep, and manager duties) under the assumption that my hard work would pay off. In December, we had a mass exodus of staff—four team leaders who were promoted left because the work was too taxing for the pay. It was just me and the manager left, and I was guilt-tripped into staying with the dangling carrot of a promotion.
I feel naive, clueless, and completely used. My friends in similar fast-food jobs get raises every 3-6 months. Meanwhile, my friends outside this industry are starting their careers, making good money, and enjoying their lives. It's hard not to feel like I've wasted the last two years.
The Pressure of College and Future Expenses
This situation has become urgent because I've just been accepted into college to study cybersecurity. My responsibilities and expenses are about to explode, and I have no way to afford them on my current income. I'm looking at:
 * Good Laptop for Cybersecurity: $1,500+
 * Used Car: at least $3,500
 * College Tuition: (My job offers no assistance)
 * Books & Supplies: ~$1,000
 * General Living Expenses/Bills: ~$1,000
Even with aggressive budgeting, my current monthly expenses are around $800, so my savings are minimal. I have no energy to study or work out after a shift, and the strict phone policy makes it hard to even maintain relationships.
The Dilemma: Guilt vs. Self-Preservation
A huge part of me feels incredibly guilty about leaving. The store is so understaffed (it's often just me and a couple of others) that I feel like I'd be abandoning them. I've always struggled with putting my own needs first.
I told myself I would quit if nothing changed by August. Now, a pay raise is supposedly scheduled for next week, which is the first week of August. I don't even know how much it will be. Even if I get a raise to $15 an hour, working 4-hour shifts six days a week just isn't sustainable. It feels wrong to leave right after they've started my certification training and are about to give me a raise, even though I know I'm being manipulated. I feel like I've developed Stockholm syndrome with my coworkers.
Looking for Advice and Next Steps
I know I need to find a better job, but I don't know where to start.
 * How can I find a job that I can balance with a demanding college schedule?
 * I stayed for the ""manager"" title for my resume, but my friends say my fast-food skills won't transfer to other industries. Is that true? Will I be starting from scratch?
 * I'm 5'11"" and skinny, and I can't lift over 150 lbs, so heavy-lifting jobs are out. I've thought about trades like HVAC or something in design, but I'm open to ideas.
I feel lost. People tell me I'm lucky to have a ""stable"" job, but when Walmart pays $16/hour and Home Depot pays $18/hour, this feels anything but stable or lucky. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1mb1ka4/my_current_job_situation/,1753660914.0,throw-away-dev_,1mb1ka4,advice_seeking
findapath,ask for a raise,"28 years old, so many options but I can't decide what to do, stuck","Hello everybody. I'll give a run down of the current situation and then more of the background/ emotional situation. Here we go!

I'm 28, I left medical school 3 years ago, and am now studying psychology instead with 1 year left in my bachelors. I study online from a Canadian university while I live in Italy, where I originally came to study medicine.

I really hate my studying and I am extremely passionate about Buddhism and Jungian analysis (dream analysis and depth psychology) whereas what I study is so surface level and the same medical model I left medical school to get away from. I study the human soul (psyche-ology) and what it means to be alive, I spend my days reading and studying either Buddhist or Jungian texts, meditating, or writing poetry in nature, analyzing my dreams, meditating and going to church, this kind of thing. I spent a week at a Buddhist monastery in November and I think I learned a more in that week of inner work than anything I have ever gotten in school.

Im doing the degree to have a paper on the wall but I have to say, although its not hard work, but it drains my soul. Every-time I have to work on my degree is hours of procrastination and then hours of unwinding to get through a simple assignment. I know It would be a waste to not finish at this point and so many years of studying, but holy shit it kills me inside, and then I do not do my own studying of writing out my dreams, or doing my other readings, or making this post for example, something i've been planning for 1 whole month.

Right now, I have until the end of August to stay in my current apartment (where I live with my Dad, who moved to Italy when my parents separated, basically usurping my life, 4 years ago, long story) in northern Italy. This was not where I chose to live, I'd always wanted to live in either a big city or the south (where half my family is from) but my father, being from the north, demanded I go to a school in the north. Now I'm familiar with my city and made a life here, I'm comfortable (I know the lady who sells my veg and fruit, and she's the best) but inside, its never where I wanted to be. I could stay here (and not pay rent) and get a little job for the summer, or I could move to Sicily and try and find season work that may also give housing, then find an apartment to live there for the winter (when rent is cheap as fuck bc no tourists) and because I speak english and italian (and understandable french and spanish) I dont think i'll have trouble finding work. Then, after I finish the bachelors I can move to spain as I always wanted to finish my masters and then be a practicing psychologist. Or I could do work aways for the summer, and then find an apartment in September in the south.

I would also, like every red blooded millenial, like to make a youtube or instagram page where I share my more depth psychology learnings and such, but I fear of what to say or how to start and all the standard embarrassment. If youre interested I recently posted one of my poems on r/buddhism, it was my last post if you care to see.

But this is the long story short. I'm looking out of the nest ready to jump, my wings out stretched, I just need to be pointed in a direction and given a little push.

edit: I forgot to add, I realized I basically want to be a priest. My idea with medicine, like most, was to ""help people"" but I realized I want to help their souls, not their body's. I'd be a priest if I could have a family, but there is also the complication that I'm more Buddhist than catholic. I believe in Christ as an emanation of the Buddha of compassion, so I cannot truly be a priest, even in a protestant denomination where you could have a family, I would not be a full believer and It would not be good for the community. Furthermore, I cannot be a Zen monk, because I'd also like to have a bit of a normal life, I'm not at the age where I can just say no to the world and live on a monastery. [This guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kennedy_(Jesuit)) is an inspiration of mine, he is a Jesuit, a Zen Roshi, and a Jungian analyst. But he doesn't have a family :(

anti TL:DR  
For some back story. I was raised in Canada and always wanted to be a doctor since I was in and out of the sickkids hospital when i was younger (everything is ok now). Fast forward to after highschool, and my parents select where and what I can study, thought I'd like to do something else. After 3 years of undergrad in Canada, I got into medical school in Italy, so said fuck it and went there, but my father chose where I got to live. I wanted to go to Rome, both a big city and in the south, but no, I had to go in the f\*cking pianura padana di merda p\*rco d\*\*. Only in 3rd year do you start clinicals here in italy, and when I did I had a big ""Oh shit, this isnt what I want to do"" moment, along with others. I was really into psychedelics, and when making a presentation about them in pharmacology class, my professor (who admitted at the begining of class for ""conflicts of interest"" that he was an employee of PFIZER) started laughing at the idea a depressed person does not need a subscription to medications. This was right when Corona was going on, so all this plus that new stress, I said fuck this and left.

I fucked around doing nothing but recover from medical school for a year, then moved to holland to study psychology. Long story short Holland was cold and the food and people sucked (they dont suck, just very closed), so I moved back to Canada for a few months, staying with my parents, which was horrible, then last year back to Italy to study online, living with my Dad. I didn't want to live in a cold-anglosaxon country anymore (no offence if that's where you live, its just not for me), in Holland I got levels of seasonal depression that I didn't know were possible.

The issue is I am studying psychology basically for 2 reasons. 1. I get student grants, due to a disability I have my tuition is free and I get about 500 euroes a month living expenses. Im basically paid to study, I have to say, not a bad deal. and 2, because my father basically pushed me into it. My grievance is I never got to choose what I want to do, I was always pressured into the next thing, and I hate my degree. Its the same degree my father did, psychology by correspondance. I feel I could learn and share so much more with Buddha and Jung but im here doing fucking stats and writing a 200 word ""essay"" on what is the definition of emotion (instead of feeling and exploring emotions, we define them!), and people need me to be qualified to trust me as a psychologist.

The last couple years I've just been at home, basically high all day, sometimes also drunk, depressed out of my SHIT basically sad to wake up everyday. I used to be so excited and happy about life When I think about, for example, studying the 37 practices of the Bodhisattva, i get excited, but i hear in my head my father ""isnt that just a secondary thing to your degree?"", and i get discouraged and then depressed. Then I procrastinate my degree work and smoke and drink all day, then i feel bad about myself, and this negative loop goes on. At some points I'd even stop eating and lost quite a bit of weight I've started to just DO my school work, but it feels like I am selling my soul each time I do, and it drains me. I'm also not smoking or drinking as much knowing its not good for me and not a solution. I'm also exercising again. But I know I cannot willpower my way out of this as I tried in the past. I need to replace this shittyness with something good, I just dont know what that good is yet.

If you have any questions please feel free to ask!!!

findapath,ask for a raise,21 year old needing finance career advice. Where do I fit in finance or beyond?,"Hi everyone,

I’m looking for clear, actionable advice on where I fit in finance (or beyond). I want to align high compensation, a good lifestyle, and my interests in macro-politics, but I’m unsure which path to take.

I graduated with a BSc in Business Management (Finance) from ESCP with a 3.4 GPA. Currently, I’m interning for six months at a boutique capital raising firm in South Africa, which is my first proper finance role. Before that, I did a three-month internship as a business development analyst at a boutique family office that managed €200M in assets. At my current internship, I support handling client sourcing, build relationships with industry leaders across Africa and Europe, assist with financial modeling, PowerPoint presentations, and general deal support. My boss has 20 years of experience in investment banking at Barclays, so I’m hoping to get a future referral.

I am an ENTJ, sociable, and a fast learner. I’m good at math (not at a quant level). I’ve always been told I’m charismatic and good at negotiation and feel like I would be good at relationship building. I have a passion for theology, history and politics, and my long-term dream is to invest in infrastructure back home to help people, possibly through a fund or other means. I almost pursued a degree in political science, and I was initially interested in clandestine operations, but the compensation and my identity exposure isn't great.

In terms of what I want from a career, I’m aiming for high earning potential early on—higher than most of my peers—while also having time to focus on my health, fitness, and spending weekends with my girlfriend, as I’ll likely be marrying at 25 due to cultural reasons, etc. I want a role that utilizes my sociability and negotiation skills, one that’s not just behind a computer screen all day. I want to eventually be someone others depend on and trust. I also want to develop expertise in macroeconomics and politics, so I can spot financial opportunities and understand global events, even after my career.

What I’m unsure about is whether I should continue in finance (asset management, hedge funds, investment banking, etc.) or pivot into consulting, political risk, or another field. I understand that high pay often comes with long hours, but I don’t want to sacrifice my 20s for a job I might not even enjoy. I’m also unsure which firms I should target since I don’t feel competitive enough for the “top” places yet. Another part of me is attracted to a career that resembles the “spy” lifestyle, where there’s international travel, a focus on geopolitics and strategy, and negotiation-heavy that pay well. I’ve been thinking a lot about this because I no longer feel that investment banking is the right fit for me due to how crazy the hours are and I feel like I would regret it and lose my fitness, health and relationships.

What I’m looking for are specific career paths, firms, or industries that balance high compensation, a good lifestyle, and my interests in macroeconomics, geopolitics, and strategy. I’m considering pursuing a CFA or a master’s degree after my internship ends in a few months, but I’d love some guidance on what steps to take next. i'm not naive and understand high pay usually means higher hours but I'm wondering if theres a sweet spot that suits my personality.

Ideally, by 24 or 26, I want to be living in a high-rise with glass windows and a city view, having a clear path. I’m genuinely trying to figure out what I can do to get there, but I don’t know exactly what path I should be pursuing. I'm just lost.

I don’t have many people to ask, since most of my peers come from wealthier backgrounds and are less concerned about figuring out their career paths. My family is supportive but more relaxed about what I choose to do. Sorry if I sound naive, but I’m truly seeking guidance on where I should go from here. What specific career paths and firms should I focus on given my goals?

findapath,ask for a raise,I'm tired of graphic design.,"Hey sub! I honestly don’t know what to do with my professional life anymore. I’m 40 and I’m just tired of working as a graphic designer. I’m sick of the huge egos a lot of designers have just because they’ve worked with a bunch of big brands. I’m fed up with this exploitative industry that sees us as disposable tools, and with all those ridiculous job listings asking for a hundred different skills while offering pretty average pay.

I’m also done dealing with clients who think they’re designers and don’t value our work.  
I’m a very introverted person, and I’ve never liked the work culture in Latinamerican design agencies. So I ended up getting a remote job with a design-as-a-service company based in the U.S. — but honestly, they don’t care about their employees either. Sometimes they treat us like we’re worthless, and they haven’t given us a raise in three years.

I’ve never seen myself as a super creative person, but I try to give clients what they need and that’s it. On top of that, I don’t like networking, so I haven’t kept in touch with anyone I’ve worked with before — and now I’m struggling to find a new job because of that.

I tried getting into UX, like some people suggested, mostly through online courses, but I really didn’t enjoy the research part — having to interview people and interact with users just wasn’t for me. I didn’t feel any real connection to that field.

Right now, I just don’t know what to do to turn things around in my career. I was good at math, chemistry, and physics in school, and I get the basics of programming logic. So I’ve been thinking about maybe switching to development or studying data analysis. I don’t want to freelance, my portfolio sucks and I don't want to update it, I’m burned out on graphic design, and I just don’t want to go back to it.",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1lirnw2/im_tired_of_graphic_design/,1750710920.0,Lyomak,1lirnw2,advice_seeking
findapath,ask for a raise,I am currently lost in my professional life after I resigned from the last job,"Before I start to tell you my story, I would like to apologise in advance if my English comes off as rude. It is my third language and I haven't been exposed to English speaking cultures for that reason I might lack situational and cultural awareness. 

With that being said, here is my situation: 

It has been a few months since I resigned from my last corporate job. I have worked at an international company for 4 years in managerial track. I started as an interpreter (English was not a language I interpreted from/into), then I moved to a Technical Specialist position, a year later I was promoted to Senior Technical Specialist. In the end of 2023 I was left alone in the managerial track, so on top of the responsibilities I already had, I became responsible for managing 8 people in a technical track as well(without an official promotion of becoming a manager). 

The previous workplace was a bit chaotic, hectic (flexible at times), and lacked leadership guidance. Basically, it means that any responsibility could be assigned to you by your upper-management  (I was in middle management) regardless of your level of experience (we had a ""push your limits"" culture), sometimes without clear instructions. We, as employees, were joking about how dangerous it is to walk in a hallway of Open Space Office as you could be given an additional responsibility at any moment. 

Jokes aside, this approach of upper management had cons and pros. 

Cons are that you might lack operational knowledge to perform a task and no one is there to actually guide you so you have to figure things out on your own. It can be stressful at times and you are totally blameable for an outcome so you have to do your best. People who worked in upper-management came from a country where you can't use excuses to explain why you failed. Even if they completely justify your failure. You can't do it. You have to take ownership for bad results/good results no matter what.

Pros are that it gives you opportunities to learn things beyond your delineated responsibilities which contributes to your professional growth. You learn how to take initiative and learn how to manage stress in an unknown situations. You become versatile in your knowledge and diligent in your work. You get rid of the mindset ""shifting blame on circumstances/ people etc"". 

I was responsible for a few things: 

1.  I managed the section's budget I worked in. I allocated it according to operational needs, I forecasted budget for the next year based on the last year performance, backing it up with proves. (The company was obsessed with justifying every step you take), I found ways to save many so that we could use it if an emergency arose. (In last two years, the budget was cut down significantly)

2. My section was part of a production department. Among the sections that were part of it, our sections was the one responsible for having spare parts stock for production lines **so I managed a warehouse** as well. I had to make sure that we had right amount of spare parts at right time(You can't just buy as many spare parts as possible. It is considered as an inefficient budget spending. You have to forecast quantity needed to run the lines so that the production department can meet a production rate). I was responsible for an annual inventory initiated by a financial department every year. (They had to submit results to Tax Administration). If there was mismatch I was held accountable. The amount of money I was responsible for was millions so I had to make sure there was no mismatch between real stock and SAP stock. 

3.  I had a few projects that I led end-to-end, where I wrote technical descriptions, gathered quotations, sent them to purchase department so that they could do bidding, worked with a legal team to ensure that a project would go smoothly; I monitored the progress of the work and made sure that projects met the objectives. 

4. I solved problems and found solutions - whether it was organising collaborative work between people who did not live in the same country, did not speak even English and had time zone difference, who had to do their job remotely while I guided them and interpreted who did what in what order or finding a way to repair equipments without spending thousands of dollars or stopping lines, or identifying errors in a production system by using SQL knowledge. 

5. Negotiating prices and contracts were also among my responsibilities. this is why I worked closely with a financial department, a purchase department and a legal department. 

6.  When I was left with 8 people in a team, I became responsible for their performance. I did everything that a good manager should do: I trusted their expertise, I found solutions to problems if they were stuck, I defended them in front of upper-management, I made sure that they were engaged and were motivated to work for the company(I had to create values that they would hold onto). I applied ""service"" leadership even though upper-management practiced authoritative leadership. (They were born and raised in a hierarchal society so it was understandable why they could not be service leaders) 

7. Outsource was also my responsibility.

  
Since I spoke two language, sometimes I played a bridge role between two opposite cultures (Upper-management was consists of people who came from another country and their subordinates were people from my country) where I reduced frictions/tension by explaining each party's motivation and cultural nuances. (Because I could understand the both sides) - this experience taught how to walk on a tightrope and be sensitive to shifts in atmosphere, be objective in conflicts, understand where misunderstandings came from etc. 

Despite being praised verbally for the hard work I put in, unfortunately, I did not receive any extra pay for additional responsibilities I was assigned to. To be fair, I was even okay with it, because I thought I could trade money for career opportunities. To my disappointment, I was offered to lead another section only when I submitted a resignation letter (I could not lead officially the section I was in because I did not have a specific education that was required by a governmental law). 

The reason why I did not take the offer was because I, as person, who worked in a managerial track and managed people, I believed that one of my responsibilities was to recognise my team members contribution before they even articulated it. The same thing I was expecting from upper-management when it came to me. **This is a manager's job.** You might think that was a ridiculous reason to reject the offer. In my defence, I am a human too. I was an employee of the company too. I felt very unappreciated and taken for granted many times. So it added to my decision to leave the company.  

Additionally, I was exhausted from working in the manufacturing industry. I had an incessant feeling that I did not belong here (Maybe I convinced myself to think that way because the job I did was lacking creativity, it was an extremely technical job for that reason it suffocated my at times). In spite of feeling that way, I never let it affect my job. I know what ""being professional"" means. I sucked it up and did my best. 

So, given the experience I had, I realized that I am passionate about managing people, solving problems, organising things, improving workflow because this is what I did and excelled in my previous jobs. I am an ambitious person who does not shy away from hard work, but I have to be appreciated for my efforts (I am a Y and Z person according to management theory). 

**However, I do not know in which industry I should search job for.** 

Whenever I ask myself where I want to work, I go blank. And I don't know why. I know who I want to work as, but I don't know where I want to work and this is the problem I am facing now. 

I browse LinkedIn periodically to see if I find something suitable for me. I don't have high expectations for a job. I agree to go on a probationary period because I understand that an employer might be unsure about whether I am a good fit or not, or whether I am equipped enough to contribute to a company's growth and success.  I might agree on relatively lower salary if there are potential career opportunities for me. 

I have sent my resume to a few companies and got rejected. I am not demoralised by it because I, myself, do not know if I was suitable for the roles they posted. (I did my best to tailor my resume to their expectations though)

 My previous jobs, beside the last one that I mentioned above, were:

\- Guests facing job. I live in a historic city with a lot of museums. I used to work as a tour guide(spent 3 years in this industry. It was pre-covid era),I taught the history of my city and taught the art history to my foreign guests (Rembrandt, Rubens, Da Vinci, Caravaggio etc) . This job taught be how to be on schedule and manage stressful and unexpected situations without going into a panic mode. 

\- Construction industry. I worked as an interpreter. Basically, I ensured smooth communication between foreign stakeholders and subcontractors. Anticipated and resolved conflicts that stemmed from cultural and professional differences. 

In between, helped to organise two governmental events, one concert of a foreign celebrity and many random interpretation jobs. 

After I resigned from the last job, I stopped using the language that was a part of my life for about a decade. I don't want to work with the nation that speaks this language anymore (nothing racist here. I just released that they can't offer me anything, plus, we have completely different work ethics) 

I have a couple of months before my savings dry up. I blame my versatile experience for making me indecisive about my next career.  I might be wrong but I think it is easier to see your path if you have been dedicated your career to one thing for a long time. 

For me, it is hard to understand in which direction I should  go. I will appreciate any advice you are willing to give me. 

Thank you in advance.",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1l34bzt/i_am_currently_lost_in_my_professional_life_after/,1749040282.0,Mhoryga_Fenrieth,1l34bzt,advice_seeking
findapath,negotiate salary,26m. Still stuck at home and have nothing to offer,"I don't know why, but somewhere along the line I started getting angry and bitter about everything. I watched as my childhood friends started getting jobs, getting married, buying houses, and building their own lives. Most of them are younger than I am, a couple by 5 years even. All the while I'm still stuck living with my parents and never having made over $15/hr.

I'm a self taught programmer. Programming used to be a passion that I spent 13 years learning until I got my first interview (which took 3 years of putting in applications to get). I put every ounce of effort into getting and doing the interview, which I practically had to beg for. They said they were impressed, but would be going with someone else. It destroyed all of my willpower and motivation.

Now I work as a logistics dispatcher and make just enough to survive. I'm supposed to be negotiating a salary but I don't see a point. The company that I work for is notoriously cheap. And I don't enjoy things like I used to anymore. Video games, drawing etc. I don't have any friends and I don't know how to get out of the house and meet people my own age.

I've really started distancing myself from people too. I find that I'm less willing to be around even the people closest to me with each passing day.

I can fake a smile all day long and jab back socially, but inside I've lost the sense that I have anything good to offer anybody and that I have anything to look forward to.

findapath,negotiate salary,"Torn between career options. Teachers, Engineers, Career Changers, Could you please share your advice?","Hi all,

I’m at a crossroads and could really use advice from anyone who’s worked in education, engineering, or made a value based career shift, especially if you’re an INFJ, HSP, or someone who prioritizes meaningful work and life balance.

I currently work as a full time engineer with a decent salary (~$105K base) and good benefits. Recently, I’ve been offered a role at a private school that aligns more with what I find fulfilling: mentoring, coaching, and contributing to student growth, especially in STEM and robotics.

Here are the three options I’m weighing in:

1. Stay in engineering and coach robotics part time (+$7.5K)

Keep full salary and benefits

Possible burnout juggling both roles

Limited time for family and side consulting work

Long-term misalignment with what feels meaningful

Might be getting laid off anyways as current job is not getting enough business this year.


2. Switch to a dual role at a private school: full-time upper school substitute teacher + robotics coach (~$46K combined, will be negotiating more)

Mission driven work, mentoring students, school calendar with summers off

Possibly more time for family and personal projects

Significant pay cut and will lose unvested money (about $20K) from current job

Uncertain adjustment to classroom dynamics as a full-time sub, especially without U.S. K–12 teaching experience


3. Just the robotics coach role (~$7.5K stipend, will negotiate more)

Highly aligned with passion and skills

Part time hours (4-5 hours / week)= more consulting work and family time

No benefits, minimal pay unless supplemented

Riskier financially but potentially more sustainable emotionally. Have invested money to last one year of expenses.


My priorities:

Work life balance and time with my young child

Meaningful mentorship, especially through STEM

Flexibility to grow a mission aligned consulting practice

Avoiding burnout and soul numbing work

More time to focus on self improvement


I’d love to hear from:

People who’ve moved from corporate to education

Substitutes or coaches at private schools, what’s the real day-to-day like?

Anyone who’s tried to straddle two worlds (technical + teaching)


Would appreciate any honest takes, personal experiences, or ""if I were you"" insights. Thank you!

findapath,negotiate salary,Changing careers at 30 - UK,"After working in the film & TV industry in London for about six years now (two as an office assistant at a production company; four as a personal assistant at an agency) I think the time has come for me to do something else. 

The only reason I've been in the industry and in my specific role for so long is because I was pursuing my screenwriting ambitions, and it was a good way to learn about how things work and make contacts. In fact, I already made a post very similar to this one on some subreddits a couple of years ago, when I was last feeling hopeless about my prospects. After that, things did look brighter for me for quite some time, as I started sharing my work around and having lots of positive feedback and meetings - but nothing (and, most importantly, nothing financial) has come from them. Perhaps it's the state of the industry at the moment; perhaps I'm not talented enough; or perhaps it's just bad luck. Regardless, I can't keep doing what I've been doing; I need a change and to reassess what alternative career paths might be open to me.

Bit of info on me. Achieved A*A*AA at A2-Level in Sixth Form; received a First in Film & Literature from a Russell Group uni for my BA; then a Distinction in Filmmaking for my MA.

My current work is primarily administrative and organisational, scheduling meetings and managing the diaries of the two agents I assist and the hundred-or-so clients they represent. Over the past couple of years I've become more directly involved with negotiating deals and contracts for clients, too. Other duties involve issuing paperwork and ensuring any necessary documentation is completed; managing internal databases; pitching clients for projects; booking accommodation and travel; updating the website and promoting clients' work on social media; providing feedback on clients' work and assessing the work of new potential clients. 

Ideally I'd like a job that matches my current salary sans bonus, which is £32k - although in switching careers to a role I have less experience in, I appreciate it might well be less (£28k being the absolute floor for me). I want a job that offers hybrid working, a good work/life balance, and has opportunities for progression. I'd also like something that provides me with some sense of fulfilment, that makes me feel like I am doing some good in the world.

I don't a job that is overly corporate, or where I have to sell anything. I'm very bad at feigning enthusiasm lol.

I don't suppose anyone here might be able to offer me any advice? What kind of roles might I be well-suited for? Obviously I'd be happy to find something that is just largely administrative, so long as it affords me the opportunity to learn and develop and progress into a role that is more skilled (and better paid). What industries or areas should I look into, and how might I go about this? 

These past couple of weeks I've started applying for new jobs - mostly alternative roles in film & TV, most of which should provide me the opportunity to gain more experience and learn new skills applicable to roles both in the industry and outside of it. I also applied for a Programme Coordinator role at a non-profit, as the responsibilities largely overlap with that of my current job (I'd really love to get that position, I think). The next task on my list of things to do is to share my CV with a number of recruiters, the details of whom I already have bookmarked. But what should I be doing after that, beyond repeatedly going through the job sites I also have bookmarked, looking for potential suitable roles?

Has anyone had any luck with career counsellors, too? I had a little google a while back, but am obviously concerned about getting scammed by people who don't know what they're talking about. That research led me to putting out a Bark to a bunch of counsellors, but only one person responded to me - whose profile emphasised her experience helping teachers rediscover their love of teacher and/or finding an alternative career path. Which didn't really feel appropriate or super-relevant to my particular situation. 

Apologies, there are lots of different questions here and this post is all a bit ramble-y!",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1lhjmdi/changing_careers_at_30_uk/,1750583375.0,SuaveSerf,1lhjmdi,advice_seeking
findapath,negotiate salary,Case study - honest long post,"Case study — honest, long post (not encouraging you to read it):

I don’t have any official work experience. For the past 9 years, I’ve been supporting myself. I make money because I’m smart, disciplined, and know how to get things done. But this way of living has started to wear me down. I want to finally stabilize and change. I’m not looking for a job because of financial pressure.

The reason is different — I don’t want to waste my time or fall into drugs just to make life feel easier. I want fulfillment. I’ll admit I’ve had some history with drugs. My attitude toward them is neutral — I understand why people use them (they feel good), but I also understand how they degrade you, how they’re addictive, etc. I’ve been clean for 3 months now.

I have experience in many areas: trade, sales, customer service, marketing, logistics, representation, negotiations, finance, and law. I can quickly identify risks. I’ve worked in so many industries I can’t even name them all off the top of my head. I’ve usually left with a solid reputation. I’ve always had a strong work ethic — I’m a perfectionist. I wake up early, I work in the mornings, and I handle tasks then. I solve problems as they come (and there are many). I’m available 24/7.

For a few years, I managed a team. I trained people from scratch. I had 5 people working under me regularly, all satisfied. I was a good boss — I can assess people and figure out what they really want. I thrive under pressure — it’s my natural environment.

I’ve studied a lot, and I’m still studying now (this current field I actually value), but I haven’t finished a single degree. I see most university programs as overrated — except for the one I’m doing now. I got bored of listening to lecturers with outdated worldviews repeating things I already figured out. Still, I’ve taken lessons from past fields and applied them effectively at work.

I believe that any disciplined person with access to the internet and ChatGPT can reach their goals, make money, do something. If something’s not working — fix it. That’s how I see life: I try, I fail, I learn from it, I improve, I move forward.

Now here’s the question: Where can I find a job? How do I adapt to society? Is the only option building my own business from scratch or finding a partner who won’t try to screw me over? How to explain to someone what I do? 

Put yourself in my shoes. I don’t want to waste my time on a full-time job where I could be replaced by anyone. Should I go work at a convenience store? As a courier? Warehouse? Reception?

I don’t look down on anyone doing those jobs — life takes us all different places, and I respect that. But my time has a different value. On a good week, I make that kind of monthly salary in one day. I have a wide global network of contacts. I stay up to date with technology, markets, geopolitics, and law.

I want to work somewhere where my skills are truly appreciated. Where I can meet passionate people and be part of something meaningful. A project. A mission. Something that makes sense.

Additional info:
I don’t have a bank account, no loans, no kids, no obligations. I own free capital (~1M). I live alone, “off the radar,” on my own terms. I’m genuinely grateful for the life I have — I don’t take it for granted.

And yes — most of my work has been illegal and off the books. It stemmed from a youthful hatred of the system, which later turned into a comfortable lifestyle. But I’ve never hurt anyone who didin’t had it comming.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1jqxtrp/case_study_honest_long_post/,1743723528.0,alb1nosek,1jqxtrp,advice_seeking
findapath,negotiate salary,"27M, R&D/Design Engineer, Polyglot (5 Languages), Earning Less Than €240/month – Am I Undervalued or Missing Something","Hey Reddit,

I’m a 27-year-old R&D and Design Engineer with 1 year of professional experience in Turkey and Tunisia. I’m also a polyglot—I speak English, French, Arabic, and Turkish fluently, and I’m at a B1 level in German. Despite my qualifications and language skills, I’m currently earning less than €240/month, which feels shockingly low for my profile. I’m starting to wonder if I’m being undervalued or if there’s something I’m missing in my career strategy.

Here’s a bit more about my background:
- I have a degree in engineering and 1 year of hands-on experience in R&D and design engineering roles.
- I’ve worked on projects in both Turkey and Tunisia, gaining exposure to different markets and engineering challenges.
- My language skills (English, French, Arabic, Turkish, and basic German) make me a strong candidate for international roles or companies with global operations.

Despite these strengths, my current salary is barely enough to cover basic living expenses. I’ve tried negotiating with my employer, but the response has been discouraging. I’m starting to feel stuck and unsure of how to move forward.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How did you navigate it? Are there specific industries, countries, or roles where my skills could be better compensated? Should I be looking for remote work, relocating, or targeting multinational companies?

findapath,negotiate salary,"21M pursuing a BS in Psychology, wondering where to go next","I (21M) have three semesters left before receiving my Bachelor of Science in Psychology. For the past semester I've been married to the idea of becoming a clinical mental health counselor. I thought, ""I get to help people overcome past trauma, anxiety, and depression, sounds great!"" Then the downsides hit me:

• high turnover rate
• 45-50k starting salary after two years of grad school

As much as I'd love to be a counselor, what I care more about is providing for my future family. Buying a home in a decent neighborhood, having my family live comfortably, and raising my kids in a good school system are non-negotiables for me. I'm just not sure that the counseling route is best with those goals in mind.

One idea that's been thrown across my desk is pursuing an MBA degree. I've read that Psychology majors can get accepted into those degree programs thanks to their well understanding of people, which makes me optimistic. I just want to get a specific plan in place. Assuming a high-level position in a company sounds more appealing to me than owning a business.

What are y'all's thoughts on me pursuing an MBA? Do y'all have any other ideas for what my next life move after attaining my BS in Psych could be?

findapath,promotion advice,Need some advice regarding a promotion.,"So let me just start off by saying I struggle with anxiety. This will come into play later haha.

My job is a very odd one. Its more of a career with a pension at the end and I started it right out of college. Which is also important because I feel ""trapped"" since I have no experience elsewhere. The first position hired on my job is 90% basic manual labor. I have the certification to drive trucks and some heavy machinery but other than that I don't see a window for me changing careers. To add I've also been on my job for 7 years so that's 7 years towards a pension.

One other things of importance to note, my job runs on seniority a ton and our schedule is made DAY TO DAY. Which is to say I have had weeks where I have worked 4pm to midnight. Come back in scheduled the next day 8am to 4pm. And then was scheduled the next day for that night at midnight. It is NOT FUN, but when you have no seniority its how it is on my job. Its brutal but with 7 years on I no longer really have that issue. And here's where all the ""promotional"" problems begin and where I need some real advice.....

The promotion is not like other jobs. Its not ""doing a similar job just with more responsibility"". It goes from manual labor to 10000000 real quick. Now you are in charge. You also have to write tickets which is what really bothers me. I should add I was promoted once and gave it back due to anxiety over ticket writing. Seriously you are sent all over where I live and will work some days in really bad neighborhoods at all hours of the day. To add the workers you are in charge of have a strong union and can straight up give you a hard time with almost no repurcussions. Its stressful, anxiety filled, and remember when I mentioned seniority and crazy schedules? Yeah when you're promoted you start right back at 0. So after eating shit for 4-5 years and now having 7 years I will go right back to essentially ""starting over"".

Now I mentioned I gave the promotion back once so why the post? Well I am up for the promotion again and with the world the way it is we can always use a better salary. But everytime I picture myself in that position again I can already feel the stress, the anxiety, the inability to make the quick decisions required, and my lack of being able to deal with the workers and their attitudes and such.

I dont see a way to quit my ""career"" but I also want to continue personal and financial growth but this promotion made me absolutely miserable last time I tried it.

findapath,promotion advice,"29M, Useless Degree, Dead end job","Needed advice on what to do in terms of what kind of career path to take at my current point in life. Graduated in 2022 with a Bachelors of Science in Digital Media, had a passion for it which fizzled out senior year and just decided to finish the degree since I was already behind my original schedule. Fast forward to now, I have been stuck at the same retail job that I was doing while in college as a ""Senior Merchandiser"" which is really just a inventory control/invoicing job as I sit in the back and check in Purchase orders and customer orders making about $20 an hour (commission which is really just an extra hundred bucks each check.) 

I have really been trying to move up in the company I work at now because it deals with a hobby of mine which is motorcycles, but internal job postings have been getting less and less and the jobs usually require years of previous experience that I don't have. (accounting, UX design, Web development etc.) Also the companies practices are pretty scummy when it comes to the front line retail employees with bad pay, no raises, and pretty terrible retail management practices.

I have been trying to get jobs that relate to what I do such as inventory control, logistics  control, purchasing for the past 3 years and I have just been getting absolutely nothing. My girlfriend keeps pushing for me to be as SDR but I have done sales and just do not like it at all. I don't want to apply for a sales job and then be stuck having to try and make it work. 

Here's a shortened version of my resume so you can get an idea of my previous experience, if that helps.

Senior Merchandiser	May 2022 - Present

* Oversee all aspects of inventory management, including inventory control, replenishment, and cycle counting, to ensure accuracy and minimize stockouts and excess inventory
* Conduct regular inventory audits and cycle counts to identify discrepancies and implement corrective actions

* Conducted market research and analysis to identify emerging trends and consumer preferences, resulting in improved product offerings
* Mentored and coached junior merchandising team members to enhance their skills and performance

Sales Team Lead           Aug. 2020 - Apr. 2022

* Achieved 130% of annual sales quota and was recognized as the top salesperson in district
* Consistently exceeded monthly sales goals by an average of 17% by providing exceptional customer service and product expertise 
* Educated customers on store promotions and loyalty programs, exceeding sales targets, and achieving a 94% customer satisfaction rating
* Stayed up-to-date with brand and product knowledge, company information, sales and company-wide events to provide customers with the best possible service 

Social Media Manager	Aug. 2019 - Mar. 2020

* Published and edited photos and videos of customer experiences for website and social media accounts
* Managed a team of photographers and videographers, overseeing scheduling, and community engagement
* Captured photos and videos of customer events for website and social media accounts 



Just wanting to see if anyone has any career advice at my age with my experience. I have been looking at trade schools but the initial low pay worries me, I have thought about military since at least that gives me some kind of skills and benefits, or even FAA jobs like ATC.

findapath,promotion advice,27M Finally found happiness after pivoting to tech. Laid off a few months ago. Now what?,"Hi everyone!

  
This will be a rather lengthy post, as it will serve as much a place for ranting as it will for seeking advice. I'll provide a TLDR at the end if you'd like to skip the wall of text. 

  
My parents are both currently unemployed, and we have struggled with money our whole lives. I went to bottom-of-the-barrel public schools where a significant portion of the student population was on free and reduced lunch, graduation rates were the lowest in the district, and the average ACT score of my graduating class was 3 points below the national average. It was an easy environment to stand out in as I coasted through it, and I was frequently encouraged to pursue all the ""big ticket"" goals you might expect (get a PhD, go to med school, etc). I began working as a dishwasher during this time. 

  
I ended up going to a state school despite high test scores due, in part, to a lack of extracurriculars (and admittedly, in hindsight, probably subpar essays). Taking the aforementioned advice to heart, I decided to major in Microbiology as a track to med school. Pretty early on, I realized school just wasn't for me (from an enjoyment perspective), so I resolved to graduate as soon as possible while working 20-40 hours a week at a veterinary diagnostic lab in between classes. I naively believed I would be fine once I got a degree, not understanding that biology degrees are essentially worthless. This period of my life was pretty miserable for me, and I feel a bit cheated out of the ""college experience"" so many of my peers look back on fondly. 

  
I managed to graduate in 3 years with a 3.6 GPA with honors, and immediately noted my mistake in major. Steeling myself for another year of school, I enrolled in a Medical Laboratory Science program for its clear path to steady, stable employment. I cruised through the program and passed the board exam with little to no studying while working a part-time barista job. I was lucky to find a day-shift position in a metropolitan city's blood bank.

  
The work, hours, pay, treatment, and opportunities for advancement left a lot to be desired. It was busy as hell, working weekends and holidays was killing my personal life, I was constantly verbally abused by surgeons and nurses alike, the pay (I was hired on at a pay scale reflective of 3+ YOE due to my previous lab experience) was well below what my peers in tech and business roles were making, and the opportunities for advancement were nonexistent (lead techs would receive a $0.50 raise upon promotion). After \~1.5 years, I had saved up enough money to quit and began teaching myself how to code for a pivot into tech while working a part-time job in a Best Buy warehouse.

  
I ended up going to a bootcamp (total waste of money as I had already learned everything in the program and more in my independent study, but it did give me the confidence required to begin searching for a job), and landed a job doing backend development in Node for a start-up. 

  
I was able to work here for 2 years, and it was the first time I finally felt happy in life. The pay (low six figures) allowed me to do things I only ever dreamed of. I visited outside of North America for the first time, I got SCUBA-certified, and I finally let myself go out to eat. The hours were flexible, I worked from home, my co-workers were amazing, and the work was engaging; I felt like I had finally figured things out. Fast forward to a few months ago, and my entire team was let go with no severance due to an internal decision to offshore development efforts.

  
I've been applying to developer roles since then and can't even get a screening call. I have exhausted my network, and getting a referral seems to be the only way people are able to get their foot in the door now. I don't have the background, skills, or connections to compete with the talent currently looking for positions. I have begun accepting the fact that I will probably not be able to land another role in tech and need to pivot my career yet again. I just don't know what to do now.

  
I am enjoyable to work with and have made lasting friendships everywhere I've worked, have never no-called-no-showed or shown up late, have a great work ethic, have never been put on a PIP, and I learn quickly. I have a wide variety of experience and skills, and I even organically grew a comedy Twitter account to 50k followers during the pandemic. It's frustrating that I have worked so hard to be a good employee and just can't find success. I'm at a loss for what to do next.

  
I'm entertaining the idea of going to law school or dental school despite how miserable it would be, because at least there would be a light at the end of the tunnel with a high-paying job. I don't feel it is worth it at this stage of life to take on a lot more debt for school unless it pays out high-ticket salaries that make it worth it. I'm already far behind in savings and investments for my age, and I would love to at least own a house by the time I'm 40 and maybe even retire one day (lofty goals, I know /s). 

  
I recently saw that LSAT registrations are way up, and the last thing I want to do is compete with a bunch of people with 4.0 GPAs just to get into a field that's gonna be saturated in a few years. This kinda leaves me with just dental school, and I so desperately want to be talked out of it. 

  
Wtf do I do?

findapath,promotion advice,Lost a lot of hope but want to believe I still have time,"I had a very unpleasant conversation with a man on a dating app last night. He was (apparently) a successful anesthesiologist about ten years older than me (I am 27) He asked me about work (I am a sales development rep at a tech sales company) and I mentioned I really hated my job. From there he started grilling me about my major, my career aspirations, everything. His advice ranged from reasonable (I should go into debt for law school) to nonsensical (I should move to Hollywood to become a screenwriter). He was extremely rude and condescending, and the conversation ended with him expressing his disgust with my lack of ambition and how he could never be with someone who kept making excuses and couldn’t “unstick” themselves from a miserable job. He was obviously a jerk, but I’m worried he might have had a valid point or two mixed in with all that BS.

A little about me:

-I graduated from college in 2020 with a degree in English and a minor in pre-law (yes I know it was a horrible mistake in my defense I thought it was a smart choice because English was my best subject in high school and I had been told you could go into a variety of fields with an English degree). I have gotten a few short stories published in different magazine but have never had an “English major job.” I’m not mad about this. I’m more than happy to do any kind of semi-stable corporate job and write on the side.

-I worked at a grocery story full-time for three years before doing a paid-to-learn tech sales program (took me four months). I had no interest in sales, but I couldn’t afford more schooling. I did very well at the program and got my current job right afterwards.

-I have been at my current sales job for a year and a half. I am miserable. Good enough to have not gotten fired yet, but bad enough to know I’ll never be promoted. I have tried to get other jobs but haven’t had a single successful round of interviews since 2023. I’m not good at interviews and don’t know what I’m doing wrong.

-i have thought about everything from beauty school to nursing school to data analytics courses to becoming a therapist to becoming a lawyer to underwater welding (lol) but I am BROKE. Obviously there are loans, but if I can’t tough it out with sales, what reason do I have to believe I’d survive something like law school.

I don’t know what to do. I am lost and don’t know who to turn to for advice. I have so much shame over my life choices and I want to fix them but have no idea where I would start. I am grateful for what my job has given me (I don’t make great money but I make enough to afford rent on a small apartment that I love with all my heart) but I feel like I probably won’t last much longer before I end up on a PIP. This is the most “stable” my life has ever been and I’m still holding on by my fingernails.

findapath,promotion advice,"Almost 30F, no career to speak of and starting to panic","I've been stuck in dead end jobs for the entirety of my 20s. Working as an admin assistant, a manager in hospitality, and now as an office manager. Because I don't have a degree I tend to only get interest from tiny mom and pop companies so getting promoted out of my role or even moving laterally is not an option.

I know I know, the typical advice is to work to live and find something outside your job to give your life meaning. But I just can't get past the idea that I will toil away most of my life for something that means nothing to me. Even if I stretch out my work and find little projects to do, at my current job I have 3-4 hours max and then I just twiddle my thumbs for the rest of the day. Sounds like a dream to some I'm sure, but you don't feel very good about yourself when you're chained to a desk just to piss away half the day on reddit. I once drove in during a blizzard because I'm not allowed to work from home, just to answer 3 e-mails and take one Zoom meeting.

I want to go back to school but everything seems so bleak, it seems there are no options that will lead to a better future. Every career I research seems to say opportunities are stagnating, low wages, poor working conditions. 

I don't know what to do. I feel like time is running out to set myself up for a good life.

findapath,promotion advice,Ran away from so many careers and now trapped at age 45,"At 45, don't know what to do with this life.

I started out in engineering because my mother convinced me that it is better to start out in Engineering and then pivot to something else should I really hate engineering. The first two years were okay, but since my third year, I stopped doing my homework and projects and started getting into a dysfunction relationship which too up all my attention. I got through school by borrow/modifying code from classmates, and testing well due to being able to memorize facts without having deeper understanding of the subject matter. The worst is I did absolutely nothing during most of my co-op and I didn't even feel any shame of wasting companies time or resources.

After graduating from this software engineering degree, I was depressed from having gotten out of that dysfunctional relationship  and didn't even feel motivated to job hunt. I ended up going on to do a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering. Muddled through most of the coursework; feel super depressed during the thesis writing part though and could not put together anything. I spent my days trolling on discussion boards spying on the guy I had broken up with. Eventually things got really desperate my mother had to get her subordinate to help me to put together a prototype software. I eventually write a thesis based on usability testing of this prototype. I even published a journal paper, but I was super depressed. I remember going to some IEEE conference in San Francisco and feeling so disengage that I rolled my ankle at the conference hotel.

I didn't want to continue with a PhD because of this constant despair and feeling that I was playing a part that was not me. I ended up finding a job with a local tech company. After two years, I ended up in a software testing job and I slowly felt the despair creep back in. I started seeing a shink regularly but still couldn't put a finger on what was the issue. I entertained the idea of doing a degree in psychology but didn't have the guts then because what was I going to do with that and I didn't know where it would lead me.

I decided to do an MBA instead. Got into a top 30 program in the US due to my ability to test well. But did badly in my first year internship and had no idea what to do with this MBA. My only happiness was going to do an exchange program in China. By 2nd year, my social anxiety also really started showing up because we were about to leave the program and we are always around people and sometimes I'll leave a room in the middle of an event. I thought maybe I would write but never got myself to write consistently. By second year I fell into depression around the time I was about to graduate. 

School was ended and I had to get a job and so got one in software testing. It lasted two months and then I was fired because I sided with the client on some solution request. I didn't know where to go and was afraid to tell my mom (she had paid for my MBA) and so I ended up contacting a guy I met while I was on my exchange program. One thing lead to another and I ended up in China working in the education space for a business school. 

At first the work was fulfilling because I thought I was helping people figure out what they wanted to do with their life. But after two years, I realized that I was just a glorified English secritary and I started to hate my work and felt depressed again. During this time, I also had a regular therapist and I realized that I probably was dealing with some issues the way I was brought up.

Eventually, I couldn't stand my job any more, and my husband and I (the guy who had taken me in when I was fired), returned to the US. I had a break in my career to get my work permit, and then I was back to working higher education but not in career services. I don't have confidence I can help people find jobs in the US to be honest, because I myself had such a hard time.

I have now been working in program management in executive education for two years. It pays poorly for where we live and the job started out being interesting but now because we have moved back to in-person programs, I am starting to feel restless about it again. I hate looking at the food, the catering. The part I like about it is organizing the company speakers and setting up the presentations. But my inability to set up my boundary on what I like and dislike is making it hard for me to be successful. I feel like I am hindered in my attempts to compete in life. I have been passed for promotions and I feel generally discouraged and disengaged.''

I think I keep making these 'safe choices' but once the initial 'ability' part is proven, I ended up feeling miserable and disengaged. I am also not in good financial positions because I don't end up doing anything particularly well and doesn't add too much value to the team.

So here I am and not sure what to do. Is job switching actually going to make a difference? I am thinking about perhaps doing a (third) master's in psychology and switching into psychotherapist track, but the effort and the finances are daunting. My husband is currently out of a job. We have savings though and I don't have another to take care of but ourselves financially. My parents are both retired and they have the means to have a comfortable retirement but are psychologically feeling scared due to their own 'joblessness'. 

Looking forward to some sage third party advice.

findapath,promotion advice,Feeling like I've wasted my potential 4 years after graduation ,"Posting here because I haven't had much luck in previous subreddits and desperately looking for advice. 

I am a 26M still living with my parents. I graduated in 2020 from a top 25 public university with a B.S. in Mathematics with certificates in Computer Science and Applied Statistics with a 3.3 GPA. I wanted to do CS or an engineering discipline at my university however got denied for internal transfer. 

Fast forward, unfortunately I am not currently using my degree in my current job. I currently work in support and have been in the same role for 2 years. I get paid $23 / hr and work full time remotely. I absolutely despise the work dealing with rude customers on the front line all day. Career progression is extremely slow and all the managers care about is more about metrics and less about learning / promoting within. In my one on ones with my manager they do signal promises but they don't happen / happen very late. There are always a lot of moving pieces and nothing is clearly communicated between me and my peers. I have applied for jobs but have not had much luck getting in my foot in the door for jobs related to my degree in the tech field.

In addition to working, I decided to go back to school to get myself back on the career path of engineering or CS. I am taking two courses through a CC online to get the prereqs I missed in hopes of getting into a good master's program. I am also taking these classes to get back into school mode. I applied for admission to a decent local university for a master's program and got accepted months ago. However, due to my indecisiveness and financial reasons, I decided to defer admission to next Fall 2025. 

I feel like I've wasted my degree and potential but would like to redeem myself in a master's program. I started out at a community college before transferring to a university and struggled both academically and socially. I never was able to secure an internship and would like to give myself a second chance to seek these opportunities in graduate school which is why I am considering it. 

When I go on LinkedIn and see people with similar background as me with DS / SWE roles I feel like a failure for my degree. I know it's not good to compare myself to others but I just feel horrible being a math major working the same role as people who don't have college degrees / have degrees in non-STEM backgrounds.

I currently have $47K in savings and graduated college debt free. I am very frugal / don't go out much. I'd like to make the jump to quit my job a year from now and go back to school full time for a masters. My biggest concern is being back where I started due to my lack of experience in the field. My only other option is to grit my teeth and keep applying for jobs and work on projects or work my way up in my current company to an engineering or analytics position (which may take years). 

I'm currently at a crossroads with where I should go forward in my career. I know it's on me to determine my fate but any guidance or advice would be very valuable to me.",86,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1g35ze2/feeling_like_ive_wasted_my_potential_4_years/,1728872639.0,LPFanVGC,1g35ze2,advice_seeking

findapath,job offer negotiation,Job Offer with Tuition Coverage and a Commitment Clause—Is It Too Good to Be True?,"I (20F) work as an intern in a family owned testing laboratory. Currently I am a technician who works part time during the school semester, full time during breaks and the summer. It has been about 9 months.

Yesterday, my boss called me into the office and acknowledged all the stuff I've been juggling and posting on LinkedIn: school, work, extracurriculars, volunteering, etc. He mentioned how ambitious I've been and then dropped a pretty big offer.

He asked if I'd be willing to switch to full-time work and part-time school in Fall 2025 so that I can be trained more thoroughly to master the technician role and once I’ve got that down, he wants to give me an engineering title and have me start learning and working as an engineer. I would be writing reviews, looking at quotes, reading procedures, etc. He's offering to pay for my school, but with the condition that I stay for an additional two years after graduating. If I decide to leave before those two years are up, I’d have to pay back a prorated amount of the tuition.

I’m considering it because:

* It's job security.
* I’d get an engineering title faster than I might elsewhere.
* I can still finish school.

I’m also planning to negotiate for more pay if I go full-time, especially since I’ve been taking on a lot of extra responsibilities recently.

Here’s the thing—I’m feeling a bit hesitant about the offer. On the surface, it sounds great, and I plan to thoroughly review any documents and ask all the necessary questions. However, I can’t shake the feeling that it might be too good to be true. I’ve only been working here for nine months, and while I’ve been putting in a lot of effort and trying to learn as much as possible, the offer feels almost too generous.

One of my coworkers, who recently started school, accepted a similar offer after telling management he couldn’t work overtime due to night classes. He seems genuinely happy with the arrangement, which is encouraging, but I still have my doubts.

What do you think? Is this a good move? Any advice on how to handle the negotiation or things I should watch out for in this kind of agreement?",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1i2aqhh/job_offer_with_tuition_coverage_and_a_commitment/,1736982916.0,Cupy_,1i2aqhh,advice_seeking
findapath,job offer negotiation,"i made an extremely poor decision, am I doomed to menial work?","i'm 25F with a bachelor's degree in business. Since I graduated college in 2022, I have applied to more than 4,000 jobs and have been stuck in service work and temp admin positions. I've been in panic survival mode for an entire year trying to obtain W2 employment in another state.

I applied for, went 5 rounds and an IQ test for a $20 entry level operations position, in a city across the country i want to live in, with a tech company that actually really aligned with my interests. Everything aligned, even the job title. The entire process took 7 weeks. I got the offer. I was ecstatic. Of the 4,000 applications I've done, I can think of 5-10 companies I would actually love to have on my resume. This was one of them. I did everything right, I finagled that I was moving there, I got the PO box, I did EVERYTHING YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO DO WHEN GETTING A JOB OUT OF STATE.

I signed the offer on February 28th. Did not get the background check to sign until March 3rd or so. The background check was supposed to be done 7 days before my start date. It was not. I inquired daily, adamant that I would not move across the country without the background check clearing, given I have had multiple offers rescinded before at this stage and the company itself was in the news for laying off 20% of its workforce 2023-2024 and rescinded a hundred jobs. My faith in this was dwindling by the day and with each day it was delayed.

It took over 2 weeks for the background check to clear, and on the Wednesday before my Monday start date, Sterling asked for W2s. Given the company's recent news and the background check taking this long, I had to read between the tea leaves and my logic was telling me I didn't get the job. I've been burned before. I was panicking that this was headed in the wrong direction. At this point I still haven't bought the flight, but I'd been searching for over a week to no avail on the Facebook on groups for roommates and temporary housing. I was horrified that I would fly all the way down and they would rescind the job after I started, or I'd be fired within a few months anyway given the volatility of the company.

On Thursday night, they FINALLY told me I was cleared to start Monday. On Friday, they told me my laptop would be arriving that night or Sat morning. I was not in the state. My PO box wasn't open on Sundays when I was supposed to be there, so I had to negotiate getting it early on Monday but late (I'd be missing the first hour of onboarding). So they were about to find out that I didn’t have a permanent address still. At this point I'd already been panicking for days, sick to my stomach and having hot flashes from the stress and situation I was in.

In the end, I packed and bought my flight, and I didn't get on the plane. I sent a withdrawing email because I assumed they were going to rescind anyways (I had already red flagged them telling them I wasn't going to be able to pick up the laptop in time).

The regret and shame I feel right now is enormous.

I felt like I was dealt a nearly impossible hand, after a year unemployed I get hired by a company in a city I want to be in who uses a background check that takes more than two weeks (of the offers I've had before, no other background check has taken this long). It feels cruel. I used logic with what's happened to me before and this time my logic was wrong. I did everything right except get on the plane and live in a hotel for a week. Why didn't I do it? What the fuck is wrong with me? i have a degree i have not used in 3 years - I majorly fucked up. I could've been living a completely different life today. I'm desperate to leave my state.

3 years, 4,000 applications, and finally and out-of-state offer for $20. I WANTED THE JOB!!!

How do I get over this regret? Interviews are so few and far in between, the scarcity of entry level roles has left me in a complete panic. Even my dad was crying with me last night over how devastating this is. I'll always have to live with the what-ifs. I feel like I ruined my life and this is a major life regret I can't live with. I don't know what possessed me on Sunday. I had a way out and I let it slip through my fingers. The people I'm not going to meet now. The job I'm not going to get in the future because I didn't take this job. The domino effect is devastating and only I truly know how badly I needed this break.

I'm worried Im never getting another job again entry level with my degree. I'm worried it could be 6 months before I get another interview. I'm worried I blew my last ticket out of my state and my parent's house. I fucked up so bad, this was worth being homeless for in another state if I had to.

I've had multiple jobs rescinded before and because this job took so long with the background check I (incorrectly) read between the lines that this job was being rescinded too. It walked and talked like a job being rescinded and the company was in the media for laying off over 1,400 people the past year AND rescinding a hundred jobs

I was going to be homeless living in a hotel for 2-3 weeks and I have never moved across the country before, I had no housing, no contacts over there, no network and no support

they only gave me the job offer and BG check on the pretext that i had already moved down there, they made it so clear that it was going to be a dealbreaker if i had any inconvenience 

The time crunch they put me under because they thought I was already living there

It's my fault

i’m having heartbroken chest pains I'm at the end of my rope

I emailed them and expressed my regret and housing circumstances changed and they said thanks anyways but they are resuming the search for another candidate and reposted the job. they will probably get a May 2025 graduate and give them more flexibility than i was afforded 😞",58,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1jexkel/i_made_an_extremely_poor_decision_am_i_doomed_to/,1742392623.0,atravelingmuse,1jexkel,advice_seeking
findapath,job offer negotiation,"28f unemployed, AuDHD, treatment resistant depression, wtf do I do? 🥲","Greetings from the Great White North 🇨🇦

I’ll try and give some backstory without writing out an entire novel

I have multiple mental illnesses including treatment-resistant depression and AuDHD. I was a “smart” kid and I masked my issues very well throughout childhood. My mom was a critical, verbally/emotionally abusive tyrant so struggling and asking for help was not an option. 

Fast forward to 2015. I graduate and end up going to university because that's what the family wants me to do. At this point, I know I’m not ready to go, but I don’t have a choice. The family had been saving money for years to send me to university so I can’t just say no. (looking back at things, I was socially and mentally behind my peers.)

At this point, I managed to get through highschool as an A level student. (Except math, I have dyscalculia and I cried and convinced my math teacher to write an acceptable grade on my report card so my mom wouldn’t freak out at me. Horrible thing to do, I know.) So now I’m at university without any concept of how the real world works or what steps I need to take to secure a future for myself. I stayed for 4 years, eventually choosing “Environmental Studies” because I needed to pick fucking something, and I was tired of being accused of “staying in school for as long as possible so I can live at home forever.” In all my classes, I relied on my memorization skills to get through exams, and meticulously wrote papers to ensure I would get an A every single time. I was also working part time on all my days off so I was burning myself out while constantly being berated by my mother. 

Covid happens and shit hits the fan. I have to take statistics as a requirement and I literally can’t pass because of my dyscalculia. Failure is not and has never been an option for me, and I realized I wasn’t even going to university for myself. Once lockdown ended, I decided to work full time so I could save money and get away from my mom. Of course this is an issue so I just try and do my best. This was the first time I reached out to my doctor for a psych referral. 

 I finally moved out in 2023 and things were okay for a bit. My partner and I rented an apartment next to my work and everything seemed great for the first few months. I was working as an early childhood educator assistant (ECEA)  at the time and my bosses offered to enroll me in a provincial training program to get my full early childhood education license (ECE). 

Everything was going fine until my mental health started to plummet to a degree it had never reached before. I was coming home from work and crying everyday because of the overwhelm. I adjusted my meds and kept trying until September of 2023. The literal worst group of children in the 5 years I’d worked at that centre arrived for the start of the school year. I shit you not, every single child out of 25 had some sort of behaviour problem, and most of them required 1 on 1 support. My aunt also died around this time and I was dealing with the grief. I managed to stick with it for another year and finish my certification, but every single day I was hiding in the office or bathroom because I was having full-blown meltdowns at work. It got to the point where I was experiencing trauma-induced psychosis, so my doctor wrote me a note for medical leave in August of 2024. 

So where does this bring me today? I've been unemployed since August of 2024. I have no idea what to do at this point in my life, My nervous system DOES NOT WORK properly. I have decided working with children isn't for me, it’s too unpredictable and dysregulating. 

My other issue is that I have to see a therapist once a month, and meet with a psychiatrist every 3 months. I don’t have a timeline on when this will end as it’s dependent on my level of “healing” I guess you could say. I’ve tried applying for some part-time jobs near me and none have been able to accommodate these appointments. 

I am hoping to either use my existing skills, or take some courses that could potentially lead to self-employment or contracted work as I’m tired of explaining my mental health problems to employers. To be honest, I don’t even know if I'm capable of self employment. My self esteem is very low and I honestly require a lot of guidance which is embarrassing to admit. I tried becoming a UGC creator and while I'm great at making videos/script writing, the contracts and negotiations are something I really struggle with. When I worked at the daycare centre, I took on many administrative duties, registration/enrollment, centre tours etc. I also enjoyed curriculum/activity planning, and I'm really good at using Canva. These were the aspects of the job that brought me the most peace. I think I want to do something that involves social media, branding, marketing, etc, but from what I’ve read online it seems these careers are oversaturated and soon to become obsolete with AI.

 I feel lost, stuck, and useless. 


And I unfortunately still wrote a novel. 

TL;DR

I have treatment-resistant depression,AuDHD and a whole bunch of other mental illnesses. I masked my struggles very well because I didn’t have a choice. I went to university because my family expected it, despite being emotionally/socially behind my peers. I struggled with my mental health, eventually leaving school and working full-time at a daycare to escape my mom’s verbal/emotional abuse. After moving out in 2023, I got my Early Childhood Education certification, but faced severe burnout and mental health decline. I took medical leave in 2024 and have been unemployed since. I feel lost, unable to find work that accommodates my health needs, and struggle with self-esteem. I’m interested in social media, branding, and marketing but fear these careers are oversaturated and will be made obsolete with AI. Due to my mental health issues and nervous system dysfunction, I need to find a way to be self-employed.

findapath,job offer negotiation,Plan to quit - How did you prepare for and make the most of your time off before finding a new career?,"30F seeking advice. Those of you who have quit intentionally to take time off to recharge and soul-search for a new career path, what did you do to maintain a peace-of-mind financially and how did you hold yourself accountable to research career options and actually start a new job when you were ready? 

Want to quit ""soon"" due to burnout, but hestitant to pull the plug until I form a rough plan since I am on a work visa that typically requires people to leave the country 30 - 90 days (TBC) after resignation. I think I need more than 3 months off to recover, but would probably get bored if I took more than 1 year off. Looking to compile practical tips from others' experiences. 

**A few questions to start:**

1. What was the best thing you did for yourself during your time off?
2. How much of your savings (%) did you set aside to use for your break? Which categories were most worth spending on?
3. Any other personal finance tips? 
4. Did you give yourself a timeframe to resume working? If you couldn't stick to that timeframe, how did you adjust your plan? How did you avoid feeling guilty if you decided or inevitably needed to take more time off?
5. I don't like to feel like I'm wasting time -- how did you adjust this mindset and keep yourself motivated to continue ""soul searching"" and eventually begin job searching? (I anticipate struggling with intrinsic motivation once I don't have external structure from a day job, due to my ADHD. Would also need to get meds somewhere...)



**Background on my work situation:**

* Successful corporate job on paper.
   * Probably burnt out because I can't bring myself to do a half-ass job.
   * Promoted quickly within the company, to corporate title #4 out of 5. 
   * Moved to a different continent with the company to 1) have an accelerated career path, and 2) get out of my comfort zone on a personal level.
* Had always tried to be ""open-minded"" by taking on new challenges as a means to gain experience and grow, but have now reached a point where I am not gaining enough (financially, personally) for what I am asked to put in. 
   * I don't see myself growing further in my current role nor through an internal move, and the trajectory of my work scope no longer feels purposeful.
   * In the past \~year I've had to work 12-15 hours most days and it's go go go all day, the grind is not worth the sacrifices on my health, relationships, and youth.
* I *might* be able to negotiate for a few months sabbatical, but I'm pretty sure I don't want to return to this role anyway and might need more than a few months off from work.



**Personal factors & constraints for financial planning and living locations:**

* Parents, partner, and I currently live in 3 different countries. Without a valid work visa here, I can only reside long-term (more than 7 - 30 days) in my home country which is a 20 hour flight away from where my partner is.
   * I would visit my parents in my home country but don't want to stay with them long-term during my break, hence would need to spend money on accomodation even if I stay within my home country.
   * In a long-distance relationship due to my partner's work visa situation. Partner is supportive of me taking the opportunity to travel and not expecting me to stay with them long-term during my break (and I'd need a visa to do so).
   * I don't intend to find another job to stay in my current country unless my partner decides to return for a lucrative job offer (we should know within the next 1-2 months).
   * Partner and I are unmarried, no kids, discussing our long-term life plans and where we could both potentially live and work. Not much career opportunity for my partner in my home country, I also want to explore other places, so no set destination yet for my next relocation.
* Would like to travel a bit during my time off, but my passport requires visas for most destinations.
* I can break my lease with 2 months' notice or 2 months' rent.
* Have about 350K USD in savings.



TIA!!

findapath,job offer negotiation,"my family has offered to pay for a professional to help me find work, but i don’t know where to begin","tl;dr: my career in tech dried up and i genuinely have no idea whether and how my skills are useful anymore, and i’m afraid they aren’t. i’m 42 and i don’t know where to turn.

sorry, but i kinda have to tell a story to give enough background.

\- i helped to build the brand of a successful personal finance tech startup as one of their first 10 employees. after the company was acquired in 2015, I was forced out.

\- the way I was forced out was probably not legal, but more relevantly right now, the way i was forced out involved my supervisor telling me i’d achieved nothing, built nothing, that my contributions were subpar.

\- despite what that one supervisor said, the leadership of the company had credited me with much of what made their earliest days successful, but i had no idea what that was worth. this was my first tech job and I’m the first person in my family to have this sort of career. it’s only now that i realize that if I’d been more savvy and aware, I could have easily made a career of being one of the builders of this brand, which was well known in finance tech. many of my former colleagues have done exactly that.

\- at the time, the only thing i knew was that being in offices was hell (i have ADHD and was newly-diagnosed). i started my own consulting company, because at the time, that was the only way to ensure i could work from home

\- i faced illnesses and setbacks, but i eventually built a successful consulting business. i helped dozens of early-and mid-stage startups with marketing, operations, and customer service. i was a fractional operations/marketing person before the term ‘fractional’ existed. i helped many of those companies build their brands, too, and some of them are now big names.

\- in 2020, i was poached away from consulting by one of my clients, who was leaving their company to build something new. it seemed like a dream job.

\- it quickly became clear that what they actually wanted from me was my reputation from my first fintech job, to help with their fundraising pitch to potential investors. they did not want my expertise or experience, and dismissed me frequently when i offered the kind of input they’d ostensibly hired me for.

\- inevitably i was fired from there, in late 2021. i had also just found out that i had no choice but to sell my house (plumbing problems :( ).

by then, all of my clients from consulting were gone, and besides the company that had just fired me, it had been \~7 years since I’d had a company besides my own consultancy on my resume. the tech industry, especially fintech, was nosediving. it’s recovering somewhat now, but much of the tech industry is obsessed with AI and blockchain, stuff i have no experience with and about which i have always been very skeptical (and often rightly so!) with respect to finance tech. i am also a woman, which, yes, is still less than ideal in tech.

i’ve built marketing teams, customer service orgs, and consulted to founders. i don‘t write code; i’m a generalist, someone whose superpower is that they know how everything fits together, can organize people and projects, figure out roadmaps and priorities, understand technical and business problems, write well, negotiate, learn fast, creatively solve complex problems, etc. Just the sort of person who is no longer useful in the tech industry as they move toward more specialized roles. i’m in a spot where i have too much experience for more entry-level work, and not enough for things like chief of staff (although i think i’d be a great one, personally).

this means all the standard job-seeking advice about tailoring your resume and whatever is useless to me-–my value, the thing i really shine at, is the breadth and depth of my knowledge and experience, my ability to solve problems, and my strategic thinking. i went all-in on being a generalist early in my career, so no one skill on my resume is going to be terribly impressive on its own, no matter how good at it i am. i am as good a copywriter, for example, as anyone who’s been doing it their whole career would be, but i’ll never stack up to them experience-wise. not only that but the titles i \*have\* held are unimpressive, and i don’t have a lot of raw numbers to back up my successes, despite having achieved a lot. i really fell for that tech industry bullshit about not worrying about titles, being a team player, success being a group thing, etc. And a ton of my experience came from consulting gigs—not the traditional escalating titles with increasing responsibility that people look for. And not only THAT, but i also am happiest doing a lot of things—if i have my choice, i wouldn’t want to specialize even if i could. i have adhd, so i am only \*mostly\* in control of what my brain wants to focus on, and that’s on a good day. to some extent, i HAVE to find something that interests me, because otherwise i will be unhappy, stressed, and exhausted all the time as i spend all my energy trying to make my brain Do Job.

anyway, i truly do not know if my skills, experience, and achievements are worth anything anymore. i don’t know whether i can stay in my field, and i don’t know what i’d want to do if i can’t stay in my field. i love fintech, and i love the tech startup industry (as much as one can love being obliged to sell one’s labor in exchange for capital). i’ve been struggling for almost 4 years now, i’ve gone to all the meetups and contacted the linkedin connections and applied, applied, applied. i’m so sick of telling my loved ones i’m trying. i only barely believe it most of the time. i would be happy to take any job that would pay me, but the thought of going back to making like $40k a year and struggling, after a career where i fought hard to achieve enough to live comfortably, just makes me feel hopeless. i’m sorry if i sound like an asshole for saying that.

how do i find a headhunter/job-search professional who can help someone who doesn’t fit neatly into boxes? how can i learn whether my skills and experience are useful or not? and what else can people with generalized skillsets like mine do? where do i even start, if my skills are truly worthless now? my resume will never represent what i’ve achieved, so how do i get a job that matches my skills if a resume is simply not the best way to show what i’ve done?

findapath,job offer negotiation,Benefits of a Masters in Business Management with a Bachelors in 3D Animation,"Hey guys - 

I wanted to get some outside opinions and figured this might be a good place to ask. I'm a 3D Artist and with the CG industry being what it is at the moment, I’ve been strongly considering making some sort of pivot or adding on an additional masters degree. The one I’m most seriously thinking about right now is a MM business master’s in Organization Management.

Things to consider:

* Tuition cost is not a huge factor in this decision, I’m lucky enough that my home country offers university studies at a very affordable prices. Still this is an important choice that I want to consider carefully
* The course would take 1.5 years, can be be done remotely and paused if necessary
* I have an existing bachelor's degree in 3D Animation, Media & Communication
* Currently I’m more or less regionlocked to my current location, given that there’s only so many industry hubs when it comes to 3D. My hope is that maybe, if I manage to segue into a broader field, it would offer me way more options when it comes to living in different parts of the world 
* I have previous experience with organization, team management, leadership and mentoring

Concerns:

* My main goal is to find something that would hypothetically synergize well with my previous career experience working in animation production. It would be nice not to have to restart my career completely, even if it’s just so I present myself as an established professional
* My main concern is future financial stability and job security. I’m alright with moving away from CGI into any other industry that would provide this 
* I would also like to prioritize something that would hopefully be AI future proof. I know that some of these things are likely to become automated with time, but I can also imagine that sensitive company data and important corporate decisions will still require human oversight

The course in question would include a focus on, amongst other things:

* Leadership
* Corporate governance
* Project management
* Business communication and negotiation
* Positive work environments
* Applied finances for managers
* Human resources 

I would love any and all advice and opinions, especially from those of you who may have a background in similar fields. Is there anything I’m not considering? Anything you would suggest instead? What would be the best path forward?

Thanks a lot for your help!",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1l8x439/benefits_of_a_masters_in_business_management_with/,1749659221.0,Rottuskott,1l8x439,advice_seeking
findapath,how to get promoted,I'm 38 and I'm realizing that I've wasted my life ,"I'm 38, I'm a father to 3 kids a 7 year old and twin 3 year olds.  I've been with the same company for the last 10 years.  It's a small software company.  I started out in their technical support department.  After a few years I was promoted to team lead. and in 2021 I was promoted to manager of the support department.  There previously wasn't a manager position they created the position for me. 

I'm realizing over the last few years I haven't done anything. For starters, I'm a terrible manager.  I don't work. And I know that sounds hyperbolic but I really don't do anything.  Any escalations from the support team get handled by the leads.  I've been so removed from the day to day processes that I don't even know how to do the job of the people I manage.  I haven't gotten any certifications.  I don't do anything that managers should do on paper.

I'm really just a lazy piece of shit.  I've been told that I'm depressed.  I'm also bipolar so treating depression is tricky. 

I've been scouring job listings for the last few months and nothing jumps out as something I can do.  Or something I would even want to do.  My wife told me the other day that if we could afford it I could just be a stay at home dad but financially that isn't possible right now.  

I have no idea what I want to do, what interests me.  I look back on the last 10 years and see how many of my friends have advanced their careers and I'm just starting over.

I am unemployed because I lost my teaching job because of how bad the school was. I feel like I’ve wasted many years of career building because I don’t land good jobs and leave after about a year. 

I graduated with an MS in Geography at 27 because I spent 6 years in undergrad. Took a low paying job after that and have kinda bounced around in low level roles ever since. I didn’t work from 2020-2023 because I was fixing up my house and getting deep into hobbies. Accumulated $150K of credit card debt that I discharged last year through bankruptcy. Luckily I bought a house in Denver in 207 that I’m up about $220K on. 

But I have no other wealth besides this. Very small 401K, not much savings, never had a good job, never been promoted or got a bonus just one boring job to another. 

I recently started dating a girl that makes about $200K per year and comes from a wealthy family. She is gorgeous and loves me, but I’m starting to worry if I will ever be able to match her level of success. 

I have lots of talent, I have traveled to 30 countries and 50 states, I can cook, play piano, fix stuff, I’m in good shape, my family is Okay. My life is fine but I can’t help but feel behind. I feel like a loser sometimes and I just want to find a job I like or start a business and earn a good income. I see so many people my age that earn six figures or more and I just don’t even believe that’s possible for me. I’m planning to sell my house and move to CT with my girlfriend, and she is excited to start a family with me. This is exciting, but I don’t feel like I have the discipline to work hard and not get fired, earn a good income, and be a good provider. 

I would never have been able to hold onto a girl like this 10 years ago, but my twenties and early thirties have been a blast and I’ve healed from childhood trauma and regulated my emotions. I may have ADHD but I don’t know. I’ve never been prescribed drugs but I am a machine on Adderall, and I wish I could be productive like that all the time. 

I just feel like so many people my age have their life figured out and have money, and I don’t feel that way and never have.

findapath,how to get promoted,"34, living paycheck to paycheck, burnt out, losing hope","Ugh, you guys. I am so over the relentless nature of life. 

Long story short, I had a horribly traumatic childhood/adolescence/young adulthood. I managed to graduate college with a BA and enter the workforce, but not without picking up one hell of an opiate addiction. 

I kicked dope when I was 28, and by then I was finally feeling like I had really started taking control of my life. Despite my addiction I had managed several raises and promotions at my job, and once I quit dope I had all this extra money. I started saving. I learned how to drive / got a car. I got a dog and a girlfriend and started making friends. Things were looking up for the first time ever. 

Then boom, I got laid off from my job. I was unemployed for 3 months and took the first job I could get bc I’m so scared of living in poverty again/not to mention the pandemic. The job is brutal—$12k pay cut, I work all holidays/weekends, it’s outdoors, it’s manual labor, no real room for advancement.

I’ve been trying to find a different job, one that was like my old one/where I can utilize my actual skill set, but fucking NO ONE is responding. The job market is saturated with people who are just as or more qualified than I am. It’s been a year and a half of radio silence. Honestly I don’t even think half these job postings are real at this point.

Then, during that transition, the house I was renting became uninhabitable, I had to move. Then I totaled my car on my way to work. Now I have to have a biopsy to see if I have fucking CANCER. By now, I’ve burned through all my savings and I’m living paycheck to paycheck. Any kind of emergency would launch me face first into debt.

It’s like… what the fuck was the point of getting sober? What was the point of me getting just a taste of normalcy and comfort, just to have it ripped away?

I just feel myself slipping back into abject poverty, illness, and depression. Like it was stupid of me to ever think I could escape the shitstorm that’s followed me like a fucking curse.

My husband  either got transferred because of promotion or have gotten new job almost every 2.5 years and we always moved to New city. I used to work before my marriage but due to all transfers, i stopped trying after 4 years. Then we became parents and I couldn't leave my kid at home and take a job.

I am not trying to find job, I am just trying to find a goal which can give me some sense of progress. I feel like a kite whose rope is cut and now flies where wind takes it. My husband is loving and supportive. He hasn't stopped me but he is not able to help me out when I say this and feels too bad that due to his work i feel like this. I know this because he really loves me and he feels helpless.

By god's grace and I am extremely grateful for the life he has given us, I am not complaining. I will feel better if had a vision or goal to which I can work for longer time besides my family and home. I have tried working for ngos but it wasn't something I was looking for. I want to do something for myself.

findapath,how to get promoted,Feel like such a loser,"I’m 29 and I had to move back home with my parents.  I got laid off from the one job that let me move out when I was 26 a year ago and I haven’t gotten anything besides one gig as a scare actor since.  I have ADHD and autism which makes things especially difficult- even if I manage to land another 9-5, I’ll get burnt out and hate it in another 6 months and if I’m lucky I’ll *maybe* find something new for the cycle to repeat.

I try to go out when I can.  I live close to nyc so I’m lucky in that regard, but every time I leave the house it costs me $30 minimum lol.  I’ll do free things like going on walks, but then I’m just thinking about how pretty much everyone else my age and significantly younger than me is working at a job that they actually have and will ideally keep.  I have one or two friends in similar boats so it feels better in that regard, but I still feel like such a fucking failure.  I know it wasn’t my fault, that I got laid off because of “department restructuring” and the whole damn office closed like 9 months later, but everyone I know who I got laid off with and everyone I know who got laid off after has a new job.  Some of them found one within a few weeks.  I can’t get anything, though.  Even with recommendations and referrals and nepotistic shit like that, I’m SOL.

And I’ve spent this time trying to improve myself in other areas.  I tried new hobbies, tried to make new friends, and I’ve actually somehow because a pretty popular fanfic writer for one of my favorite video game series.  But everything I enjoy doing is in the arts.  I need the stability of a steady income or I won’t feel secure, but those jobs aren’t exactly possible as a writer or an actor or a tarot reader (I’m not a scammer, I actually know how to read and analyze the cards).  Even then, I can never stick with it.  I’ll try to write something original, I’ll have the ideas for it and I’ll obsess over it for weeks and then I’ll write maybe a page or two and be over it.  I’ve written a few stand-up bits, but I know I can’t exactly make a career out of it any time soon.  So my only real option is to find another shitty job that I’ll hate.  And I know that’s what literally everyone has to do, but I just can’t get it through my head.  My autism gives me a very strong sense of justice and fairness.  I was told growing up that if I work hard, I could do anything I want with my life.  I’ve worked my ass off all through school and I auditioned for everything under the sun.  I bought a website domain and promoted my tarot services as much as I possibly could and I got nowhere with it.  I still do all of these as hobbies, but it’s a bandaid over a bullet wound kind of deal.

My point is I feel so fucking cheated for working so hard and being the best I can possibly be at anything I put my mind to, and I get nothing out of it.  I know it’s not all my fault and the economy’s trash and gig work has literally always been this way and there’s nothing I as one person with $45 in my bank account can do about it.  I know all of that.  And it just makes me more unhappy.  Like there’s always going to be a hole that’ll never be filled.  My mom wants me to go back to school and get a masters but for what?  The only things I enjoy doing aren’t exactly job magnets.  Otherwise, there’s literally nothing I like or care about enough or am good enough at to spend all that time and money studying it.  I can either be broke and miserable or broke and miserable with homework.  I’m not good at math or science or data or coding or anything remotely profitable in the current job market.  I tried, but my learning disability do be disabling me.

Idk what I’m writing all of this for.  To get it out of my head?  To commiserate?  To get attention and write another similar post where I regurgitate the same points and repeat the cycle?  Maybe.  I don’t feel better after writing this, just like an attention whore who loves to complain - which I am, so fair enough.

I moved to a new city. I had bartended my way through college and I just took the path of least resistance. Ended up working at a coffee shop/deli. Covid hit, and weirdly the place I worked did really well and it felt like a good job during the pandemic. Got a small promotion so I make like 45k a year, enough to be split an apartment and be slightly comfortable where I live, but not enough to save for anything. 

Now I don't know what to do. Costs are rising faster, student loan payments are probably about to start back up. Honestly as a little kid I kind of dreamed about just working a normal job in a city like I am but it's 2025 not 1995 and I don't feel safe or secure at all. 

I feel like my 'resume' is a liability. Like ""look at this idiot he got a good degree and then just f'd off for 6 years, we don't want a layabout like him.""

Grad school? I could imagine going back to university but the idea of re-leveraging everything and taking on more debt freaks me out. And I don't have a dream job/program. Plus getting in at this point would be a challenge because all my letter of recommendation connections etc. have expired, I'm super detached from that world. 

So I'm thinking:

Trades? Electrician or plumber maybe? Ideally I don't want to work construction but I could.Anyone out there doing non- construction electrical work? My concerns here are stability/seasonality of employment.

Or Medical? Certification as x-ray tech, pt assistant, etc. Feels like more schooling/debt, but still less than university and potentially more stable. 

Would love to hear from anyone who has entered those fields, what it's like to start out, how much stress they're under, how stable they feel. 

Also wondering if anyone has been in a similar spot and what direction you took from there.

findapath,toxic workplace,I keep ending up in workplaces  with a toxic company culture  (F28),"I work for a company right now as a contractor, doing design work for them. I don’t have any benefits, it’s simply a paycheck they’re providing me with. Recently, they told that they have budget restraints, and need to cap my salary at 2k a month. I live in an expensive area, and that is well below a living wage. Although I’m a “just a contractor,” they have treated me like a full-time employee - giving me endless work and urgent requests at a moments noticed. I’ve completed those requests because I really like most of the people I work with….But now, I feel completely unappreciated and used. 

I feel like my eyes are fully open now. There is also so much finger pointing and putting blame and others at this company. They use a communication channel to converse, and they publicly call out and humiliate people in public channels with at least 20 other ppl. I’m realizing it’s just not a healthy culture at all. 

This isn’t the first time I’ve ended up at a company with a toxic company culture. Some people I’ve talked to have said to me, that’s just how it is. Others have said asking for a workplace that values politeness and simply being professional in the workplace isn’t a lot to ask. And I can find that. How does one find a company with a HEALTHY company culture?

findapath,toxic workplace,"24F, Feeling like I failed in life.","I graduated from college two years ago and was fortunate enough to land my first job as a local agent in the diplomatic sector. The pay and benefits were okay, and it served as a good steppingstone for future job hunting. After working in this job for 1.5 years, I couldn’t manage the toxic senior management, so I quit and decided to chase my dream of becoming a flight attendant. I was hired by the airline I had always dreamed of. I started training, which was tough but rewarding, as I knew I was one step closer to my dream. I was doing what I loved and met a group of classmates with similar interests.

Unfortunately, after one month of training, I failed my safety assessment despite my hard work and was let go by the company immediately. I was very upset, feeling like I had failed my dream and doubting my abilities, as I never expected to fail the training. The bad news is that the company will never consider hiring me again.

So, I became unemployed and job-hunted for two months before landing a job in a university office. I hated it from the first day, but I knew I had no choice but to stay, which made me feel even worse. I kept crying every day over everything that had happened. I continued looking for jobs, but the market was unresponsive; I only got a few interviews but didn’t succeed.

I regretted giving up my job in the diplomatic sector, as I had been okay with the work, pay, and benefits. I realized I was too naïve to quit a job just because I didn’t like a person in the workplace. Aviation is no longer a consideration for me. Despite the fact that the company won’t take me back, I can’t afford to take any risks in losing a job again.

findapath,toxic workplace,"23, crippling uncertainty, AMA?","hello everyone. i just joined this sub and I don't post often, but I need to talk to someone about this so I hope I don't break any rules/write too long of a post.

I'm 23 and live in Italy. I grew up in a blue collar family in a not very rich environment. I was always surrounded by art and music though, and my family loved the outdoors, so I always had these three basic things always in my interest.

I started studying music when I was in middle school and it quickly became a 'resting place' for me. I was struggling mentally with various undiagnosed disorders, but I really thought music would be the thing to make me pull through. in my teens I had a few bands, played shows, won one or two local contests, etc. but my mental state couldn't keep up with it. I hated performing, but it felt like it was the only thing I was good at, so I just kept going. then when I was about 18 I had one of the worst depressive episodes of my life. I basically had a breakdown and since then I haven't been able to pick up an instrument.

I finished high school and tried to choose a college I liked. failed. needed a job, so I became a line cook in what I would soon realize is one of the most toxic workplaces I've ever seen. quit just shy of six months ago.

tried again and changed univeristies, now I'm on year one (year two in september) of environmental science. I like it, but to be completely honest I feel too stupid to make it in STEM. I'm lagging behind, my disorders never seem to give me a break and I'm considering quitting that too. I'm currently working in a supermarket and I'm scared this is what it's gonna be for me. for the rest of my life.

I'm not sure what I'm looking for, writing this post. guidance maybe, or just a sort of common ground with someone else who might relate.

findapath,toxic workplace,Winding down my 30s and need to figure out how to spend my life,"Hi! Apologies if the flair is wrong, I'm not sure I totally understand the differences. Basically, I'm trying to figure out what to do with myself. I was a super bright kid and a perpetual straight-A student, but the real world hit me like a sack of bricks and I never really regained my footing. 

I'm a 37-year-old woman living in California. I have a bachelor's degree in film production (minor in psychology), but realized quickly after graduation that that wasn't for me. I had a couple of low-level film industry jobs after graduating, and for the past 9 years I've had a data entry job at sort of an entertainment industry database company. The company is toxic and offers no growth (my job is basically the same as when I started), and I am desperate to leave. But in my professional life I haven't cultivated any skills beyond the normal office stuff that everyone can do, or pretends they can do. On paper I'm a terrible candidate for anything, as I've only ever had entry-level jobs, I don't have hard skills, my soft skills aren't provable, and I'm getting pretty old for entry level gigs. I worked with a career counselor a couple years ago on massaging my resume / cover letter, but you can only put so much lipstick on a pig. On top of that, recent events have caused the entire entertainment industry to really contract. I'm open to staying in this industry if I can, but it doesn't look good. I have zero dreams and I'm at a total loss for what to do with myself.

The good: I'm drawn to being creative (not actual art though), helping people, psychology, research/data/fact-checking/proofreading, optimization/efficiency/life-hacking. I'm insanely organized and started planning my family vacations when I was still a kid. I'm good at earning people's trust, and perceptive about what is going on with them. I'm a [super-recognizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_recogniser), though that doesn't really have corresponding career paths in the US like in the UK. I'm definitely smart, as previously mentioned; I even competed on Jeopardy. Friends joke that it's easier to just ask me something than Google it. Due to an insatiable need for attention, I also drawn to activities that put me in the spotlight: dancing, public speaking, stand-up comedy (but I'm bad at - and disinterested in - acting). I have the resources to make continued education a possibility.

The bad: Math/science/anything super technical is a hard no; my brain simply doesn't work that way. I'm extremely scrupulous/ethical/honest, which I'm putting under ""bad"" but I guess can go either way. If I really like or believe in something, I'm very persuasive and enthusiastic. But if I don't, I'm just gonna tell you to go buy from the competitor. Another one that can go either way is that I am extremely astute at anticipating every possible thing that could go wrong. I am told this can potentially be a skill, but in reality it's just a bummer and people want you to shut up.

The ugly: I've struggled with depression starting in middle school, and while I'm medicated, in therapy, and married to someone wonderful, it's still a struggle most days. I'm ""high-functioning"" in that it doesn't prevent me from going about my routine, but it can be a major barrier to positive change and it deeply informs how my brain works. Additionally, I got diagnosed with autism a few years ago. Like the depression, I can hide it quite well, but it hurts me more than it affects other people. Occasionally I don't mask sufficiently in the workplace and it causes problems. This makes me reticent to pursue something like becoming a therapist, because I am definitely not in tune with how ""normal"" people function, and the idea of advising them feels reckless and irresponsible. 

So concludes my tale of woe. Any guidance or ideas would be much appreciated, thank you for reading!",19,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1jp487u/winding_down_my_30s_and_need_to_figure_out_how_to/,1743535218.0,julieses,1jp487u,advice_seeking
findapath,toxic workplace,Dunno What To Do At This Point,"I feel like my back is against the wall in terms of career options and I don't know how to even attempt moving forward. I’ll be turning 35 this year and I’ve felt this way for years (approx 5) now, despite having my Master’s, being an artist/content creator, and having varying degrees of experience/skills in a handful of fields/hobbies. The field I studied and went into student debt for (media) is in shambles and every attempt I’ve made to find alternative job options adjacent to or even completely outside that field have fallen through. It’s wild, because when I first started considering the field I wanted to study for grad school (Media Studies), I felt like it was practically a “fail proof” field to go into at the time: there were so many directions I could take my studies in, so many different job opportunities, so much technology being developed. Nobody - certainly not me - could have predicted the three combo punch that would be the pandemic, the Writer’s/SAG strikes and the effect AI would have on media and content creation. Like sure, the media industry isn't fully **dead** in the water, but it's not exactly looking too great either.

Coupled with the general consistent bad luck of both global and personal events back to back, I’ve experienced multiple setbacks that would cripple even the most prepared of graduates. And to be clear, I haven’t been wallowing in a “woe is me” mentality for the last five years and it hasn't all been awful. At one point (in 2022) I was working in production (film/tv) and started moving up in the world only to one day text about when I would be needed in the office next and suddenly get radio silence from my bosses. I don’t even know if it was something I did wrong bc I was never technically fired, they literally ghosted me.  I was down for a bit about it but I’ve always been resourceful about finding a way around obstacles so when the production stuff fell through, I got training as a bartender to at least be able to support myself. That ended up with me working at a service bar where I did all the labor of a bartender and a barback without the benefits of at least earning tips. Even with the skills I learned, actual bars wouldn’t hire me because I worked in a service bar and didn’t have the customer service experience, which was incredibly discouraging to learn. Eventually, my employment was terminated when my shoulders were injured on the job work and I was unable to bartend for over a month straight.  While I was in the process of filing worker’s comp, since I hadn’t worked in 45 days, my employment was terminated - per company policy. A lovely shit cherry on top of rest of the shit sundae I’ve been consistently served. 

Since then, I’ve been hired and then lost my job in quick succession twice for very different reasons. The first was at a small cosmetic company in my city that ran more like ANTM than a legit job. They literally hired me, said they would train me (paid) and then two weeks into that training they decided I wasn’t a good fit to continue training. Which fair, that was technically a mutual choice at that point because the vibe was really off there. It was giving toxic workplace energy, which set off my anxiety in a way that was not just new job jitters. Then with the last job this year, a family friend basically put in my resume in the pile at the job and I impressed the interviewers enough to land it. I was beyond excited despite it not being in a field of choice because it felt like I was finally getting my stride. Until my sciatica re-entered the picture and the supervisor I was assigned to decided to pull some ableist and discriminatory bs (granted, not in a legally provable way bc he was smart about it). The sciatica pain got so bad from the anxiety and stress of what I was dealing with I couldn’t sit or stand and had to basically resign for the sake of my wellbeing, which put more strain on my already tense home life with my family, as well as this family friend. 

I’m also now so disabled by my prior injuries/issues that I can't work labor intensive jobs in retail or food service, beyond the fact that I’m over educated and qualified for those kinds of jobs anyway. I’m also neurodivergent - ADHD but suspected to be AuDHD - so those kind of jobs in addition to physical burnout, often given me mental burnout as well. I’m still heavily in debt because of grad school and I have no job to even work on paying that off while I wait for the world to stabilize -if it ever does. I feel like I have no options to move forward and it’s getting really hard to fight off feeling worthless. Even if you just have words of encouragement or commiseration rather than suggestions, I need them because my own family doesn’t believe in me anymore and I’m losing what little faith I’ve gained in myself. Send help pls 🥲



TL;DR (I know, I wrote fuckton lmao): I don’t know what to do for work anymore and despite my skills, experience and knowledge, I feel out of options to support myself esp bc of my disabilities/neurodivergence.

findapath,toxic workplace,career questions,"Hey everyone,

I’m currently in the process of applying for a new job, and I have a couple of questions that I hope you can help me with.

First, does it really matter what day of the week or time of day you send your CV or application? I’ve heard some people say it’s best to send it in the morning or early in the week to improve your chances of getting noticed. Is that true, or is it just a myth? What if I am sending it in weekend?

Second, I’m wrapping up my contract at my current job—tomorrow is actually my last day. If I send out my CV today in weekend, should I put on my resume that I’m still employed there, or should I state that I’m about to leave or that I’ve already left? I want to make sure I present myself in the best possible light, especially since my experience is pretty limited.

For context: After finishing my master’s degree, I did some internships, but then I had a two-year sabbatical. I recently landed a job in my field, but it turned out to be a very toxic workplace, and I had to leave after my six-month probation period and they announced me 1 week before the end of it...

I’m determined to do whatever I can to increase my chances of getting noticed and finding a good opportunity, so any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1kzvjqr/career_questions/,1748693270.0,gabby9224,1kzvjqr,advice_seeking

findapath,toxic workplace,Holland code artistic investigative,"I got tested by a professional and I scored high in arts and investigative categories(A.I). So I tried using the occupation outlook handbook OEWS to see whats popular in my area but it was dizzyingly complicated and not user friendly. I have had my rights violated, toxic workplaces, and I've been assaulted at multiple past jobs by customers. Self preservation is high on my list, I am trying to avoid being disrespected again. I have PTSD from one of my jobs.

I am the breadwinner for the last few years and Im bummed about being the only one bringing in any cabbage. I live in the middle of nowhere, so I have to do something in the meantime just to pay the bills. Out of desperation, I interviewed and got a job waiting for me next month at a care home supporting individuals with disabilities. The frequency and pay is meh considering how much humans are worth to any given company, per hour. I am unsure if I would find anything but homesteading and hydroponics to be fulfilling, so thankfully I can do this at home in my free time. Im afraid if I try to do art for work, I won't want to create. Like that study where kids were given play money incentive, then it wasn't fun anymore.

I have some college under my belt, but no degree. Nothing really speaks to me. I have done video production, farming, food service, retail, caregiving, light mechanical, and dispatch. Even after learning what some A.I. options are, Im unsure where to go. Journalism sounds cool, but I ask tough questions so I'd probably get shot. Im also extremely poor, so college might not be an option unless I can get scholarships. I prefer accelerated courses and OJT, if possible. Full time work sounds like a waste of living, unless its extremely meaningful, like for a charity.

Im about to be 33 and I am so lost when it comes to choosing what to go into. I prefer gigs, non traditional employment. I have aspergers and ADHD. I spoke with a charity company thats trying to find me accomodating employment,  but it can take a year, and they're primarily in the metro. Rural areas are really sparse in terms of opportunity except manufacturing and large scale factory farm monoculture/agriculture. I could likely go to the next state thats five miles away, but Id probably have to pay taxes in both which seems like a scam.

findapath,systemic burnout,Are you INVESTING your time WISELY?,"The common phrase we use is ‘spending time’, such as: I spent a lovely weekend with my family, I spent a whole evening watching Netflix, I spent all last week studying for the finals. Now this doesn’t seem like a problem at first but if we swap the word ‘spent’ with ‘invest’, we can now gauge how usefully we are using our time,  as investing brings a return while spending does not.  

So why does this matter? Well one way we can view the sections that make up our lives is like that of the sections of a train, with the engine being the most important part, the part we dedicate the majority of our time to and what dictates where are lives are heading, what kind of journey we are experiencing - what kind of story we are acting out. The carriages are all the other things we may want to fill our lives with: you could have a relationship carriage, one or more for various hobbies and maybe one for running a side business.

When we view our lives from this perspective we can see how our time really should always be invested in either the engine or one of these carriages, if we are doing anything else like scrolling social media or gorging on too much entertainment, then that’s time we aren’t investing into our train and instead spending - as there’s no return.

So what have you put your time into this weekend? If it has been on things you value, things that are bringing a positive return in your life in some way then that’s fantastic! If not then maybe it’s time to reassess where your time is going, what kind of state is your train in currently? Your story is uniquely your own and there is no ‘RIGHT’ way to do things, only you can judge if you’ve invested your time wisely.

findapath,systemic burnout,Im 24 and lost on what to do with my life. I know I don't want to work 9-5 sitting all day because of my health. how do I actually find a job that I like but afford the lifestyle I want...?,"What are graphic design/ creative jobs that are more artistic and less commercial? and has decent pay and good worklife balance for those with chronic pain/ tension and illness? im burnout  
  
I've also considered doing counselling, therapy, teaching , naturopathy, related to people and wellness work, since it requires less sitting and mouse computer work like design...   
  
but that would require studying degree again or masters... which I don't prefer... and science and math has not been my favourite subject. I like it when things are practical and more hands on not just theory, which im concerned those subjects would be like that in the end.   


I recently graduated with a degree in graphic design, but I’m realizing most jobs are highly commercial—focused on marketing, profit, and long screen time, which worsens my chronic pain. I also have, IBS, fatigue, crohns but recently in remission, lot of other somatic and immune system symptoms)

Graphic design is not what I expected. I chose this path thinking I would have a lot of creative freedom like the projects I do in university and because I liked illustration. But now I feel disconnected from the work. It feels more about selling for profit and admin work than creating meaningfully.

I’m still passionate about creative work, but I want something more expressive, artistic, and hands-on—less profit-driven and screen-heavy. I’m drawn to roles like:

* Set/production design
* Film and concept art
* Book cover or children’s book illustration
* Experiential/exhibition design
* Interior design
* Artisan crafts or even food/pastry-related creative fields
* psychology/ therapy/ counselling/ art Therapy/ art teaching, workshops, etc . (but prefer not to go back and study 4+ years and masters for this. Is there another way to learn this? for example people who work to resolve chronic pain can be fitness trainers and don't need to have physio degree ) but still have.lot of relevant and useful knowledge)

I like analog and real-world creation more than digital-only work.

**Questions:**

1. Are there creative jobs where storytelling, expression, and hands-on creation are more valued than marketing?
2. Has anyone transitioned from graphic design into more artistic fields like film, illustration, or interior/set design? What was your journey like?
3. Are there design roles where other teams handle budgets/marketing, while the designer focuses on the craft?
4. Has anyone else overcome burnout from trying to manage anxiety and chronic pain/ tension and illness with career, work. I am so overwhelmed with the amount of bare minimum things I already do and then having to find time/ energy (that I don't have) for upskilling and working on financial goals, business and focus on making a lot of money in order to get out of being trapped in this chronic pain situation that is affecting everything in my life and work performance...

Any personal experiences or insights would really help. Thank you!

Honestly I don't really know what I am doing with my life. All I know is that my problems will be solved and I will be much much happier if I had all my health issues and symptoms resolved. And to do that practically I need to have a lot a lot of money. Meaning in order to be happy and at peace and finally pain free I would need to have a lot of money. How else am I going to afford to rest and heal and have less anxiety knowing the money will run out and not be able to afford treatments and finally feel like I am able to rest in peace with financial stability. Im thinking millions (for my personal achievement goals) so I can have the highest chance to find a solution to my symptoms and afford to keep on finding and trying therapies and modalities.

findapath,systemic burnout,How can I address the feedback that I don't take enough intiative or responsibility at all?,"I'm (31M) someone who is about to get their PhD in Experimental Psychology in August and have been active on Reddit for the past 3 years after a fallout between me and my first PhD advisor during the qualifier portion of my program. For those curious about my field, I don't do therapy but I focus on research solely. Ever since the fallout, I've come to Reddit a bit to get outside advice as I don't exactly have a solid support system for getting into academia at the terminal degree level. I do have a therapist and a coach who I've meet once every two weeks for the past two years, but even they have limitations as far as knowing the intricacies goes.

For the past couple of years, a lot of posts of mine have had the reception that I don't take a lot of individual responsibility for my actions, put my responsibilities on others, and don't take enough initiative. Even after nearly half a year has gone by with folks giving me this feedback, I have no perception or clue how to take action based on that feedback. It's not necessary to read in full, but if you want concrete examples of posts I'm talking about and comments that reflect this, check out the PhD subreddit and the post, ""Potential hot take. How are situations where students flounder allowed to happen?"" as well as the GradSchool subreddit post, ""How are situations where students flounder allowed to happen? (asking for this sub's perspective)."" Both posts have the same content, just different titles. There is also a bonus post in the Autistic Adult subreddit called ""Trying to overcome coddling I've had as a kid and an adult. How can I do so?"" back when I bought into the impression that I was coddled by other uses on here. Now, I'm not so sure anymore and think it's a perception thing.

I tagged this under seeking advice since I'm uncertain if my blindness of how to implement the feedback into my life is related to my conditions or not at all. In case this information is relevant, my recent re-evaluation at 29 did state I have below average self-direction skills. However, I was listed as possessing above-average skills to get through activities of daily living such as shopping and whatnot.

For those who might be wondering, ""How can this guy not know something and not realize it?,"" or ""How is his self awareness so bad?,"" it's been the case with me ever since I was younger and to this day that I'm a highly anxious person who likes to cover their bases as much as possible. My therapy as a teen and support I had from a life coach all four years of undergrad encouraged me to let go of those anxious tendencies. It may be possible that I cut too far in the other direction. I was told by my life coach that I think in black and white a lot so that may have been the case. It's also been the case ever since I was younger that I minimized a lot of commitments if I was already overwhelmed by whatever kept me occupied at the time (i.e., college, work, etc.), which is consistent with autistic burnout in particular. Even though I had an ACT score in the 90th percentile (29), 3.7+ unweighted GPAs in my high school (no AP, IB, honors, or foreign language courses granted) and 26 dual enrolled credit hours, I got thrashed at the ""stoner college"" of my state I attended because of the good merit scholarships they gave me and was in their Honors College before I dropped from it to get a regular Bachelor's.

So, is it a neurodivergent tendency to not know something and somehow not realizing it yourself? More importantly, how can I address the feedback that I don't take enough initiative or responsibility at all? For me, I'm extremely as to how my peers in graduate school somehow picked up on all of the customs and unwritten rules so quickly and what they did to get there. As for why I never asked a lot of questions, it's because I've had a bad history of asking questions to professors and other faculty that weren't well received at all because it came across as me not reading or paying attention at all. Yet, I was encouraged to keep asking questions and pulling aside people who I've annoyed previously and that just makes no sense to me. Yes, I realize my posts I mentioned earlier and my comments on them got downvoted to oblivion because it should be something someone at my age should know, but I honestly don't know at all.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1m2aqbo/how_can_i_address_the_feedback_that_i_dont_take/,1752766478.0,Aromatic_Account_698,1m2aqbo,advice_seeking
findapath,systemic burnout,Everything I’m actually interested in doing seems to be considered a “useless” degree and it’s really frustrating and stressful trying to figure out what to do.,"I understand that I really like jobs where the focus is on accuracy and accuracy is more important than speed. I care apparently too much about doing a job correctly and it always sacrifices speed. That used to be fine in retail because the customer always comes first… but lately that’s not really the case anymore if you aren’t working at the speed of a mindless super robot why even schedule you. What do you mean the customers slowed you down and you had no control over how many of them asked you questions? Tough you should have just pulled more time out of thin air. 

I’m getting extremely exhausted of this burnout inducing emphasis on impossible speed standards and really just want something where I can be proud I’m doing my work accurately and not feeling forced to cut corners at every turn for speed. To be honest I’ve never been a “fast person” I don’t know what it is about my brain or body but even at my most fit I’ve never been a fast mover. 

I just really want a job that is 40 hours a week no more no less and focused on accuracy over speed. Where being good at it matters more than being the fastest at it. I’m not looking to be financially rich just stable and not stressed out for the rest of my life. I think I’d LOVE a lab job to be honest even if it was “grunt lab work” but that’s hard to do with only retail experience. 

 I know that my interests tend to lean towards art and science especially any sort of biological sciences and some chemistry sciences also interest me. I’m not super good at math though is my main problem on the sciences front and I also have to rule out art things because it’s just… not realistic to get employed doing that these days unless you are REALLY GOOD. 

I know that the things I’m most interested in are food science and environmental sciences especially stuff involving water and soil quality and like making sure we can grow food and the concepts of plant hybridization and breeding fascinates me. I did science fair projects in school about ways to clean water. This is 100% something I could see myself doing with my life if I’m being completely honest so if I know that why am I here you ask? Well my question is… is this even realistic? My current job has a program where they will pay for schooling with certain degrees and there’s an environmental science one where I can choose a focus on: aquatic biology, applied ecology, sustainability, environmental agriculture, earth systems, environmental water resources, or chemistry in the environment. 

The question I have is… Will I even be able to do anything with any of these degrees? Will I actually be able to get out of retail and do something more enjoyable to me or am I going to be wasting 4 years trying to do any of these degrees? Is it worth it to try since it’s paid for and I don’t have to pay? Or is the time sink still not worth it based on the “uselessness” of all environmental science degrees according to other people in my life. What would you do? Would you do one of these or would you keep searching to figure something else out? 

Also open to any ideas anyone has based on my interests and desires for a job. ",24,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1khpba9/everything_im_actually_interested_in_doing_seems/,1746708649.0,Daisy_Vibes,1khpba9,advice_seeking
findapath,systemic burnout,Need to find sum before the end of summer,"Hi there! I've never posted on here but I'm desperate.

Little context: Picture this I'm a 15 year old in the French academic system, i want to drop out as soon as I can (in my case stop after middle school) but I am heavily advised by my family and dad particularly to continue my studies until end of high school (in other terms get my baccalauréat/Alevels). I get accepted into an international section out of pure miracle (a 4/20 average and a great sense of humor apparently) which I never wanted to go to in the first place, I meet lovely people and the first year is good, we write small stories and analyze a book. The second year was the start of the end, we have 4 books to read, 17 poems to learn by heart along with every other French exams, in short terms I know I won't make it. Everyone wants me to try and so l do, when I arrive in the third year I told my counselor at the time that I wanted to leave the section at least to enter a normal high school class, she informs me that that is not possible as I signed the papers that enrolled me for my end of the year exam. I passed said exams in the last 2 months and just learned that I failed, which I knew I would, I didn't put in the work as I was burnout, always hated school and wasn't even doing something I liked, if it wasn't for my friend I would've dropped out earlier. (My dad is pissed at me for that)

This leaves me, now 18, with no qualification higher than end of middle school diploma (brevet), a C2 English level, a deep hatred for the French education system and absolutely no university for next year (which I didn't want to go to, so it's fine.)

Where I need help is, the only job I ever had was make wraps, burgers and waffles in a water park for 3 weekends, | learned literature for 3 years for nothing, I love arts and I want to leave France, the problem is, my family is already quite financially unstable and as I have just failed my exam my dad will not support me any more in any financial way.

I came on here to ask, and I really hate to do that, if you could give me any tips, any advice, a job offer, anything that could help me first leave home and become independent and second make the 3 years reading Shakespeare and over analyzing Derek Walcott's poetry worth it.

findapath,systemic burnout,"Been a year after graduating, but want to switch careers. Am I jumping ship too early?","Hello everyone,

I graduated last year with a BS in Computer Information Systems. I'm 23 turning 24 and it's been a little bit over a year already and I'm thinking of just going back to school to study to become a RDN. The job market is tough for tech majors, ever since the boom for COVID. I've done a lot in college as to having completed an internship with a F500, worked at the university IT dept , volunteered (although briefly) at a cyber sec org through one of my professors. I've done so much and am still doing so, but the constant applying, interviewing, and rejection, whereas the factors of other tech majors competing, offshoring, company layoffs, and AI have just burned me out of the field in total. Only work I can get off is contract, if I'm lucky enough. I'm in a relationship and I want to provide for my partner, or at the very least, contribute my end. 

Final semester of college, I went to see the dietitian they had at the student medical center, and from there I was highly interested. That was last summer. From there till now, I was working some job and just completed a contract one. I was thinking back again to that Dietitian field, and a huge part of me wants to do it and aim for it. Since then, I've been talking to those in the field, volunteering at Food Banks, and taking prereq classes.

Problem is, I just don't know if I'm rushing into another path because of my burnout and fears. I want to find my path, and I believe this is it, but how do I truly know this is what I want? When I was in the early years of university, I said and did the same thing, but then as time went on, I kept feeling more and more unsure about what I was saying. I don't know if this will be the same. All I want is to make sure I can provide and support for myself and my partner.

Any insight would be appreciated.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1lwteis/been_a_year_after_graduating_but_want_to_switch/,1752195092.0,Kiwi_1127,1lwteis,advice_seeking
findapath,systemic burnout,What are graphic design/ creative jobs that are more artistic and less commercial? and has decent pay and good worklife balance for those with chronic pain/ tension and illness? im burnout,"I recently graduated with a degree in graphic design, but I’m realizing most jobs are highly commercial—focused on marketing, profit, and long screen time, which worsens my chronic pain. I also have, IBS, fatigue, crohns but recently in remission, lot of other somatic and immune system symptoms)  
  
Graphic design is not what I expected. I chose this path thinking I would have a lot of creative freedom like the projects I do in university and because I liked illustration. But now I feel disconnected from the work. It feels more about selling for profit and admin work than creating meaningfully.

I’m still passionate about creative work, but I want something more expressive, artistic, and hands-on—less profit-driven and screen-heavy. I’m drawn to roles like:

* Set/production design
* Film and concept art
* Book cover or children’s book illustration
* Experiential/exhibition design
* Interior design
* Artisan crafts or even food/pastry-related creative fields
* psychology/ therapy/ counselling/ art Therapy/ art teaching, workshops, etc . (but prefer not to go back and study 4+ years and masters for this. Is there another way to learn this? for example  people who work to resolve chronic pain can be fitness trainers and don't need to have physio degree ) but still have.lot of relevant and useful knowledge)

I like analog and real-world creation more than digital-only work.

**Questions:**

1. Are there creative jobs where storytelling, expression, and hands-on creation are more valued than marketing?
2. Has anyone transitioned from graphic design into more artistic fields like film, illustration, or interior/set design? What was your journey like?
3. Are there design roles where other teams handle budgets/marketing, while the designer focuses on the craft?
4. Has anyone else overcome burnout from trying to manage anxiety and chronic pain/ tension and illness with career, work. I am so overwhelmed with the amount of bare minimum things I already do and then having to find time/ energy (that I don't have) for upskilling and working on financial goals, business and focus on making a lot of money in order to get out of being trapped in this chronic pain situation that is affecting everything in my life and work performance...

Any personal experiences or insights would really help. Thank you!

Honestly I don't really know what I am doing with my life. All I know is that my problems will be solved and I will be much much happier if I had all my health issues and symptoms resolved. And to do that practically I need to have a lot a lot of money. Meaning in order to be happy and at peace and finally pain free I would need to have a lot of money. How else am I going to afford to rest and heal and have less anxiety knowing the money will run out and not be able to afford treatments and finally feel like I am able to rest in peace with financial stability. Im thinking millions (for my personal achievement goals) so I can have the highest chance to find a solution to my symptoms and afford to keep on finding and trying therapies and modalities.

findapath,systemic burnout,What to do when you don't have the motivation to do what it takes??,"If you feel stuck and unmotivated, you’re not broken. It doesn’t mean you’re lazy or doomed—it means your system needs support.

Motivation is deeply tied to your emotional state—and as you probably already know, emotions fluctuate. You might feel inspired one moment and totally drained the next.

But if your ability to take action depends on motivation, you’re going to hit a wall—because now your power is in the hands of the most unpredictable part of you.

It’s OK to not feel motivated to do the “right” things. In fact, a big part of adulthood is doing what needs to be done *even when* you don’t feel like it. That might sound depressing, but it's actually better for you: once you reach a higher level of emotional and behavioral mastery, **you gain more freedom** to actually do what you want—because the baseline stuff is already being handled. (But that’s another topic.)

So, how do you take action *without* relying on motivation?

**1) Understand & Know Yourself More**

What does this mean?

* **Recognize your strengths and weaknesses.** Most people under-utilize their strengths and over-focus on their weaknesses, which drains momentum and confidence.
* **Know your triggers.** When you understand what pulls you into spirals, you can create a plan to get yourself back on track.
* **Identify your limits—then stretch them.** Knowing your “place” in the bigger picture helps you avoid burnout, boredom, and stagnation. You learn to challenge yourself just enough to grow.
* **Gain higher control over your thoughts & emotions.** Yes - this is possible!

**2) Create a Consistent Daily System**

What does this mean?

* **Plan your day/week/month.** Sticking to the plan—even imperfectly—matters more than whether you feel good enough to do it.
* **Set a clear goalpost/reference point.** Define where you are now and where you want to be. This will help you understand how far away (or how close) you are from what you want and what you need to get there.

**3) Take Action—No Matter How Small**

What does this mean?

* **Let actions lead your emotions.** Motivation comes and goes. But taking action—even tiny ones—can shift your energy faster than waiting to feel ready.
* **Ask: “What can I do** ***right now*** **that gets me closer to my goal?”** Even if it’s 30 seconds long, do it. You’re breaking the pattern of procrastination.

It doesn’t all have to change today. Just take the next small step.

findapath,boss is a bully,"I Won’t Kill Myself, but I Ask God for Cancer","Hey guys - lawyer here. 33, gay male, and Living in NYC. I grew up here also. I was born into a very strict Italian Catholic household and I knew I was gay at a very young age. However, I always kept it secret because my mother put her emotions on me, so I never wanted to disappoint her, and my dad was an alpha male Italian. I was bullied relentlessly in school and retreated into myself. I told myself, “don’t focus on building a social life because the world is cruel, but focus on your professional life and show them you’re capable.” So that is what I did. I stayed in the closet until I was 29 and only have made maybe 2-3 friends in my entire life.

I now have my dream life, living in the city and being a lawyer but I’m not happy. The world around me is the same, cruel place. I thought I was going to find a home within the gay community and what I got was a community of stuck up, conceited, bitches who just want to fuck each other and do drugs. I have no desire to interact, I have no desire to do things. I stay in my house day in and day out and hang out with my gorgeous cat, if it weren’t for her, I feel like I might not be here. The same goes for my late dog Bella who saved me multiple times.

I haven’t been laid in months because I’m disgusted at what I find on dating apps. Because of my 29 years of mental torture trying to fix the gay out of me and all the abuse I simultaneously faced, I now suffer from panic attacks. I avoid most of the few friends I have because I can’t listen to their issues, I take too much of that energy on. It’s like I’m too sympathetic and absorb peoples emotions. If my boss is mad at something, even if it has nothing to do with me, my body starts to sweat my heart races and I begin to freak out until I leave and take a walk to breathe.

I’m growing tired. Day in and day out of waking up just wait to go to sleep at night. I go to work and come home and I don’t leave my house until I go to work the next week. I don’t want to interact with the mean world around me, I don’t have any interest in anyone on any dating apps, I’m disgusted by the gay community, I’ve never belonged anywhere, and I’m tired of constantly fighting a war inside my head. I don’t like to drink, so I don’t want to go to bars, I’m not crazy about doing drugs so I don’t want to be in a loud gross sweaty ass club with blasting music and people rubbing their dicks against me, so what do I do? Where do I go?

BUT I can’t kill myself. I can’t do that to my family. Although my mother has her issues, my brother, sister, father, and especially my cat keep me here. I could NEVER hurt them like that. I’m here solely because of them. So I’m here. Waiting…..going to work, coming home, trying to sleep as much as I can to pass time waiting for my eventual natural death.  I pray a lot for God to give me a child’s cancer who can save the world, who wants to be here and will do great things.  I achieved my dreams already, I know I can do it. I’m tired and ready to go.

It’s nice that other people here have similar stories but has anyone found the key to happiness? Like is there a way of viewing things that has changed your perspective?  I just hope that either I find the right cocktail meds one to get me by, or God grants my wish.",160,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1flte3e/i_wont_kill_myself_but_i_ask_god_for_cancer/,1726887229.0,Leather_Candidate636,1flte3e,advice_seeking
findapath,boss is a bully,"I quit CS/Software Engineering. I want to make impacts, not software. And I need a change.","I definitely did not peak in high school. I suffered a lot. Everything from racism, depression and initial diagnosis, SI,  and many other things I don't know if I can say to avoid the triggers that people may have and/or break rule number 4. However, I did have so much more of an impact and fulfillment fighting back that happened.  I did activism, organized protests, headed Student Council. And while I had so much pain, I can't help to be amazed at my past self who did everything in his damn power to make a difference for his community - even if the colleges he dreamed could not accept how special he was. I do not yearn for the pain, but that fulfillment I went through. 

Fast forward to college, and while I am happy that I feel much more safer and I can be me - I cannot help but think that my life is quite boring and not fulfilling. I majored in CS and wanted to get into Software Engineering, but after a year of CS and doing an internship I realized it was not for me. I couldn't live with myself if I wasn't making an impact, and here I was positioning my life to revolve around coding - something that should have stayed as a fun hobby than a career. I always had a thing for coding and was good at programming and math, but just because I was good at it' does not mean I should have perused it. 

However, not everything in college was a bore. I enjoyed being a researcher and volunteering, and I not only conduct research at my internship, but I also have a huge passion for societal change as I feed the homeless almost every other day. Thank god I went back to volunteering, because I would have went insane knowing that the best thing to make an impact on the people around me was being a code-monkey. 

To the people of reddit I ask: What major/career should I position to make change just like I did back in high school?  
  
Here are some other things that may narrow down the process:  
  
 I always had a thing about collecting and using data to support claims.  
I've been doing research for what is about to be my third year, and I enjoy it so much. i love the discipline because I am never profiting, just always learning. There is no secret agenda or outcome, I just want to learn. Speaking of profiting-

Hated corporate America and profiting.   
  
So anything business related is not on the table. I always grew up being told I need to become a business person, but seeing how many people around me focusing their lives over the clout of working at a FAANG company or getting money or bossing others around is not my thing at all. Especially entering CS where I met so many people who fit the 'entetrpenur 22 year old tech start-up' sterotype.   
  
Loved leadership, activism, and improving society.   
Again, I did a lot of social activism and Student Council in high school to make the voices of others heard.   


Patching up injustice.   
  
Most of my activism was focused on reform. I did a lot on police reform in the wake of the Flyod murder, and Asian voices being heard after the Georgia Spa shooting. I did mental health activism as I was diagnosed with depression, suffered, and got bullied for it at school. The psychologists at school were crappy to, so I spoke at admin meetings about the need for mental health sustainability. And right now, again, I volunteer at multiple mobile food pantries to feed homeless people around the city. There were many times I cried seeing how much pain I was in or pain the people around me in. I hate the injustice I see, but I 100% enjoy and fulfill putting thoe pathches on society. I want to dive even further into the social good world - I just don't know how.

Please ask me anything in the comments! I would love to hear any advise you guys have about career changes and what I should do with my life. I eventually did change my major to Data Science because I loved statistics, and I have a concentration in urban planning + pubic affairs with minor in public policy. I know that might be where I need to go considering my non-profit, leadership, and social good mind but I am still not sure how and where I fit.

findapath,boss is a bully,"Almost 40, and need your advice","Hi everyone,  
So, im about to turn 40 in 3 days. Life was quite wild, not gonna lie: I come from a war torn country and my childhood was quite rough (bullying, quite a broken family, parents never loved each other, money was tight, relationship with my older brother were violent, and much more). Yet, despite all of the abovementioned, i manage to make something(ish) off of it: I managed to get a European passport, traveled the world quite extensively, fell in love in different language (after being quite unpopular as a child), and had a spiritual quest that took me deeper than i could ever imgained - both inside and outside.  
But there are also some shortcomings obviously, as part of my human experience, but one that disturbs me the most: I havent managed to understand how to make money. Im not talking about making millions or becoming rich, i truly dont care about that. I'm talking about a stable income, maybe something that will allow me to move more freely or at least buying a nice apartment in a warm country in Europe, like Greece. It seems like all my ventures to try and enter a field which might be profitable stumbles upon so many obstacles (mostly financial) that doesnt allow my to finish it or at least make substantial achievments. I tried teaching myself how to code (3 times already!), it went pretty good and i even got accepted into a free coding school, but had to find a way to fund all the rest (rent, bills, food) for a month, but i was too short financially, and lost my thrill. Then i tried to get a grip around crypto, but that didnt work as well, i was too worried about losing even the little i had. I was also offered a trading course (here on Reddit) but that was really giving away all the money i've had.  
I have a degree in Organic Farming, quite an experimental one which i thought would assist me but didn't mount to much. I was working as a laboratory assistant, had some issues with drunk and drug addicted guy that made the job so hard for me - so i decided to quit (spoiler: Nobody cared. A boss that was running his mouth day in day out about how we are all ""family"" didn't even bother to check upon me). I got accepted to another degree to become a paramedic, but i think it is a waste of time.

  
So, why am i telling you all of this, especially in this group? Guys, i need advice. If you could start over, studying something beneficial (especially in the tech field, maybe something that you don't have to be a genius to do yet manageable to teach yourself with lots of dedication and sacrifice) , what would it be? I have about 4300 dollars (4000 euros) for my name, and i can go back home to my mom's place (which is not ideal, to say the least) for this venture.

If you have a decent road map you took in a similar situation, let me know. I'd appreciate every tip or assistance.

I feel extremely exhausted from moving in and out of short term rentals, and although im quite healthy and have 0 addictions, i feel like its my last chance to give 150% and achieve something.   
Also, i know that the internet can be cruel, so spare me the details about how i should have done this and that. Remember: You only see people's decisions, not the opportunities they had infront of them.

Private messages can also help.

p.s - Don't offer any content creating stuff, it's not my world nor of my interest.

**I am essentially a failed 24m loser, neet who dropped out and i see no future.**

  
I tried therapy but it didnt work, multiple times, mental health where i live (Portugal) is a joke and underveloped, tried meds didnt work, i dont see any future for me, i still wanna try to kms again after 3 months because of personal reasons, but thats the plan in 3 months if nothing changes i wanna kms (overdose on sleeping pills to kms peacefully), so what do i do now? i dont have a family, friends, never will have them or a gf, i doubt ill get a fullfiling job, since min wage slavery is hell on earth, i truly believe after a time your life ends, school is bad, but being a wage slave, where its only boomers, and no young people to connect and relate means you will spend ur days just working, working, sleep repeat cycle, to me its no way of living, so what reasons do i have to live? IS IT SO BAD TO DIE? 

  
**I think even if i get what i want, whatever that is, i doubt ill be happy, ill still be suffering because i died long time ago and im just a shell of what i once was, i cant return to nromal life, or normal ways of thinking after everything i know and have bee trough, all that pain and sacrifice, that wasted youth ill never get back, and a life of min wage slavery is gonna be the last thing i want, since ill have no time to game or watch anime, the only things thetering me to this world.**

  
So what do i do, please, please tell me, please advise me, i am so lost, so tired, so jaded, i can't take this anymore, i am at my limit, and if nothing happens, in 3 months ill call it quits for good, i am kinda looking foward to it actually.

  
Now for some very generic questions people ask me and ill reply why i cant do it.

Why not move? **And do what? i went to france once, doing essentially slave labour where the mf didnt pay me, if i go to a place i dont know or speak the langauge ill just work some shitty manual labour job, like i did so many times and i dont want that, america and Uk are also impossible due to needing visas, visas as far as i know only are given, if you have exp in jobs or someone hires u, i meet none of the criteria.**

Why no friends or gf ever? **Because depression, trust issues, jaded, cynical, people hate it, and will promptly remove themselfs in due time, its a pernicious and ubiquitous cycle ive seen time and time again, i need to be ""normal"" for anyone to love me, and i doubt ill be, im too broken after all.**

Are min wage jobs so bad? **Doing something u hate, for the rest of your life, then being discarded like a used c+ndom, and then ure too old, senile and jaded to even enjoy whatever retirement u have? IF, big IF, you even have one.** Not to mention, boomers, getting looked at wierd because u dont like their normie slop (media, tv shows, boring repetitive talk), etc, i am very pleasent and respectfull and dont show this disdain openly tho, so i doubt im the issue, i just really cant connect, and ofc being used and abused by bosses, something very common in Portugal min wage conditions, at least they were the times i did work, and its worse in rural portugal (Where i am).

**If you can find a way to disprove or change my mind on these things ill be forever gratefull, but i know im rigth life for some has allways been bad, there are winners and losers, i guess im the loser huh.**

So what do i like? Maybe i can follow my dreams evetually rigth? I doubt it, its not like i am dumb, i was very very smart and gifted as a kid, i was able to solve math problems when i was younger in seconds, and my peers took 5 to 10 minutes, i grasped shit easy, life was a bore, everything was so easy no matter what i did so i got bored, complacent never tried all trougth my school life, i tanked my grades (specially after divorced parents), i allways loved art, but never managed to partake in it until i was 21, and even then some deep seated trauma prevents me from fully immersing myself in it, its quite hard since i have ADHD and OCD, and past traumas (like abusive parents being against art, not allowing me to follow my dreams and education in it), so i doubt ill be able to work in art, specially since portugal is a bad place for art.

**I wanna created manga/comics of stories, i wanna be an digital illustator but i dont think its possible for the afromentioned things, i am also old now, i doubt ill be able to hone my craft when im a tired, wage slave, cuz if now its hell to do anything, imagine when im working lmao.**



# So yeah, my dreams are shattered, and i doubt ill achieve them, i hate my country, i hate these normie npcs who ruined my life, i will never have friends or conenctions, since i also cant relate to portuguese people, im just diferent than them, if i was american id be allot better off and realize im more americanized due to media and growing up online, i have no future, im too traumatized, mentally ill, jaded and cynical, depressed, no good job prospects and if life is just wage slavery and barely getting by, with no human conection, no fulfiling life, is it so bad to want to die? If i get no answers i guess ill have no choice, this world really is hell, so theres no point, nothingness is a sweet release i have been craving for very long time, i was too much of a coward, but in 3 months, i hope to gather enough courage to do it, and finally end this living nigthmare.

findapath,boss is a bully,"Need help understanding ""life""","\*cross posted\* 

I have no post-secondary education, but I did graduate high school. I’ve spent much of my time working in the trades as a laborer—jobs like trucking, trench digging, and scaffolding as I lived in an area where it was very easy to get hired on. I had undiagnosed bipolar disorder and managed to stay successful at previous jobs until the illness took hold, and I couldn’t show up to work anymore. Now, at 28, I’ve realized I’ve become an easy target for workplace issues I didn’t have to face in my early 20s.

In the past year or so, that usually follows after people find out my age, I’ve dealt with a surge in alienation and bullying from coworkers. At my old job, I let a lot slide. My coworkers orchestrated plans to get me fired or ruin my reputation, starting with accusations of drug use, then targeting my sexuality, and eventually painting me as a danger to the women I worked with. I had no idea why I was being treated this way—I always kept my distance and just tried to do my job, and the more I began to get the cold shoulder the more i became distant and worked my ass off because I thought my performance was the issue.

Come to find, they didn’t like that I had the job without a family or wife at home. It seemed they’d made bad decisions and wanted me to follow suit. Eventually, I got too tired to care about the rumors. Going after the company for the stress they caused wasn’t an option; by the time I figured it out, new management sided with them, and I was dismissed without cause.

At a few new jobs since then, things started decently. But trouble followed. One coworker said something rude, and when I told her to go away, she ran to the boss claiming I swore at her. We sorted it out—me, her, and the boss—and caught her in a lie. She’s on thin ice now. Two weeks into that job, a new guy began spreading rumors about a girl I got along with well, and making snide comments during morning meetings when I offered suggestions. I dragged him, the boss, and the girl aside and completely lost it on him. It stopped, and I got an apology. I hate doing it, but I think it’s the only way to handle “these kinds” of people—those with little education (not past high school) and no real coping skills for stress. They inflict it on others to make their jobs “interesting” or boost their egos. Past coworkers tried dragging me into that mindset, but I refused every time.

I don’t think people target me on purpose; it’s just how they function when they see someone they consider subhuman. I’m worried this will keep happening unless I change my path. My plan is to go to school for a trade—specifically plumbing—to avoid most of these bullshit games and work with better, more well-rounded people. I know every trade, company, and career has this “game” culture—I’m no stranger to “messing with the new guy”—but I hope it’s not as bad as what I’ve experienced. I’m not saying I’m not competitive, but I don’t think it’s worth being ready to go to jail for your money. That’s been the core of my time in the trades and It has given me a distorted view on life.

I’m really hoping to hear that it’s not as rough in other trade environments compared to what I’ve been through.

Sorry for the long read—any input would be fantastic. Thank you!",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1jd0vgr/need_help_understanding_life/,1742173565.0,Zealousideal-Fact376,1jd0vgr,advice_seeking
findapath,boss is a bully,"Be real, is it too late for me? NEET","So im gonna keep it short, im 23, 24 in february, i have been lonely all my life, i suffered from both abusive parents, bullying, depression, suicidal tendencies all my life, that branches into other problems as you can imagine and affects your future, overal i have lost all hope, i have reached a point where i dont trust people, i dont trust the system in my country and i dont trust my jobs, seeing how most of them were awfull manual labour and the bosses dont pay me, or pay me too little, such is the work culture of Portugal.

I have given up on everything and everybody, since for work its such an agonizing experience, and people are evil nonsters who try to bring you down if you show any weakness, i have developed a defeastist mindset where tbh i dont believe ill ever have those things i want, and no matter what i try or do ill allways be miserable, specially since i achieved all my goals of self improvement and my life is still miserable, i am gonna kms next year guaranteed if this keeps up, since i usted to be a neet all my life, bad looking, couldnt speak to people, awkward, now im in college and changed all those aspects but life is still painfull.

What the hell do i do now? Due to me being the most depressed, jaded and burned out, people took advantage of that and ruined my chances at college, so now ill have to drop out this year, the only reason im still gonna do one more year, is for the money i get from scholarship, wich isnt much, but enough to no worry about rent, or being a wage slave, otherwise id have quit by now, the reason im gonna quit is complicated, but in short people brougth me down, bullied and ostracized and excluded me, they ran smear campaigns and overall made my life hell, so now im lonely, more than ever, and since its a small school these evil people have contaminated the rest of the people so the interactions make it impossible to continue my life here and pursue a career im unsure i want, or has any future.

This means that i have no idea what i can do, i dont wanna be a wage slave since the working conditions are awfull, i have no talent or skill, so i cant work on something i actually enjoy like art, so im gonna be cursed with manual labour.

I dont believe i can make friends, its too late since im 23 and the fact that as an adult i will spend 70% of my time working means, that experiencing my youth and make friends and go on adventures or have inocent, no strings friendships or Gf is impossible, i will never have friends since im so jaded, cynical, depressed and bitter and resentfull, what do i do? Its over for me isnt it? I tried to change my life, i acomplished everything i set out to do, and yet people still ruined my life.

I cant continue college, since this has been the most awfull, and painfull experience ive ever gone trough and i wanna leave this place asap, i have no family, because my family is shit and they all hate each other.

I have nothing. 

Not even hope that things will get better, should i just do it?

I doubt that things will get better, and after the Hérculean effoet i spent trying to improve my life, i dont have that fire in me anymore, im dead inside, i died long time ago, i dont know who i am, what i want anymore, i just wanna die.

Is there hope? How do i change my life once again?

I cant get a therapist since no money, and mental health here is a joke, i was thinking of moving country, but i have my pc here, my only beloved thing in this world, and even if i do move i dont think ill ever trust people leading to isolation once again, and the cost of living is worse in other countries so ill probs become a wage slave again, i wanted to move to american, but at this point idk wich place id like to go to, i dont know how to go there, what papers i need, how to convert currency, etc, im just so uncertain and lost. Too many things that seem impossible and hard at my age, i mean i once went to France once and since i dont speak the language i ended up working hard manual labour and i dont want that ever again, specially since i wasnt even paid for it, boss took advantage of me.

Seems like moving is the only optioni have now, but even then i doubt things would change, and idk where to go since i dont wanna go to a non english country and do manual labour for the rest of my life, and go to america or UK and become miserable wage slave. I also dont know how to look up papers, Visa, how to move there, how to rent a room to live, im useless, how to get a job, etc etc.

What the hell do i do now, i have lost everything, i have nothing, it feels like its too late to pursue any of my dreams now, and even if i do pursue them, i have no energy or desire, i just wanna die now.

Ppl keep telling me itll be okay or that it will work out, i think its a lie, ive tried everything, and yet i have nothing, i wish someone would just tell me its ok to give up to tell me it wont work out, to be honest and blunt about my situation.

So ig my options rn are, move country or kms.",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1f1p4kl/be_real_is_it_too_late_for_me_neet/,1724681348.0,Firm-Sink-5054,1f1p4kl,advice_seeking
findapath,boss is a bully,How do I go forward in this work environment? ,"
I am newer at my company. Although I am new to company, I have been in my profession for 7 years and I love my field of work (I’m in banking)! When I was hired, I was offered my role by the executive team and I came into company at a mid level position. Everything was fantastic with new job… until I met my direct manager at my office. My manager (let’s call her Kim) is also newer at my company, only coming in a few months before me. Within my first week at the office, Kim comes in my office and closes the door and gives the “I’m your boss and everything goes through me” speech. She even went on to say that the executive team that hired me is irrelevant to how she runs her office. And I get it - you’re the manager and maybe she was feeling out my work ethic or attitude. So I’m like yes ma’am, happy to be here! Well I quickly learn that Kim is a little bit of a bully and will at any chance tell you how busy she is and all the important people she knows - I’m talking heavy name dropping (president of company and board members). I also start to gather that Kim may have been hired for a more marketing/business development role as the company is establishing a presence in new zip code. She wasn’t hired for knowing how to operationally run the office on the day to day - she actually has said on many occasions she doesn’t know how to use our systems or our lending policies… I promise this info is relevant lol. About two months after starting, our executive team comes to our office and meets with me. They offer me a job as the assistant manager which I gladly accepted! But I quickly learn, my manager was not in the loop or even told that I was going to be offered this role. And she is mad. I obviously thought she was involved in this but she found out when I did. My new job duties outline that I am now responsible for the operations of the office and will assist the manager with scheduling and day to day functions. And Kim’s role has shifted to her being out of office a lot more doing business development. Kim is back in my office saying this is how it’s going to work around here, I’m the boss and everything goes through me still and she looks over my job duties and starts checking them off like a list saying “you’re not doing that” “nope that’s my job”. I even hear Kim talking to another employee and she is telling them that everything goes through her still and my position doesn’t mean anything to her or her team. My feelings are obviously hurt and I feel like I’m just in the middle of a mess! I have tried to speak to Kim about my job duties and I told her I don’t want my position to just be a title, that I want to perform my duties so she can perform hers. But she isn’t letting me take over anything. We are in the process of hiring a new employee and Kim told me that I will not be involved at all with this process and I will not sit in the interview she is going to do and I’ll meet who ever is hired with the rest of the team. I told her I obviously respect her decision but I would really like to be apart of this process since this employee will be working in the office daily on our system and loans (which I’m now responsible for ensuring is correct). Any advice is appreciated!! I want to maintain a working relationship with Kim so our office flows well but I don’t know how many times I can have the same convo with her.. and potentially have a poor review in the future because I can’t fully do my duties.

findapath,boss is a bully,I moved to a new place for a new Job now I‘m completely lonely and looking for my Purpose,"Hello guys,
I‘m a 24 year old guy and I have achieved nothing in my life. On the internet u always hear about people who in their young years either had fun and achieved nothing or who worked hard and are striving for a better life. 

I met the perfect life of both: working hard, having no fun and still achieved nothing. I had my fair share of gfs - 6 in total, 5 since I turned 18 and got my last girl over a year pregnant but the baby died. Since a year now I‘m sexless and lonely. I got a new Job in a tech field on the other side of the country and moved 500km away from home. I liked the job and colleagues but my boss was an a*hole and I got fired (got also bullied there because of my Balkan ancestry).

Now I‘m stuck in this place and this soulless flat where I know absoloutely nobody. I‘m in eastern Germany now and unlike in the western German town I grew up, there is absoloutely none of my people (Albanians) here just Germans and it‘s absoloutely boring.

When I‘m on the internet I always hear people talk about how if u lonely just go out and search for hobbies and I have some in mind like Firefighting or doing martial arts. But the thing is I will leave this place in March next year for either Vienna or Würzburg (the cities in which I have lots of contacts due to living there) to go to college there. So I don‘t know if it‘s worth it trying these hobbies now, cause If I met people there I know that I will leave them and it gets me nothing at all. I will only stay here cause the contract for my appartment is until March. Got a Job cleaning toilets which is very good paid but of course „a shit job“ in the meantime so I can save up some money.

I‘m incredibly lonely, i just want to one time have that feeling of chilling in a college, learning and working to something, living with multiple people in an appartment house and have fun, but I don‘t know at all what career to pursue. If I should become teacher, lawyer, doctor or just study pharmacy. I don‘t know my purpose and what to do the whole day. Obly thing I do all day is work (it‘s just 4 hours) train in home gym, smoke cigarettes and numb myself with music.",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1gi474h/i_moved_to_a_new_place_for_a_new_job_now_im/,1730575457.0,Jeko63,1gi474h,advice_seeking
findapath,boss is a bully,What should I do? ," I have College diploma in CS but never work in IT line before. I straight away took after graduate account job because it was higher pay and it is convenient for me. 

I have transport at that time. After I graduated bad luck COVID strike and lock down 1 year. Wasted. 

So far I work in accounts for 2 year + turning 30 next year. I feel like it's ok but it's tedious and boring. I am to a point where tbh fed up of the job. I can do the job no problem. But I don't feel it you know. There's no motivation. It's always the same thing on repeat. If I want to start back to IT my pay would be significant reduce , not only that I would need to work my way up again. 

Now in accounts imo the pay is ok. Not that high but ok. I have no cert. And if I want to get the cert I feel like it's kind of waste of money. And my CS cert gonna burn. 

Now if I reflect back . I at school I am not a good programmer. I excel some of the course like websites stuff , design UI/UX , even Photoshop. 

But when comes to java , VB.net , JavaScript . Yeah I kind of suck I just don't understand the logic to be honest I pick up very slow . Like it just can't click I don't understand why. And tbh I don't think I would be a good fit too. 

Now the biggest dilemma. If I reflect back in my whole life. The thing I enjoy while doing and actually make me happy when doing . It's baking , cooking. 

I thought it's just a hobby and just forget about it and just simply study the diploma after graduate high school. I am from south east Asia btw. 

So to sum it up. I can say I am good at cooking , baking. And I love it. But I feel like it cannot be turned into a Career and if I want to start I am stuck. And I feel like I am too old already. 

But I am single , male , no girlfriend. Like how do people even find what they are good at and do. I feel like I am stuck. 

My reason here because my whole life it's just rough. I lost my dad when I was 7 and lost of sister at the age 21. Both first week of school. 

I also been though health problems etc. I am always worried , I also been bullied in school , been backstab by friends , and now even at work co workers and boss bullies me. I stand up to them . But they are owner of the company , and the one co-workers are the boss Favourite. Favioutism. 
Through the years I slowly overcome my grief of losing my love one and slowly overcome my traumatic experience of getting sick.  I did the endoscopy 5 times that 1 year . Meet bad doctor. Worst is 3 time during the scope I woke up in the middle of it. So yeah. I got trauma. 

Now I need to face the boss and coworker. The boss keep nitpick , and keep finding fault with me. I did my job fast and efficiently I got scold , and even how I do my job she also wants to be involved. Me working for her 2 year + I only received criticism , while other coworker her fav , receive praises , and even if do wrong she also nvm.  If I did wrong she hunt me down and lectures me for 4 hours. Question my work integrity etc. 

When my family admitted to hospital. I need to stay overnight . I already inform her. The next day she forgot. And she got crazy and keep on miss call me. And ask me to call her back. And I did. When she pick up the phone she ask me where am I . I told her I was at hospital. She say is it really that critical? Is your family stable? If so pls come back to work in the morning and go back to the hospital at night. 

And fyi. The hospital and my work place per trip 2 hours. 

I work 8.30am to 5.30pm. not to mention jam etc. that's gonna 4 hours in total if no jam. And this is just the first night. I already explained to her I need to stay I have nobody left. I am all that left. I need to be with my family to take of her. The crazy ladyboss insist that I go back to work. 

And fyi. The job the department already got people. That can handle the job. So the boss is like asking so many questions pretending to care . But she doesn't even give a damn. She just want me go back to work. Not only that you guys know taking care of your family or love one in hospital overnight , it's restless night etc. 
It's just draining. Imo the accounts job is good. But within these 2 years I only received insults from the ladyboss no matter how I do it's just critism. I just hold on and give in.

Tbh at this point I am thinking of quitting my job but if I jump ship I do not know weather I should go back to my IT or go accounts job if I go I need certificate or should I just go learn baking , cooking etc. And open my own shop and I know it's super risky. But I do hate dealing with people. All my live I always meet like 90% bad people. 10% good. 

The good one aren't also that good also but they are decent imo. I do not like dealing with people. 

Also to note it's been a long time since I updated my programming skills. But I still remember what I learned. So yeah. ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1g6k3e5/what_should_i_do/,1729263578.0,musiclover1c,1g6k3e5,advice_seeking
findapath,boss is a bully,Ongoing career frustration: Will it ever end?,"Am I just doomed to be miserable at work for the rest of my life? 

I've been asking myself this for years. After recently turning 40 I'm wondering if there's just no hope for me. 

I've spent most of my career in the nonprofit sector. I still care about the work I do in many respects (particularly the clients), but my heart just isn't in it anymore. 

I'm tired of being broke all the time. I'm tired of my unusually high number of abusive bosses. I'm tired of all the secondary trauma. I'm just tired. 

Every weekend is just recovery from the stress of work. I find myself unable to enjoy the time I spend with my family on my days off because I can't stop thinking about how I have to go back to my job again on Monday. It's gotten to the point that I feel physically ill pretty much all the time.

Perhaps the worst part of all of this is that over the past year or so I have actually made a ton of progress in therapy, and I think I finally found meds that work for my anxiety and depression. But the day to day slog of my work really tests the limits of these interventions. 

My therapist is convinced I'm experiencing severe burnout, and I'm inclined to agree. Some things have happened at work recently that have all but killed my ability to hope for a better work life for myself. My now ex-boss spent months trying to fire me (they were unsuccessful but thankfully HR intervened because I was really just being being bullied), and we have had an uptick in really heartbreaking client cases with no real solutions. I cry in my car at least once a week. 

I've tried reaching out for career transition help, but I don't even know what I'd do. I thought about going back into academia, which is probably a better fit than social services, but I can't afford to take such a massive paycut  at this point in my life. 

I'm just lost and I feel like this is just how my life will always be. 

How do I move on from all of this? Is it even possible?

Sorry, this is kind of a rant. I'm just so incredibly miserable and I don't want to be this way.

findapath,surviving my job,Is there hope for us who are in our 20s?,"I know i'm not alone in this. I have seen now tons of people in their 20s with the same problem, related to education, the job market and financial burden.

Feels like the average person is broke now. Talking about paycheck to paycheck. The work culture if you can even call it that anymore, has transformed into something different, something monstrous. It used to be working two jobs meant you were hustling, making things happen, but now it's just for survival. It's a sign of necessity.

Somehow this became normal. Cost of living shot past wages like a train, everyone is hoping that they won't collapse. It used to be that if you can't afford living in the city you could move out, but even those are expensive. If you can find a house you can afford, good luck finding a job that can pay for it. People say wages has gone up, well yeah against what? Sandwiches that cost twice as much as they did before?

Feels like the middle class is gone, vaporized, that we only have the wealthy and the rest. More people are taking debt just to go forward. It's not just inflation. It's the cost of everything they don't talk about. Housing? A joke. Renting? You need two jobs and a prayer. Owning a home? That's reserved for people with six-figure incomes or rich parents. Even if you manage to scrape together a down payment, you are still looking at skyrocketing fees and taxes that makes you wonder if homelessness is the cheaper option.

If you think of education as a way out of this then good luck. College costs like a house and student loans never go away from all the people i have heard. I personally don't have any debt by getting a degree but i feel for those who do. And my degree used to be something useful when getting a job, but now it means nothing.

Im not lazy, i have applied for countless jobs. Granted, i'm 24 years old. But when will i ever be able to move out with starvation wages? I have applied for jobs related to my degree but nothing. The machines took the jobs and the people got left behind. We used to believe that robots and AI would make our life easy and make us enjoy life. But tons of people are facing layoffs now. People are getting miserable. The system is not made to lift people up, only to squeeze all of our energy until there is nothing left.

Then there is healthcare. Try getting sick and see what happens. One emergency room can send you back a year. Break a bone or undergo surgery, or even if you just have the audacity to age it's gonna cost a lot. Don't expect insurance to save you, it's just legalized gambling and they always win.

Then there is the fear we have. The feeling that something is coming but not sure what. Everyone feels the tension but nobody is says it out loud. Maybe it's an economic collapse, maybe it's war, it's uknown. But the tension is there.

However, grad school admissions are looking pretty grim due to funding cuts and my boss told me that there is no way I'm getting into a program this year, and it looks like we might be on shaky financial ground. Getting a PhD in another country isn't really an option, as my long term partner and I live here in SoCal, plus I have family here. I'm just not sure what I can do career wise/what I should pivot to. I have an interview on Monday for an inside sales position at a prominent biotech, but I'm not sure about the long term stability of a job like that. I could switch to healthcare, and try to get into PA school, but I don't want to make even less than I do currently while accruing PCE hours. I can barely afford to survive as is.

findapath,surviving my job,i feel like i have hit a dead end (31f) is this all life is?,"
adulthood has been all about survival for me. i moved out of my abusive home and got a factory job at 19, have bounced from one place to the next ever since for little one dollar raises here and there, landed at my current job for the last 6-7 years. i have tried college off and on throughout the years but the best i have been able to get out of it is an associate's degree that's not specialized.

currently 31 and working at a distribution center moving boxes making like $18 an hour. there's no upward mobility at the job and i already topped out in pay. i don't want to be a supervisor or manager. i don't like being in charge of things or having to babysit people and answer their questions (just being honest). i do feel sorta interested in maintenance work, though? i am good at fixing things and mentally taking things apart, and working alone is my jam, plus i do a lot of random maintenance at work that i am... not paid for... already. unfortunately i have no way of going to college for it (wasted my one opportunity at cheap college in my 20s to get an associate's of arts - intended to become a bachelor of social work before i fumbled all of that) so i don't know how to get into that kind of work. also, i am a woman in a rural area, and it's really hard to be taken seriously in the trades (in my experience) so i'm not sure it's even worth it.

before i got stuck in my crappy job, i used to enjoy writing and editing written stuff. i was really good at it then and originally wanted to get my English degree and do something with that. again, though, i don't have a degree or a way to pay for one so i can't do anything with those skills or that interest in a way that makes money. i can't afford to hope freelancing works out or make a business myself. haven't really bothered with it in years because it's gotten hard to see the point in things that don't make money, so now i'm like, would that even work? also i know ai has pretty much taken over the editing and writing space so it's probably not a good field. 

idk if it comes across as i write, but i feel totally trapped in my life and like it's too late to make any changes. like all i can do now is try to keep cutting expenses so i can keep living on my dwindling wage. i started this job like 6 years ago and have only had my pay increase $3 an hour in that time. it feels so degrading to keep going in there, or into any job anymore, when they are telling me to my face how worthless i am. most jobs around me start at less than what i make now so there's no point in leaving. i am trapped in this stupid hamster wheel. i spiral often in anger at my younger self for making such bad choices, like that's the only thing left to do now that it's all messed up. i hate it. 

fwiw i have a therapist (poor woman has been trying to fix me for like 8 years lol) and i am medicated and diagnosed with adhd and cptsd. i have legit limitations that complicate my ability to succeed and idk i feel like life just isn't really for me at this point? i don't fit anywhere. i don't have a family or any support system really so i feel more like a ghost than a person sometimes. like my existence is a waste on resources, and maybe that's why i can't find a job i like or a place i belong. i intended to end my life when i was like 17 so it's been a trip still being here in my 30s. idk if anyone relates to that. 

just having a rough thought about my life tonight. idk what to do anymore. i need more money desperately so i can maybe relax a little and feel safe but there isn't any money out there if you don't have a degree, is there? am i thinking about things clearly or am i just kind of having a crisis about my place in life?",144,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1hquokc/i_feel_like_i_have_hit_a_dead_end_31f_is_this_all/,1735702020.0,existjaded,1hquokc,advice_seeking

I hate what it's doing to my body, I hate what it does to my mindset and my psychology, I hate coming home and being exhausted and wiped out. 

I hate working with assholes, I hate working with open bigots, racists, and fascist. I hate the fake ass workaholic guilt tripping. 

I hate trying to schedule everything on the weekend cuz I'm too tired to do it during the work week,...and then cramming my weekend full so that my weekend is not relaxing at all. 

I hate having no energy and not being able to be emotionally available to my partner because im so exhausted and overwhelmed. 

when I was a teen, I wanted to do computer science and I wanted to become a software engineer. my grades were not great in high school because I was undiagnosed ADHD, my parents forced me to get a job in in trades, which I stayed doing because the pay was better than nothing. 

now that I see the way the market for Tech is, I'm actually really glad I didn't get into it. 

and now im over it. trades are a meme. 
they always say you're going to make good money in trades, but you won't unless you are basically never home, working ungodly amounts of overtime or working some sort of job where you're gone for a month or more. 

I want to get into something where I feel like I can be myself, or I can be genuine.  I want to get into something where I don't have to act like I'm some rough and tough guy in order survive and not get picked on. 

I ultimately want to help people, I see so many vulnerable and struggling people who everyone else has given up on and condemned. 

I see so many people like my wife who grew up in bad situations because the mental health and addictions, and I want to help these people. 

part of me thinks that if I was on welfare I would be spending a lot of time volunteering at food banks and homeless shelters.

part of me wants to go back to school to become a social worker or something similar, unfortunately it seems like all of the classes I can do in my area are all wait listed for the next year..... 

the more I look into social work, the more I think it is the type of thing I am looking for.

I don't really have the high school education because I struggle with high school so much and didn't pay attention and have terrible grades and missing credits.

findapath,surviving my job,Is voluntary homelessness a good idea,"18M, honestly this might come off as lazy but I have no desire to get a job or career. I don’t want a family, don’t care about material items like cars or clothes. I have always been a minimalist, very introverted and never desired talking to people. My parents and some of my friends question if I’m depressed or something, but I’m not. My hobbies, (reading, being outside, lifting) keep me happy and focused. My goal in life is to become as smart and strong as possible. My parents have been begging me to get a job lately and they basically forced me to go to CC and later transfer to a 4 year. All this has made me consider calling it quits after my two free years of CC and choosing a vagabond lifestyle. My city is very safe and clean, there is a library nearby where I can read. I just feel like I have different aspirations than everyone else and I don’t want a boring life where I work until retirement. Please give any advice if you have lived on the streets or know anybody who has. I come from a middle class background so I know it sounds privileged to want to choose homelessness, but it honestly sounds better than being burdened for the rest of my life with shit I don’t care about nor will make me progress as a person.

In all my accounting classes I passed only by cheating and I never studied so now I don’t know jack about the degree I’m graduating with. But the thing that pains me the most is that I didn’t socialize with others and make friends. I didn’t join any clubs, I just locked myself in my room all 4yrs cuz i couldn’t overcome my mental illnesses (bpd, ocd, adhd, social anxiety…💀L genes ik at least ill be doing the world a favor by never reproducing). 

College is supposed to be a time where you learn about and find yourself, grow immensely, make lifelong friends, and have fun. And I just threw this once in a lifetime experience out the window. Also I was the shy quiet kid my entire life since elementary school and I’ve been going years without any socialization so my social skills are SO COOKED. There are 5yr old kids with better social skills than me. This makes me so depressed cuz it feels like my social skills are cooked beyond saving :/ I always notice how much quicker my peers are at thinking than me, both academically and socially. It’s the sad truth that they worked hard and developed their brain while I brain rotted for 8 years. 

I just feel like the stupidest person alive. Idk how I’ll survive the workforce like this. Even sadder is idk if I’ll ever make close friends :( 

Anyway, I don’t even know if I could survive a corporate job because of my AWFUL social skills, mental slowness, and neuroticism.

findapath,don't know what to do with my life,My parents hired an expensive career coach for me and this is everything that he made me do,"Been lurking here for a while, but finally feeling better about life and figured I'd share my experience..

Honestly, I spent a lot of time the last few years being in a really dark place and feeling pretty lost. I have a lot of chronic health issues and work for me stuck in a job that was awful, not knowing what direction to take, watching everyone else seem to have their shit together while I was just barely existing.

Im grateful my parents basically threw money at me and hired a ""top tier"" career coach for me. Have been working with him for 3 months now and thought I'd dump everything we did you don't have to spend (waste?) the money.

# Month 1 - Tests

First he made me take a bunch of tests. SO MANY tests.

Started with the Clifton Strengths Finder which was interesting but also kind of confusing. It became a lot more valuable with him helping me interpret it as it maps you to 34 ""strengths"" but doesn't necessarily tell you what to with them. Gives you a lot of you are strong at ""maximizing"" but I really needed need to sit down and digest it.

Then he made me take the Highlands Ability Battery. This one cost $400 and took three hours of clicking boxes and memorizing stuff. Was it better than Clifton Strs? Yes, marginally in that it was way more well-rounded but also found it pretty hard to apply. And not $400 better though. It kind of felt taking the SATs again except I paid to do it this time.

Last he made me take the career discovery assessment by Pigment which I actually really liked. He said this one was newer and it definitely felt that way. It was easy to interpret, clear and pretty robust - gave me strengths, career paths, and communication/decision making style advice that wasn’t perfect (and a bit less useful if not knowledge work) but was thought provoking. I think I liked this one the best.

His whole thing with these tests was you can't build a career on weaknesses. Kept saying we needed to identify my natural talents and tendencies first, then find environments where they'd be valued instead of trying to force myself into roles that don't fit. Makes sense, I guess.

# Month 2 - Reflection

Then made me read the book Designing Your Life. THIS was actually solid. Makes you map out different possible life paths, do these ""odyssey plans"" where you imagine 3 totally different versions of your future, and create mini-experiments to test career ideas before committing.

Then the first like daily exercise he had me do was the “Energy Journal” (its part of Designing your Life) - For 2 weeks I had to write down like everything I did and rated it on a scale of -2 to +2 for energy. I thought it was pointless at first but turned out to be eye-opening. Found out I actually get energy from teaching people stuff (which I never realized) and that every time I have to deal with bureaucratic paperwork I want to crawl under my desk. I guess not surprising but nice to measure how much energy I got from the days I was in nature vs staring at screens. Made me realize why my old office job was draining me - it was ALL energy-depleting activities.

Next came the Job history deep dive. We went through every job I've ever had (even that summer restaurant job) and had to write what I enjoyed, what drained me, what I was good at, and what skills I developed. Took forever but patterns emerged. I realized I always thrived when I had autonomy and could solve problems my own way, but struggled when micromanaged (obv). Also saw that I consistently took jobs for the money even when they had red flags matching things I hated from previous jobs. Was kind of a wake-up call realizing I'd been repeating the same patterns for many years.

His big thing during this phase was ""the data is already there in your history."" He kept saying I needed to trust my own patterns and preferences instead of what I thought I ""should"" want.

# Phase 3: Exploring/Testing

Once we had all this data about me, we moved into what he called the ""testing phase.""

First was a Mind Mapping exercise - had to draw this big spider diagram of everything I care about, am good at, what the world needs, and what pays well. Then find the overlaps. It was messy but revealed some options I hadn't considered. Found this sweet spot where my tech background, interest in mental health, and desire to work remotely all overlapped.

Then came The Three Odysseys - from the book, had to map out 3 completely different 5-year plans assuming money/education weren't obstacles. First was continuing my current path, second was the practical alternative (teaching), third was the wild dream (opening a wilderness therapy program). Had to detail what life would look like, challenges, resources needed. Then rate each for resources, confidence, and how much I liked it. The wild dream scored highest on ""liking"" but lowest on confidence. Made me realize I was avoiding the path I actually wanted because I was afraid of failing.

Last part was the Informational Interviews - this one was awkward at first but actually useful. Had to reach out to people in fields I was interested in and just...try talk to them. Started with friends of friends then branched out to cold LinkedIn messages. Asked them what their day-to-day was like, how they got started, what they'd do differently. Did about 7 of these and saved myself from pursuing at least 2 paths that seemed great on paper but would've made me miserable in reality. One guy was super candid about how much office politics played into his ""dream job"" and I realized it wasn't for me.

His philosophy here was ""don't trust your imagination, test reality."" Said most people make career decisions based on assumptions that fall apart once they talk to people actually doing the job.

# End Results

After all this, I’m still not fully sure what I’m doing in life but I feel closer more equipped to be confident in the decision when I am ready.

The career coach is was a nice way to get me to commit to doing all of these things, but the real value was just having structure and someone to call me out on my bs. I think almost all of this stuff you could DIY if you're disciplined.

We’re moving on to interview prep and resume stuff next so maybe I’ll update if there’s anything useful there.

**TL;DR:** I think that if you read Designing Your Life, did the exercises in it, and maybe take the pigment career discovery assessment , and maybe reaching out to some people in fields you’re exploring and you'd probably get 80% of what my parents spent thousands of dollars doing.",6995,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1jb53fz/my_parents_hired_an_expensive_career_coach_for_me/,1741962248.0,Stug1987,1jb53fz,advice_seeking

I am lost in life. I lost the only friend I had and now I have none. I am currently going through a life crisis on top of that to where I regret not making friends, socializing, and not going out much in my 20s(or whole life basically). I am insecure and anti-social. I've never had a girlfriend before and have been constantly rejected. I've spent my entire life doing nothing but playing video games and working the same job I've worked for years.

These classes aren't fun for me to learn, so I ChatGPT my way through them. I keep telling myself that if I don't actually take the time to learn this stuff, having this degree would be meaningless because I wouldn't have the necessary skills to land jobs. But as I study for my classes I have no interest in, I continuously chip away my 20s with no friends, and having fun in life. I have felt this way for a long time and I am depressed.

You guys have shown plenty of love, however, despite all of this, I unfortunately will continue to live on my life miserably with little to no change of plans as I see no other way out. I recently went back to school, hoping to connect with people like me but didn't have any luck. The only job I currently have that I worked at for years also isn't helping due to the fact that the only person that I ever felt a connection with rejected me and left me. My memory of her still haunts me every time I go to work. There was also a new crush I had there shortly after, but that didn't go too well either. I will admit that I am not a very good-looking guy, and the black pill has definitely done a number on me, but I digress. I know this post is old and I doubt anybody will read this, but I just wanted to leave a quick update and gratitude for the support you guys tried to give me.

in september 2022 i choose to try college, i failed my first year but i was carefree (maybe a bit too much), my friends and i repeat a year and everything was alright, so it didn’t affected me that much.

but the reality now is, i am 24, 25 in less than 10 months, still at my moms, facing my college year results. i feel defeated, i didn’t even cry, i just stared at it, feeling empty. i have put so much effort and hard work and again i didn’t passed. while my best friend did passed. 

at 24 i feel like my life is stuck, everyone at my age have been graduated from college, have their own place, engaged or married, kids or even their own business.

findapath,don't know what to do with my life,24 years old and don't know what to do with my life,"For context, I'm an artist and I have a BFA in illustration. I do not regret going to school, as I developed a lot as a person and as an artist, but my degree won't get me into any in-house artist jobs. I have no knowledge of graphic design, web design, 3D design, etc. I like to do very basic graphic design but I don't think I could build a career on it. I know I could start an art related business but I'm very tight on money and my apartment doesn't allow for much room to store supplies (plus starting an art related business/taking commissions isn't really reliable income).

I've been unemployed for about half a year. I worked at a family run foundry doing customer service, file work, and making graphic art. I only worked that job for about 5 months and it was my first real job out of college. I'd been unemployed before then, mostly working on my art. I was let go because of financial issues at the foundry and have been looking for employment ever since.

I have no idea how many jobs I've applied to by now, and the amount of times I've heard back is negligible. I was offered an interview for a job I realized I can't even accept because of the commute (I do not drive because I am disabled). I would have a very difficult time working heavy customer service or food service because of my limited abilities in those areas. I'm not trying to be picky, but my partner does have a stable job and we make enough to pay rent so we're not relying on me to get a job.

I really just want to work again because my life doesn't feel like it's going anywhere. I want to work something fulfilling, I'd love the idea of working for a museum, or local small business, or something niche/creative, but I'm having a difficult time finding anything. I know a lot of people are struggling right now, and it's not just me, but it's extremely tiring and it's really been getting to me lately.

How do you find niche careers to get into? Where can I even take my skills from here? I'd love to learn something new, I'm very good at learning new skills. Maybe be an apprenticeship, but I don't even know where to find those (I never see them posted). I know I'm still young and I have time but every day I get more and more into a depressive slump about it.

Sorry this post is kinda long, I thought describing my situation as much as possible would help. Any advice is greatly appreciated.",10,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1lssf84/24_years_old_and_dont_know_what_to_do_with_my_life/,1751775504.0,peachesncloverart,1lssf84,advice_seeking
findapath,career change at 30/40,40F single childless with no direction,"Back story- I’m a product of the Great Recession. I got out of college in 08. I had to move back home where there was only 3 industries. Education, aerospace, and healthcare. Most young people left. I struggled substitute teaching. Knowing I wanted to leave I didn’t date because I didn’t want to get stuck there. At 30 I accepted just getting my teaching credentials. There were no full time positions prior to 30 available. It took me until 34 to complete. I worked for 4 yrs but was forced to leave my area and with savings I could finally do that. Now that I’ve left I realized just how much I missed out on finally living on my own and I’m so depressed. I have no partner or children. I’m going through therapy realizing some trauma i experienced with the relationships with my parents. Most 40 years old have families and I’m alone. I feel like I’m in the social stage of life. Do I create a community where I’m at, make another career change to something I might want to do and I wasn’t forced into, move to a part of the country and start over in a new part of the country, just accept being alone and adopt a kid where I’m at? I’m so lost. I have retirement saving now, but no emergency fund, and a steady job but I don’t want to die alone. Help.

findapath,career change at 30/40,Where do I go from here?,"I’m almost 30 years old and have been working shitty retail/sales jobs for the majority of my 20’s. I moved out of my mom’s house for a couple years but eventually moved back. It’s depressing seeing classmates from high school with families, careers, and I’m here stuck. I had a fair bit of issues with addictions, mostly drugs and food. I have been to rehab multiple times and thankfully I have been able to stay away from hard drugs for the most part. I have a good amount of anxiety/OCD, perfectionism, negative thinking and bad habits. I want to do better but change feels like a struggle and it seems that every time I try, I could never stick to it and stay consistent. Eventually I always “fall off”. It’s like I know what to do, what could help me but I over analyze everything and I’m always jumping from one idea to the next. I have issues sticking with something.

I hate my current job and I know I have to make a decision and get out. Even some kind of tech support/customer service role would be better than what I have now. Remote would be the cherry on top. I am definitely considering going back to school but I don’t know what to study. I am about 40% finished with an engineering degree and have taken a good amount of math and science courses. I don’t think I want to continue with the engineering degree because I had a really tough time with calculus 3 and failed twice. This was during Covid where everything was online and my instructor was honestly terrible, never graded homework and it was very much a self study class with 0 lectures. After failing twice I got very discouraged and once again gave up on schooling. I am thinking to finish some kind of online degree at WGU just to have a degree for cheap. It seems like a lot of jobs are gatekept behind degree requirements and I want to finish what I started (bachelors degree) so that I can move on with my life. I feel like this is holding me back and keeping me in dead end jobs. Even some kind of certificate could help me get past these dead end jobs. 

It feels like I have been trying to figure out my passion, what I like to do, since high school. And the analysis paralysis is insane - caused me to get overwhelmed and never make a decision. I know I am good at problem solving, I’m curious by nature and I have a logic oriented thought process. I think some kind of analyst/IT/accounting role could be good for me. I consider myself an introvert but ironically I have been in sales for several years. I wouldn’t say I’m bad at it I enjoy talking with people and helping them but something that will bring them joy. However I hate the aggressive type selling and worrying about quota. I don’t think this type of pushy aggressive selling aligns with my personality at all. I’ve tried it and it feels forced. I have back issues and I know I’m not cut out for very physical type jobs. I would love to have some nice office job where I am rewarded for good ideas, project work, technical expertise, and client support. I think I could really grow in a role like that. I feel like I have good creative problem solving skills and I could offer a lot in the right position. However I know to get a nice job like this I probably need a degree. I’m not sure what kind of “general” degree would be best so that I could have different options in the types of careers/fields I can work in. I would love to work remote so I try to research fields that have this possibility. 

However, a lot of desirable fields that offer good pay and remote work such as data analysts, programmers, accountants, etc. seem to be in danger from AI. To add onto all my worries and make my decision making even harder, I fear also that I will waste years studying or working in a career that will just be replaced by AI. I’m stuck and I need help. 

Sorry for the very long post I just had to write this all out and get it out. 

TLDR ; I’m 30 living with my mom and feel like a failure. Had a lot of issues with drug addiction and wasted many years as a result. I’m much better now though.  Almost no social life and no respect from family. Have no idea which direction I should go in. Analysis paralysis with all the different career paths, and wondering which is best for me and won’t be replaced by AI. I want to lock in and start my journey down a path to improve my life but there are so many paths and I don’t know which one to go down.

findapath,career change at 30/40,I have no direction in life and I don't know what to do,"I'm 27(M) and I have no direction in life and I feel like any progress in my life is all but impossible. For me it seems as though the three main things you're supposed to be working on in your 20s, based off my friends and peers is; 

1. Starting a career/dream job/passion
2. Moving out of your parents house
3. Being in a relationship or actively dating. 

When it comes to these three I feel so behind or its impossible to make any progress on any of these things. For some needed context, I started University in August 2017 and graduated in December of 2022 with Bachelors of Science in Communication studies and a minor in History. I honestly only chose that major/degree because by halfway through university I had changed my major 3 times (started with culinary arts, them to political science, then to History) and I wasn't 100% sure what I wanted to do career wise and I was told by my advisor that getting a degree in Communication studies was the perfect fit for students ""who don't know what they want to do"" and its a jack of all trades master of none degree. Ok cool. I do that and graduate and it wasn't until late July of 2023 that I could land a job.......working part time. I took what I could get and it paid pretty well for part time. But again not what I went to school for and it wasn't full time or had benefits. Regardless I did end up really enjoying working in that kind of enviroment and was considering looking to maybe this is what I can make a career into. That was all thrown out the window because in the beginning of 2024....my mom got diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer. I put my entire life on pause and became my mom's primary caretaker from January until she passed away in September with little to no help. My mom's family lives outside the US, my older brother could only help here and there because he has his own family and was in the process of moving. My sister moved 2 hours away to begin University and my dad mentally checked out the entire time and didn't lift a finger for my mom. On top of all of that I was my mom's power of attorney and executer of her will and had to handle all the post death responsibilities, etc. By the end of last year I was emotionally and physically exhausted and felt so much intense trauma from losing my mom...who I was extremely close with.....after all of that, beginning of this year I got fired from the job I had, basically being told that all the stuff going on in personal life was effecting my work perfomance....it felt like a kick in the teeth ngl after everthing that had happened. I don't hold any grudges about it. It just sucked. Anyhow, now I am working, again, part time, as a office manager in training for a start up company that my friend linked me up with. 

I just feel so defeated and worthless because I still don't know what I want to do career wise. Everyone I know is working full time either in a career path they want to be in/went to school for or are just working as cooks or food service work but it gives them money to live on. For me I feel as though I am not smart enough to get ""respectable"" career but I am not thick skinned enough to work 40 hours a week at a restaurant like some of my friends. Out of my friend group, only me and two others actually finished university but I am the only one who hasn't figured out what his career or goal in life is. A few weeks back I was talking to one of my relatives about my future and she told me that ""you are in a weird place right now. You are too old to not know what you want as a career or not have made progress in a career. But you are still young enough to learn new things. So you really need to figure out what you want to do in the next year or two, if not life will be 20 times harder for you"". I know my aunt means well but my god being told that just makes me feel worse about myself. That I basically have until I am 28 or 29 to figure my shit out or its game over. I just don't know what exactly I want to do career wise. It doesn't help that with almost every job I have had, I had coworkers or bosses tell me that I am not good at it or I complain about XY&Z about me and it just makes me feel even more worthless. Like I can't do anything right. 

The two other points, moving out and being in a relationship.....I have made zero progress on. 

I wanted to move out since I was 20 but decided not to because I felt it wasn't the right time for different reasons. Originally it was because after high school, I didn't have much money saved up and wanted to build my finances. Then it was because I wanted to wait until I finished university, then after graduating it was until I got a job, then it changed to ""until I get a full time job"" and then when my mom got sick I had to stay at home to take care of her. And now its back to ""I need a full time job to pay rent."" I am the only person I know who hasn't moved out of his parents house and I feel so ashamed about it. Mostly because it feels such an easy step into being a real adult but I never get the chance to do so. Even one of my friends called me out on it and said to me 3 months ago ""you keep making excuses not to move out of your parents house. Aside from taking care of your mom, every reason you give is an excuse. Most people who even work part time or who were in university still moved out. At this rate you're gonna be in your 40s and never moving out.""

And it just sucks. Cost of living and rent isn't as bad as some parts of the US where I live but its been steadily rising ever since Covid and I don't want to live barely keeping my head above water. But on the other side of things, I currently live with my dad and we don't have the best relationship, especially after my mom passing away, my parents house just feels less like a home to me. My dad doesn't make me pay rent thankfully but I do my part to contribute, like buying my own food, cleaning the house and paying for internet. But I just feel so embarrased and perpetually like a teenager, when I am 27 and still living at home. 

Samething with relationships or dating. I was a late bloomer I guess compared to people I know and didn't start dating until I was 24. Even I never had a real girlfriend. The best I had was a weird situationship with a female friend of mine that was this ""we act and do things as if we are dating but we aren't in a relationship"" it ended up kinda of messy and honestly was the first time I ever had suffered from, as cliche as it sounds, a broken heart. The aftermath of it was pretty traumatic for me. We both ended up just being friends after awhile and mending things. But even then it really just destroyed any motivation 
I had for dating and made my self esteem go rock bottom. Especially seeing basically ALL my friends be in relationships or actively dating/hooking up. For awhile I felt like there was just something about me that made it where dating or actually being in a relationship was just not feasible for me. I have grown a little and I am content/happy with being single. I suppose the issue is, I have been told by both friends and family that me being single isn't a bad thing but because I am not actively dating, the longer I delay being in a relationship or not being married it will just get harder in the future. As another friend put it ""it looks really bad if you are trying to date and you are still living at your parents house. And its even worse that you're in your late 20s and never been in a real relationship or two. By the time you're 30, most woman are expecting you to have kids or marry or both.""
And man....it just feels so overwhelming. I am fine with not dating yet I am being told its the wrong thing to do. I honestly don't know if I want to get married, I don't feel prepared for it and while I don't hate kids, I really do not want to have kids of my own. 

So it all just seems like I am running circles and making zero progress. Can't move out because I haven't figured out my career/can't afford to move out, but actually I should move out because its apart of being a ""real"" adult and you can't date unless you have your own place. I just feel like giving up at this point. ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1j61oxq/i_have_no_direction_in_life_and_i_dont_know_what/,1741385208.0,nexusjio19,1j61oxq,advice_seeking
findapath,career change at 30/40,Trying to get past all the trauma ,"41M, I had a traumatic event that happened in my life seven years ago and it left me in a mental state that felt irreparable.  The last seven years have been lost years.  Years filled with heavy anxiety, depression, panic attacks and suicidal thoughts, where I have not really been functioning at a normal level.  I have spent the last better part of a decade just trying to stabilize myself through mental health resources that I have not progressed with much of anything in my life.  I can’t begin to describe how frustrating it feels to watch everyone around me advance in their lives socially and professionally while I’ve been stuck in place.  And I’m happy for people of course, but it just makes the reality of my situation and the weight of everything I’ve lost that much harder to bear.  I lost everything.  I lost my sense of self, the career I was trying to build, any form of social or romantic life.  I’ve just been alone, here, spiraling from the trauma.  And as I am trying to pull myself out of it now, the realization of all the time that was lost, the thoughts of what my life I could have been, the sheer loneliness of the present and the uncertainty and fear of the future is almost too much to endure.  Your 30’s are supposed to be a time in your life where you build a foundation for yourself in your 40’s.  And that was taken from me.

I am writing this because I wanted to get some advice.  I want to put together a plan for myself (maybe a 5-year plan?).  I can’t change the past or what has happened to me, but I want to focus my energy going forward on things I can change.

I am thinking about going back to school in business and maybe pursuing an mba.  I have a degree in psychology from 2006 so I could transfer some credits around for my business degree.  I was looking into some online schools like wgu, snhu and strayer ect. for affordability and the ability to take things online which would be preferable.  But would going this route carry any real weight for me?  Should I be looking into going back to a state school/university where I achieved my first degree?  Also, I am a realist, with my lack of work experience, unimpressive education/resume and with ageism in mind, will a degree like this at this stage of my life even matter?  I honestly still don’t even have a specific job in mind that I want, but with a business degree and mba it might open a broader range of job and salary options that I don’t have now.  To be honest, I’ve always been, well…a little lost.  I am just tired of feeling like I have zero options.  I want to be more hirable for decent salary positions.  But would going this route open any doors for me?  It’s important at this stage in my life that I am very decisive in what I do and what I put my energy toward.  I am not super old yet, but I am not young, and I don’t have the luxury of much wiggle room to waste.  As far as I am concerned these next few years will very well make or break me.  Also, I haven’t done the school thing in almost 20 years.  I don’t even know if I have the wherewithal with all the stress and anxiety, I deal with daily to do the work.  But I want to try.   Are there any online certifications you guys would recommend that I could be beneficial for me in the meantime and also knock some rust off?

Some days it feels like I am making strides.  Other days, not so much.  I am still here, so I guess that’s not nothing.  I crawled through seven levels of hell just to get to this point and honestly, things are still a struggle.  I was flipping through the channel’s late night last week and No Country for Old Men was on and there was this quote that was in the movie that struck a chord.  It goes, “All the time you spend trying to get back what’s been took from you, more is going out the back door.”  That’s kind of what the last few years have been like for me.  I’ve spent the last 7 years consumed by the trauma of what has happened to me and because of that I’ve lost all the years in between.  And fast forward another five years if things don’t change and I continue like this on the path I am on, I am not going to make it.  And that scares me.  I need to try and change.  I am tired of thinking about the life I could have had.  I don’t deserve this.

Quick note.  I don’t want to ramble on much longer, but I wanted to add a few things for context purposes.  I didn’t want to get bogged down in the details about what happened to me (I will save that for another time maybe) because that’s not what writing this thread is about.  I am writing because I wanted to get guidance on building a path forward for the next few years.  

Also, after reading through a lot of other threads and doing my own research I am probably going to get a lot of people saying I should look into healthcare jobs or go into a trade.  Both sound advice for someone my age looking for realistic opportunities that could lead to decent salary.  But I am not a healthcare person at all.  I am just not built for it.  I get skeeved out when it comes to human bodily stuff.   The same can be said for learning a trade.  I am not a handy guy AT ALL.  It’s important to know who you are and who you aren’t at a certain point in your life.  And I know these jobs are not viable options for me. 

I am tired of feeling like I have zero options.  But would going back to school without a clear directive in mind be a smart move?  All I know is, something needs to change I can’t continue like this, or I won’t make it out the other side.

findapath,career change at 30/40,35m wanting to start new career,"My boyfriend (35M, Pennsylvania) is wanting to start a career after many years of manufacturing experience and his current job as a hospital housekeeper. He currently makes pretty good money doing it since he gets a night shift differential, but would like a more stimulating and better playing job in the coming years. (Inb4 anyone accuses me of trying to change him, this was all his idea, and he asked me for help/support, and I have his permission to share this. He read it over.)

Ideally it would be a job in the same hospital network so he can keep his earned PTO, benefits, and make use of the tuition reimbursement they offer. (I also work for the empire and did a similar thing a few years ago for nursing school and the tuition benefit is legit.)

He doesn't think he'd be a good nurse/MA/CNA, and he doesn't love the idea of coding/programming/CS because he'd rather not sit at a desk all day. Maybe IT would suit him? He also doesn't think he'd be happy with a physical trade since he previously took HVAC courses but didn't like it and chose not to finish the program. He doesn't like taking things apart. 

He has been considering radiology tech, but is somewhat concerned about the math courses as this is not one of his strong points. (I am trying to build his confidence in this area since I went through the same thing, but ultimately got a B in college algebra with lots of studying and some tutoring. I know we're not the same person but I believe in him and his brain is very big.) 

I guess some other roles to be considered are respiratory therapist, lab tech, surgical tech, PT assistant, and anything else with an associates or shorter course of study - he thinks four years of study is too long, especially since he'll have to work while he's in school. If you have any of the above jobs or similar, please share pros and cons! Open to non-clinical roles as well. The hospital network also has outpatient clinics, physical therapy centers, offices, etc. It's huge.

He is very frugal and his home will be paid off by the end of next year, but he wants a job with good earning potential and in which he can put his sharp mind to use. He is very intellectually curious and probably reads 30-40 books a year. He loves history, making music, martial arts, old weaponry, and old ships... though now I'm realizing these things may not have anything to do with working in healthcare, haha.",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1gp9zpe/35m_wanting_to_start_new_career/,1731377387.0,thr-w-w,1gp9zpe,advice_seeking
findapath,career change at 30/40,Completely lost and uncertain whether to trust my new dream of becoming a pilot.,"I (22F) have arrived at a major fork in life and I can’t decide where to go. I recently graduated this spring from RISD in graphic design. I was a top student in my department, recommended by professors to consider Yale for graduate school. Growing up, all I enjoyed was art, which led me to choose art school. However, I also had to devote over a decade of my life to classical music for my parents, which I hated. Rather than spending my childhood exploring my identity and what I enjoyed, all my energy was focused on hustling in things that made me hate myself and my life, scraping up any happiness I could in art. Finally I was allowed to pursue it seriously as a career path as a junior in high school. I was very confident this would be the job I wanted because I knew nothing else that made me happy and I am good at it. During college, I was finally able to freely explore more things. I took lots of classes at Brown because unexpectedly, I enjoyed a lot of STEM courses (physics, astronomy, aerospace engineering) more than a lot of my art courses (letterpress, papermaking, typography). Because of many factors, I felt really lost and lonely in my department the last 2 years. My creative work felt meaningless and I didn’t really belong anywhere. I dreaded graduating and entering industry because I really don't want to slave away for the rest of my career doing what other people want me to do again, I can’t feel the way I felt in music for the rest of my life.

During my time at college, I decided I want to pursue getting a Private Pilot’s License in the near future. I kept that goal for 4 years. After graduating, I had the epiphany that switching my hobby and career would make the most sense for my life goals. I can support my independent creative pursuits better with an aviation career than I can support my aviation hobby with a graphic design career. I’ve done a lot of reflecting and researching because this is a major pivot especially since my 2 interests have basically nothing in common. I know at the end of the day a job is just a job and being a pilot is extremely rigorous and at times monotonous. 

Discussing with my parents, we are not concerned on time or money, but rather whether the career suits me and whether I can trust my sense of happiness if it led me astray in high school when choosing RISD. They believe that going to flight school for the next 6-8 months (about the amount of time I anticipate to get PPL and IR) will mean completely wasting my college degree. As a fresh graduate, I am still hirable but after some time, it will be too late to apply to graduate school. They told me flat out that I can never pursue flying as a career, and believe I should change my goal to becoming a university professor in something related to my degree because I will still get paid a decent amount, have freedom with my work, not interact with a lot of people (because apparently I am not very personable) and fly on the side as a hobby. 

Before telling my parents my career proposal, I took a discovery flight, independently researched everything about the career for months, gathering medical records for a 1st class certificate (which according to the HIMS AME I consulted with, I am definitely eligible for), and studying for ground school. Even at RISD, I constantly talked about flying with my friends. They weren’t even surprised with my new goal. I love solo traveling, I love driving, I love physics, I love constantly learning new things, I don’t want any kids, I’m okay with the weird sleep and work schedule, and I’m okay with moving basically anywhere. I just really don’t have objections to the drawbacks of the career and I know I can succeed if I am determined. Even doing the boring stuff like medical record reviews, I finally feel completely happy and aligned in my life. I wake up everyday with a purpose and the greatest excitement and hope for my future, something I could not find in design. My parents are paranoid that this is all a phase, and I too wondered why I didn’t know about this passion sooner (and therefore choose a different college and major). But I don’t think it would have ever crossed my mind as a child unless I was exposed to it as a possibility because of how niche it is. If it did, I’m sure I would’ve considered more options than art but the way it was growing up it was either art or CS.

I am utterly lost. I am completely in love with flying and heartbroken at the prospect of never even trying to get those ratings. And my relationship with art has clarified and changed during my time at school. It’s probably major burnout, but I don’t think going to graduate school is going to make it any better. I feel like without flying, my future is closing in on me. 

My logic is that I can pay for PPL and IR at a local Part 61, and then know for sure whether aviation is a good career path for me because most people drop out at that point if it’s not interesting, too expensive, or too challenging. I believe my desire to pursue it professionally will be nagging at me during and after graduate school. But to my parents, this is just history repeating itself and they predict 5 years into being a pilot, I will regret it and not be able to switch to anything else. To me, going to graduate school just because it’s what makes sense with my major before trying out flight school will be a waste of money if I still want to go to flight school after. And it’s actually advantageous I majored in something unrelated to aviation, as most people suggest doing. I have no desire to be a professor, and I think at that level you should at least care about teaching and be devoted to your craft. I know that being a pilot will be a long, tough road ahead. But I feel like my parents are romanticizing the path and experience of being a professor and telling me what makes me happy rather than listening to my actual experiences just like what they did when I was a kid. I also feel frustrated that they are adamant that most people don’t like their job just because they don’t like theirs. So many people become pilots at 30, 40, as a second career. So many people have careers unrelated to their degree. I feel like it’s okay to change your dreams in life because we change as people. And it’s a low risk prototype to test out aviation with ratings I intended to get anyways, whether for a career or hobby. And I am under the impression that pilots eventually get enough free time to have pursuits outside of aviation (by that time I’m sure I will enjoy art again if I get to choose what projects to do). 

I feel like I’m masquerading as a mature adult because I didn’t get to explore who I was as a child. How do I know whose voice to trust? How do I know which path won’t lead to regret? How do I not make stupid naive decisions? I don’t want to be overly swayed by my music trauma, but I don’t want to abandon the lesson from that which was to trust my inner voice over other people’s expectations. Either way, graduate school and flight school will take the same amount of time and money which is not a concern for my parents. They just really do not believe I am suited for the career.",5,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1fufvwy/completely_lost_and_uncertain_whether_to_trust_my/,1727874821.0,mkxf,1fufvwy,advice_seeking
findapath,career change at 30/40,How to move out of parents' house,"I (29 M) have spent pretty much all of my 20s living in my parents' house.  Iwas forced to quit my job as a web developer in 2022 due to a family emergency.  Following that event, I tried (but failed) to make my own video game to sell, I bit off more than I could chew with that project.  

But now I have a goal of moving out of my parents' house before I turn 30.  While my parents are good people, I still want the freedom that comes from living on my own.  I've been trying to leverage my degree by applying to jobs for the past several months, but after many many applications I've only had two interviews, neither of which went anywhere.  I've had even less luck when I've applied to hardware jobs (as a Computer Engineering student, I had hardware design classes).

And truth be told- I'm very tired of programming anyway.  I used to love programming when I was in school, but programming 40+ hours per week killed my love for it, not to mention that I hate sitting down at a desk for 8 hours straight.  I get restless XD

I wouldn't mind a career change, if there's something I could move to that would cover living expenses.

That said, I know the job market is rough for everyone right now, so at the end of the day I'll take what I can get.

So what should I do?  Should I stay the course and keep applying for programming jobs?  Or is there a better, more in-demand career path that would pay well enough?  I'm also open to whatever other advice you may have.",15,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1gnsfq1/how_to_move_out_of_parents_house/,1731212407.0,PancakesTheDragoncat,1gnsfq1,advice_seeking
findapath,career change at 30/40,"Holy cow this a long post, sorry. But seriously, I am LOST. ","I have no idea how to start this other than to dive in.

In January of 2020, I started interning at a physical therapy center because I was super interested in fitness, helping people, and just diagnosing and solving problems. I knew I couldn't be a doctor because I pass out when I see blood or gore (the amount from a knee surgery doesn't bother me, I know PTs see some blood).

I was taking college classes while in high school, so this freed up my Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday mornings, which I would spend interning at the PT clinic until I had to go to high school at 11:30 or so. I couldn't do much, but watch and fetch (which was still more than enough for me) and I loved it. 

Three months later, COVID happens and I'm (rightfully) no longer allowed to intern because only essential personnel are working (it was literally just the doctors doing essential care).

Fast forward to my freshman year of college later that year, I started my degree in Kinesiology (Exercise Science) hoping to put myself on the path to PT school. I struggled making new friends because of COVID restrictions, I still found a job and made a few friends, but the job sucked (washing dishes till 1 AM) and I was working way too much. My grades started slipping and I started to dislike school. Jump to the spring semester of the following year, 2021, and I'm doing much better. Living in a house off-campus, working out regularly, my grades are improving, but I still don't have any social exposure or friends.

However, things started to turn for me. The lack of friends, combined with the stress of school, and at the  time, I had been asked to vacate where I was living (due to the lender's issues not mine), and I couldn't find anywhere affordable and elected to move home. I pretty much lost it and had a breakdown, I shaved my head (I had VERY long hair at the time). 

I had heard from professors and through other people that Physical Therapy would be a very saturated field by the time I was a PT and that paying back student loans from PT school was very hard because of low pay. This fact, in combination with my lack of social life, and probably depression, for some reason led me to change my major. I think I was just searching for something in my life to change that would help me. I wish I hadn’t. 

Fast forward even further, I did a year of Political Science which I hated, at a school I hated, living with people I hated, and ended up moving back home…again. I finally landed a full time job, moved out into my own apartment (with my parent’s help) and started back up with school, this time in supply chain management. 

I’m a very detail oriented and “logical” person, so it seemed like a good fit. I have my associate degree and I am currently working on my bachelor’s degree. I got a job in the industry before I even had my associate’s degree, which means I’m pretty underpaid, but I do okay, by no means am I struggling. 

However, I hate it. Everyday is the same, and I know for a fact that I can’t do another 20 years of staring at screens all day. I still wake up every day at 4 AM to go work out. I love working out, it really keeps me sane. I can’t stand sitting all day long, and I especially can’t stand corporate computer work. 

Given everything, and my complete lack of interest in this career field, should I change my major and try again for PT school? I just feel like I’m heading towards a life I’m going to hate. 

For a little more context, I’m 22 years old, living with my girlfriend, I actually still have no friends, and I have a full time (40 hours/week) job, and I take classes fully online. As another FYI, I’m taking 4 classes per semester, but it’s 2 eight-week classes at a time, which only adds to the difficulty and stress and I still won’t be finished with my bachelor's degree until December 2026.

If I wanted to do this, I would have to drop my whole life and move back in with my parents. I wouldn’t be able to make the grades I need unless I move home and focus on school only. Some classes would still work for my degree, but I would basically be starting over.  I think I could do it, but the last time I moved in with them, I kind of had another breakdown; however, I think this was mostly due to the fact that I was just lost and had no idea what I wanted to do. I think if I were to move back home with more of a purpose, I would be fine. But would it be fair to my girlfriend? I just asked her to move in 3-4 months ago, and she found a very well paying job with few hours, amazing pay, and unlimited PTO. She maybe works 30-35 hours a week and easily makes 1.5x what I do. 

I know this is rambling now and this entire post was one long run on sentence, but what should I do? Do I drop my life and move home to try for PT school again or do I ride this out until I finish school and see if being more qualified makes it any better? I feel like I’m heading towards another ‘breakdown’, but I feel less “allowed” to have one since I’m more grown and independent and I have other people around me relying on me. Also might post this in a mental help subreddit lol. Thank you in advance for any help or advice, and for reading that entire mess.  

TLDR: I hate my school and my job. I want to move in with my parents and try again for my original degree which I think I would like more. Should I give up everything I’ve worked for so far?

(tl;dr) I'm in my late 30s, single, no family, no pets. Career burnout. After being self-supporting for decades I had to move back with my parents. Where do I go from here?

I'm trying to get my life back on track after more than a decade working office jobs and making very good money as an engineer. I don't think I can work in an office ever again. I went from a six-figure salary (2021) to now being unable to afford a 1BR apartment in a low-cost-of-living town.

I had to move back in with my parents after two decades of being self-sufficient and it's driving me nuts to be back here. I have a part-time hourly wage job to pay the bills I do have.

I'm trying to start over and make a career change. I'm thinking about healthcare and I'm happy to get a second bachelor's degree. I'm considering becoming an RN and finding a specialty. I've also considered healthcare technician jobs such as in imaging (Radiology technician, etc).

I can move anywhere in the country but I want to make a decision that will improve my job security and my future finances. I can't afford to get a useless certificate or degree.

Curious if anyone has advice, comments. Is there a US city or an area that is desperate for workers right now? Should I go to trade school or enlist in the Navy?

findapath,go back to school,"28F, accepted to med school, didn’t go, started an agency, life happened and I’m starting from scratch and I feel so lost.","Using a throwaway account, but pretty much the title.

Seven years ago I got into one of my dream med schools. I decided not to go, a decision heavily influenced by a really terrible person in my life (didn’t realize this until later). 

I don’t necessarily regret the decision, it’s something I’ve had to come to peace with. My undergrad degree was neuro from a reputable school and I did the million and one things you have to do to get into a good med school.

Afterwards, I made a living for myself in social media, content creation, and branding. At the peak of my business I was making about $150k, had a small team of freelancers I managed, and had room to grow, but things crashed in burned as I got into an abusive relationship that pretty much destroyed my mid twenties and the agency I built.

Fast forward, life starts looking up. I met the love of my life and I’ve done a lot of work in therapy to move on from my past. As I feel ready to tackle my professional career, I get long COVID and pretty much become housebound and ill for the last year.

I’m finally healed from that, but after a year of being sick and approaching 29, I am essentially starting from a blank slate yet again. It’s hard not to be on the comparison train of my friends who are either starting their residency or established in their career. 

Right now, I’m making probably around $80k as a freelancer, but in a VHCOL area and with no real trajectory at the moment unless I decide to build an agency again.

I love the freedom having my own business gives me, but I’m getting to a point in my life where I really crave financial stability and I’m fucking tired. 

All the work that went into building my first business - the idea of repeating it, even if I can do it better this time around, feels so daunting. With AI, I’m concerned about the viability of my job. 

I have no idea if my degree or work experience or if being an entrepreneur is appealing to anybody or if I need to go back to school for a complete career change.

I know I am smart and capable and believe I do have a lot of skills to offer, but I have no idea what I can be doing. 

So it’s really three options:
(1) rebuild another business, which I can do and know I can do well and probably make around $150-$200k a year within a year or two.

(2) Consider going back to healthcare and buckle up for a seven year journey ahead (or consider a nursing degree for a shorter time period over an MD)

(3) See if my experience makes me viable for some other market in corporate",28,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1lz303l/28f_accepted_to_med_school_didnt_go_started_an/,1752438577.0,premedthrowaway32,1lz303l,advice_seeking

Can’t thank everyone enough for the advice, please keep it coming! 

Hello all!
I’m strongly considering taking out some loans and going back to college. I’m quite passionate about the outdoors and the environment and would ideally like to work in a related field.
Right now I’m thinking of a Professional Studies major with a minor in Environmental Science. I have an Associate’s in Arts plus 40 or so additional credit hours.
Professional Studies is a “degree completion” type major that would allow me to transfer most of my coursework and apply it to a Bachelor’s. I would be able to complete the program in about a year - two with the environmental science minor.

Alternatively, I could major in Environmental Science. Less of my credits would transfer over and it would take at least 3 years.

I plan to work part time while in school and my wife works full time. We would be looking at a max of 2K in loans per semester.

My concern is that I have heard so many stories, both from people in my personal life as well as from here on Reddit, of people who got a “useless” degree and now are saddled with debt as a result. 
I’d love to not have a similar story.

Since 2021 I've worked at a grocery store, an entertainment place, and now I work at a museum (greeting people, helping guests, selling tickets, etc.) Getting a job with my degree will be even harder now since I've been out of school for four years and since there are far less computer science related jobs available now. I really want to get a ""professional job"" that will offer a good salary and be a good career to have. Since I've had so much trouble using my degree, I was thinking of going back to school in the fall for an engineering degree (love everything engineering related, love physics, really interested in all the subjects, heard the engineering market is pretty good, etc.) and just becoming a seasonal employee for my current job. Some relatives of mine, however, are discouraging it. They tell me that instead of going back for a degree, I should just go take a few more classes at college so I look like I care about my education, and while I'm at college I should talk to the guidance counselors, people there who have job experience, etc. which will help me get a job with my current degree.

I really don't want to be discouraged. I've become super interested in engineering and would love to be an engineer, I really want a plan for my future, I really don't like the current job market related to my degree, and I just want to start over with a new degree.

I have a bachelor’s in Music Education and a master’s in Jazz Studies. My original goal was to become a music teacher, either at the secondary or university level. After grad school, I worked as an adjunct professor for a year — it was fulfilling and aligned with my goals, but it didn’t pay the bills.

Now I work as an Administrative Assistant in the College of Fine Arts Dean’s Office at a large university. The pay isn’t amazing (\~$50k), but it’s a good change of pace, solid resume builder, and comes with excellent tuition reduction benefits.

That said, I’m feeling pretty burnt out on music and teaching right now. I’m considering using the tuition benefits to get a second bachelor’s in something more practical, but I’m also wondering if this admin role could be a solid jumping-off point for higher-paying positions — maybe even outside of higher ed. I'm not opposed to staying in administrative roles.

So, my main question is:  
**Is there real potential for growth and better pay on the admin path I’m currently on? Or would it be smarter to use the tuition benefits now and get a more ""practical"" second degree?**

findapath,is a master's degree worth it,"Is it worth staying in an expensive city to try to find a job related to my degree that could potentially lead to a higher salary in the future, or should I take a warehouse job in a cheaper city with poor job opportunities that pays slightly more than what I'm making right now?","Apologies if this is not the right subreddit for this post, but I was just looking for some advice about my current situation.


TLDR:

Working for a small biotech startup in Canada (Toronto area) with limited growth potential and thinking of taking another job that pays slightly more in a cheaper city closer to family that doesn't need a degree. Is this a stupid idea or should I continue to try to find something related to my degree that has more salary growth potential?


Background:

I'm 29 years old with a BSc in Biochemistry from an ok university. I did 2 coop terms (8 months in an R&D lab and a year doing pharmaceutical QC testing) both at large, well known companies. I graduated in 2022 and got a full time position later that year at a biotech startup in the Toronto area doing method development for pharmaceutical QC tests. I have also been working on getting my Masters in Computational Biology part time remotely to try to get a better job in the future. I know remote degrees aren't considered to be as good, but there was no other way I could afford to do grad school that would also allow me to continue working.


My current situation:

The company I'm currently at has been having financial problems for the past 2 years, but has continued to pay its employees regularly. However, it frequently avoids paying a lot of its vendors to the point where they put our account on hold and threaten to go to collections for payments. Usually they end up paying at that point, or will pay just enough to free the account so we can order materials from them again. It is currently owned by a private equity firm that is trying to sell it to a new investor.

This company also promised everyone a bonus for the last 2 years in a row, but they have been ""on hold until they receive more funding"", despite saving money on payroll from 5 employees leaving over the past 2 years. I did get a 5% salary increase last year, however. This year they did not even do the performance reviews that bonuses and merit increases are based on.

I have been trying to find another job since 2023 that would either be a lateral move or a step up. Not just because of the company's financial situation, but because of other management/structural issues with the company and a lack of growth and development opportunities.

I would estimate that I have probably applied to around 1000 jobs since 2023 and have had a handful of interviews. I've tried redoing my resume and cover letter several times, and tailoring it to the job position as well. I've had a couple of interviews that seemed to go well, only to be never contacted again, even after attempting to follow up. I had one interview for a position that was basically doing technical support and dispatching service technicians for lab instruments that paid 30% more than my current position, but the interviewer said I was overqualified for the position, and it would be a waste of my skills to work in that position. Apparently they were going to keep my resume on file though for more suitable positions, but I never heard back from them.

I thought by this point in my life I would have a better quality of life than I did when I made minimum wage 10 years ago, but I made poor career decisions in my early 20s. I have been considering taking a job that is completely unrelated to my degree back in my home province that is significantly cheaper than the Toronto area. My parents have also said I could stay with them rent-free for a while if I wanted to.

I applied to a position that is basically just receiving things, storing them in a warehouse and updating inventory numbers for a federal government department. If I got that job, I could afford a car and would be closer to my family, in addition to saving approximately $2000 a month if I don't have to pay rent. Currently, I'm only saving about $200 a month with most of my money just going to pay rent. I'm aware that I could save a lot more by getting roommates, but I've had such terrible luck with roommates in university that I never want to do that again. I also know that I'm paying above market rates for rent because it's dropped since 2022, but I've been worried that my current company could lay me off at any time, and didn't want to get locked into a 12 month lease with no employment prospects.

findapath,is a master's degree worth it,The Post-College Reality Check Hit Me Like a Truck,"It's been a year since I finished my master's degree, and I'm having one of those existential moments that I need to get off my chest.

All through university, I had this vision of what working life would be like. I worked my ass off because I believed in the dream : get good grades, land a solid job, have security and respect. It seemed like the logical path, the safe bet everyone talked about.

Here's the thing, I actually landed at a pretty cool company. They don't pressure me, the environment is decent, and on paper I should be grateful. But that's what makes this whole thing even more confusing.

Even with a decent job, the whole concept feels soul-crushing. Is this really it? Did I spend all those years studying just to end up in this cycle of wake up, work, sleep, repeat?

The more I think about it, the more I feel like we've been sold a lie since we were kids. ""Study hard, get good grades, find a stable job, and you'll be set for life."" But nobody told us that being ""set"" would feel this empty. Nobody mentioned that most of your waking hours would be spent doing things that don't really matter to you, just so you can afford to... keep doing it. And the cherry on top? I can finish a week's worth of work in 4 hours, but I still have to sit there for the remaining time pretending to be busy because that's just ""how it works.""

Anyone else feeling this way? How do you cope with the realization that adult life isn't what you thought it would be, even when you're ""lucky"" to have it good?",273,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1ldm0pg/the_postcollege_reality_check_hit_me_like_a_truck/,1750163844.0,Intelligent_Echo3306,1ldm0pg,advice_seeking
findapath,is a master's degree worth it,I chased the dream of moving abroad....Now I’m wondering if it was worth it,"I'm a 28-year-old engineer from LATAM, finishing my master's in Scandinavia—a lifelong dream. But after years abroad, doubts are creeping in about whether leaving for a better life was the right choice.

Life abroad hasn’t been what I expected. I’m isolated, basically 0 friends and dating 0 girls since I arrived and facing financial, language, and job market limitations. I worked for some years before my masters and thought my CV was going to be attractive, but when looking for a job, despite couple of years of experience in renowned companies, visa restrictions and a tough job market have left me with only two interviews after hundreds of applications.

Therefore, my second thought is just to return home where my life would be very comfortable overall but when evaluating and applying to some job positions I realized my salary would be similar to what I’d earn if I had stayed instead of pursuing a master's.  
  
So now I cannot stop asking myself, **was this abroad experience worth it????**

While I’ve gained valuable experiences—traveling, meeting people, and learning— basically I’m in debt, all this masters degree and travels have  been funded by family and a study loan. Meanwhile, friends and family see me as ""the one who made it"" in Europe, assuming staying equals success. So I feel some pressure behind me, knowing that if I return I would be seen as failure.

I don´t know, it just feel bad to realize that the path I pictured woud lead me to professional and prsonal development is not as I expected. I just don´t want to return home as if all of this did not matter.

findapath,is a master's degree worth it,Don't write off college early,"Hello, fellow Path-Finders, I've been sitting on this thought for quite a few days! There is a single statement, a single bullet point that I see in this sub nearly constantly that as someone planning on returning to college, is quite disappointing and drawn out. I'm sure you've heard or even perhaps wrote: ""College isn't for me,"" or ""no college degree jobs,"" or any of the other various forms of writing it. 

My simple plea is to *please* at least investigate it. It's not the same system as it was even 5 years ago. It's far easier to fit it into your life and, if you're an older student, it's far easier to get in than as a 18 year old. Often times employers pay or will help pay for it too!

So many people here, including my past self, put on these fictitious binds. It limits your opportunities, compensation, and upwards mobility by a near unfathomable amount. Before taking college off the table entirely, at least do some investigation into it. Community colleges can make it affordable, online classes can make it so you can fit it in your busy schedule, and there's a degree out there that benefits nearly any career path. 

The statistics are also pretty convincing of this, the picture shown is one of many. Even with the debt, picking up a bachelor's can give you *much* more access to various careers, resources, and potential. Although the burden is there, finances, time, stress, the effort is worth it. 

I am likewise guilty of this: I looked for jobs specifically avoiding returning to college, now that I see how necessary it is for advancement, I'm going back again. Knowing how much of an effect it has on my career future makes it so I am actually excited to return instead of anxious.

My personal opinion on it always has been, try to find an industry or niche you like, then try to find a degree to compliment it. Huge bonus points if you already have a job in it and using the degree for advancement only.",92,https://i.redd.it/e1yfy9b14zfe1.png,1738174110.0,behannrp,1id09u4,advice_seeking
findapath,is a master's degree worth it,Advices to those who are 18 - 30 years old and struggling or lost in life!,"Congrats 🎉🎈🎊 for getting your High School diploma (16-19 yo). Now what? Now the real life begins. Keep in mind that you are not late! Just stop wasting time on things that are not necessary at all, stop blaming others for X,Y, and Z! It’s time to move forward and grow up. I will show you below that you can turn everything to your favor now and that it is not too late to make it right: 

1. Yes, you can take a gap year or 2 gap years to rest, think carefully about your major or travel 🧳 to see your longtime family members and friends.
2. After that, please enroll at a community college (it’s ok to start at the age of 20-25 yo). It’s mostly free nowadays in many states (I will put a link down for you later in the comment). You can complete your first college degree in 2 years or 3 years max - it’s called an ASSOCIATE DEGREE. A major is STEM or HEALTHCARE is always rewarding. It’s ok if you don’t find a job right away, but keep looking and be open minded about jobs you can land for now (working at a gas station, retail, babysitting, dog sitting, Ubereats, instacart…) even if it does not not fall immediately under your major since it will be your first time job!
3. Congrats on getting your Associate Degree (age 22 - 27 is still fine)!! Take a gap semester if you want and then, Transfer to a 4-year institution (also mainly free nowadays with tons of grants, scholarships and more). Even if your grants and scholarships don’t cover everything, you can try to compensate the rest of your tuition with $5,000 - $18,000 loans given by the financial aid office to finish your degree! Again, in here, it will take you 2-3 years to finish with your bachelor’s degree 📜, which is now the MINIMUM DEGREE required by most places if you want to be well off. You can still continue to work part-time just to save enough money (also save all your refunds from fir tuition to put into your saving account) so that once you complete your degree, you can rent your first apartment or studio or basement or a room to start living your life away from your parents’ house if you truly want to be free/independent and take your own life into your hands!! While you are a student, also keep looking for internships, co-op, summer undergraduate opportunities that will give you hands on experiences + stipends to put into your saving account again! 
4. Congrats on getting your Bachelor’s degree 📜 (age 24 - 29)! Now, it’s time to leave your parents and face another reality. You should have saved enough money to really afford your next 1-2 years of rents. Your loans have a grace period of 6 months and after that, you can still extend  it for over a year if you won’t be able to afford paying them back. It’s time to look for another job that pays you well. Look at your college to see if they are hiring for tutors, go to your school and paste on the job board your business information (date, time, availability for private tutoring, private babysitting, private dog care, selling your old books ….). Reach out to your professors as well in terms of job prospect! Some places will still offer internships to newly graduated students within 12 months of graduating if they have not yet found an entry level position!! 
5. You can take a gap year or 2 to continue working fulltime this time, before going for your Master’s degree (optional). Let’s say you start your master’s degree between 25-28 years old. It’s just for 2 years, meaning you will finish it by the age of 27-30 years old! Since you took a gap year, then you will most likely take $10,000 - $15,000 to cover your first semester. But, after that, look for Graduate Assistantship or Teaching Assistantship that will cover your entire tuition until you graduate + stipends for teaching! Or, you can look for internships and co-op as well for graduate students and the students will be enough to cover your tuitions in case you don’t want to teach. Either way, you won’t be drowning into too much debt!

I hope this will help you tremendously! Your 20s are meant to get your priority straight and focusing on just your academic, professional, financial and your own personal growth instead of wasting your time, energy and money chasing men/women (losing your virginity, get addicted to fornication or drugs, alcohol, cigarettes…) knowing that you haven’t accomplished anything yet for yourself nor for your parents (No college degree, not financially stable, still living with your parents…)!
Your 30s are meant to be at least financially secured, have at least your bachelor’s degree, start your career, think about dating, which can lead to a happy marriage with 1-3 kids! We will talk about that later!!

Good luck 🍀! Don’t lose hope at all. It will all be worth it. 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻

I've taught high school science, I've worked in software engineering, I've tried my hand at journalism and broadcasting, and I obtained a relatively useless master's degree... and nothing has brought me fulfillment or peace. 13 years after graduating from college, I am living paycheck to paycheck and crying myself to sleep alone every night, whereas all my peers are married with kids and fabulous jobs. I recognize that I am \*so\* lucky to have had the freedom to do all that I've done; but in my current (very depressed) frame of mind, it feels like I've just been spinning my wheels and wasting my time. Now I have wrinkles, but nothing to show for them, and I can't even look at myself in the mirror.

I always wanted to pursue medicine, but I was afraid: of the time commitment, of the astronomical expense, of the grueling training. Doctors advised me to ""only do medicine if you can't picture yourself doing anything else,"" and so I tried other things. I'm not sure I have the grit and mental fortitude to get through med school and residency, but I can't shake the thought that this is what I was meant to do. I just feel so old and damaged and discouraged... Is this worth pursuing? Is it just another whim? Will I drop out of med school too, but this time with half a million dollars of debt? I lie awake at night, consumed with anxiety and indecision. I just want to have a career in which I truly, meaningfully help people.

findapath,is a master's degree worth it,"I'm almost 30. I attempted to change careers and have 2 graduate degrees, but am struggling.","I got my first master's at 23 in speech pathology, but found myself extremely burnt out on clinical work a few years in. So, I've been trying to change careers since I was 26/27, which first started with a UX bootcamp and later led me to going back and getting a second master's in IT/Web Design which I just finished in August. (Like just about everyone else seeking a job in tech or corporate in general) I'm struggling to find work with this new degree.

It's very frustrating, like I feel like I ""did everything I was supposed to"" and did 2 internships in research/UX research. I'm still at one of these (part time) although it seems like a dead end and I don't foresee it converting to full time work. I'm doing some freelance work (web design/social media management), plus I just picked up a 2nd part time job in my previous field (SLP) to try to rebuild my finances.

Based on the amount of struggle I've been having I've been debating giving up on my career change entirely. I can get work fairly easily in my previous career but I'm not particularly excited about it. My career change was mostly due to wanting to find work which requires less social interaction (I also learned I'm ND shortly after I initiated this process) and helps me to feel less drained. However, I'm now juggling multiple part time jobs and wonder if it's worth it. Plus, I'm almost 30 and have other things I'd like to do with my life (e.g., have a family) and I'm getting tired of focusing entirely on work/career.

I feel like I don't really know what I want to do with my life anymore. At the end of the day, I just want \*something\*. I really like research and data, it doesn't even need to be in the context of UX if I'm being honest. I like design as well, I've considered becoming a full-time freelancer but could see how that could be stressful in its own right (i.e., constantly trying to find clients). But, trying to get just about any job in corporate is incredibly stressful as well and doesn't necessarily provide a stable career either (especially given the constant layoffs going on).

It's just very hard to feel that I'm constantly putting my life on hold for this career change that may or may not happen, with my alternative being staying in a career that I'm not particularly thrilled about that will likely cause me to inevitably burn out.",59,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1ir658e/im_almost_30_i_attempted_to_change_careers_and/,1739749455.0,Greedy_Half6179,1ir658e,advice_seeking
findapath,is a master's degree worth it,Is it still worth pursuing medical school?,"Hello! Been lurking for a while, but i’ve finally reached the point where I feel like I should ask for input. 

I’m (27M) an International Student with two U.S bachelor’s degrees (double major so got them at the same time), and unfortunately had a rough time with distance learning and COVID, my GPA tanked hard, as well as having a really bad first semester of college to begin with, which I know isn’t ideal. So my final GPA is 2.93, I’m also missing some pre-requisites for medical school in the U.S, I’m not sure if I can even fulfill those since you need an F1 Visa to study in the U.S and mine has long since expired. 

I’m asking this as I’ve not had a job in over 4 years, been volunteering and training in hospitals in genetics (lab and clinic) and psychology (one of my bachelors degrees), I enjoyed genetics but Genetic Counseling seems just as difficult to get into in the U.S as medical school is, and I’m honestly not enjoying clinical psych at all. 

I was thinking of pivoting with my Masters to go into a more business focused degree for the possible financial stability, but honestly it’s only because I see so many around me, my age and younger, achieving, progressing, while I just feel stuck. I got accepted into the University of Leeds Organizational and Business Psych program, but is it worth going for med school? If so how? Or am i just being an emotional idiot?

findapath,quit job to start business,quit my six-figure tech job and moved to Bali…feeling more lost but also in the right direction?,"some background, i'm an only child (28F) of extremely overbearing parents who put me through private school and university to be funneled into silicon valley tech. i was good at my job but i found it pointless and full of BS even though i was able to climb up the ranks. i feel there is more to life than money and status - i enjoy traveling, playing music, and living life in the moment and felt truly at peace on a vacation in bali. 

i ended up quitting my job last year with about $60-70k saved up in mostly all former tech company stocks and moved to bali. my cost of living is so low i still have about $50k now and now that a year has gone by, i decided to visit home. i mostly used the past year to travel and take a sabbatical from work. but now, it made me feel like crap being home, everyone around me progressing in their careers, getting married and having kids, my cousins becoming doctors and buying houses. my parents pressure me to get a job back here in tech, but i don't want to. i even rejected a former coworker last week who wanted me to apply to one of his roles at my old company, but he told me ""there's no work life balance, barely any visibility, and 6am as well as late night meeting calls every week"". i didn't feel that i would like so i politely declined but i feel even worse because i know the job market is tough right now and i said no to something people really want. 

i've been home for over a month now and i feel like a failure. i don't know if going back to bali is a good idea but also staying here seems like not what i want either. i was contemplating either going back to bali and being ok with low pay and simple life (trying to start a property management business there but i would probably earn only $1k a month or less and it might not work)...or staying in the SF bay area and maybe becoming a real estate agent (property is something that interests me way more because I like working with people in a sales type of scenario). either way, both places kinda point me more in the direction of property management or real estate, so i seem to be going the right direction, it just seems from a personal life standpoint, I am falling behind with finding a partner and starting a family or getting a house. i don't even think i care about a house, but these things make my parents proud of me and when i don't have a good job, a partner, or a house, they are disappointed in me and i feel like i'm stupid for quitting before. 

i tried finding a remote job in bali but when i look online, i can't find anything that i qualify for or that responds back (which is insane given i worked in silicon valley for 7+ years). i also started my own music business as a musician playing for weddings here in CA so i know how to do website building, online marketing, communications, but it's a gig-based thing and i don't get a lot of money from it. i think i want to stay in bali but figure out a way to make a good living and earn money but i don't know if i should just stay here in SF and make money here or go back to bali and figure out an alternative way of living that everyone back home looks down on me for. 

feeling super lost if i made the wrong decision by leaving my high paying job with no actual plan of how i will stay in bali but it's already done a year ago and i can't change that...has anyone done similar to this or have any advice on how to move forward?

findapath,quit job to start business,Is it wrong to quit my photography business?,"About 18 months ago I started a pet photography business after finally graduating with my BFA and deciding to ditch the job search that wasn't going well. I invested a lot of time and money into the first 6 months. Using every dime I had on equipment, branding, marketing etc. Did a lot of work for free to build up a really good portfolio and make connections. Over the last year I was able to go part time with my day job in order to focus more on my business. Things felt like they were taking off. I did a lot of pop up events over the summer and fall, and get pretty good feedback.

But my biggest struggle has been finding good clients who actually want to pay. Other photographers and potential clients have told me I am undercharging. So I worked on that. It didn't seem to change much. In fact over the last 6 months I've put so much time and energy into trying to fix this problem (endless reading, podcasts, advice seeking, trials and errors, etc) that i've just gotten burnt out. My most recent client felt  like the nail in the coffin.  She seemed like a great client at first, jumped on our initial consultation call. We both decided to move forward as I felt confident I could deliver what she was looking for, and we were on the same page with how my services and pricing are structured. The day before her session she emails me asking if she can change her backdrop color to one shade lighter than her original choice. It was a color I don't have, but I wanted to make her happy so I agreed and bought it. I drove from Hollywood to Long Beach to bring my studio set up to her home the day before Christmas (I offer this as a complimentary service option since some pets don't travel well). The session went great, and I  over delivered the amount of photos I promised (which I do in hopes of selling more prints, which is how my pricing is structured). She reviews her album and books her post session meeting where we go over her order. She didn't hop on the call for our meeting and I start getting this feeling that something feels off. I text her and she jumps on the meeting 15 minutes late. She gets on the call and is raving about how much her and her family loves the photos. I proceed to stay on the call longer than I was planning because I understand that it's my job to help my client feel confident with what photos they are ordering to make the sale. We finalize her order, but last minute she backs out because her husband want's to be present to finalize the order. She said she would get back to me later that week, but didn't. I ended up following up and she basically told me that something changed, and they can't afford to buy anything currently. 

It just felt like a slap in the face because her $100 session retainer fee was eaten up by the the backdrop (that we didn't even end up using because she changed her mind back to the original color), and the gas I used to get to her. I spent about between 25-30 hours on her project in total, and didn't make a dime.

I've run out of steam and I don't have the skin to work with these flakey cheap clients. 

I have been spinning my wheels trying to figure out a bunch of other life things including if I can even afford to continue living in LA. I feel like i keep looking for answers but just find more questions. I also have a print practice and do some community teaching at a print shop which feels really energizing and more rewarding. I also submitted a last minute grad school application because of this. 

I feel at 30 years old I should really just force myself to push through these business woes, because it's like the only accomplishment I really have...on paper at least at that. But would it truly be foolish to shut down my photography business? I can't tell

Generally, I didn’t really plan to work in a hotel but decided to anyway since people were telling me that even if i don’t have a degree, I can still climb up the ladder & have a good position in the future. Also, the travel discounts are really good lol & I travel a lot.

I started off as a front desk agent (hated it) & got promoted to front desk lead then to sales coordinator. I decided to go back to school & will graduate soon. Now I’m looking for other jobs & I’m not ready for a serious position yet.

I’ve always wanted to be a sales coordinator but now that I am, I don’t think I’m destined for an office job. Everyone in the office never moves from their desk, they even eat there & order takeout everyday. I put on a few pounds & now trying to up my step count every hour. I also come in earlier than everyone else (7 AM) so I get my work done early but everyone just thinks I’m not working & gets petty about it. Also, my department kinda just thinks they’re better than every other department because we make money for the hotel & I hate it.

I also hate having to beg for days off & having to accrue PTO. It wasn’t that difficult to request for days off when I was just a front office agent. But when someone from the department uses their PTO then everyone has to pick up their slack & it sucks. Which is also the reason why people in this department hardly ever go on vacation. 

Before this, I was a barista & I honestly would rather be a barista again. After college, I kind of just want to be a barista again & focus on my dog sitting/dog walking business. I hate being cooped up in the office all day & I just feel like I’m wasting my time there. 

My parents are constantly asking what I’ll do next after college & suggesting that I take up a managerial role. I really don’t see myself managing a whole department. I still feel like I’m too young to be taking a career so seriously when I just want to travel & to take it slow.

findapath,quit job to start business,Should I quit my job and try building a business? ,"I’m looking for some advice on whether I should quit my job. I started a new role about 4 months ago, after leaving a company where I had a solid reputation as the top salesperson in the region. I made the switch during a time when office politics were getting pretty bad at my old job. 

The new job pays more and the deals are bigger, but it’s way more work and a lot more complex. The processes here are a nightmare. I’ve moved from new business to managing existing accounts, which are the company’s largest. I went from working pretty independently to needing approval from five different people just to get anything done. It’s been rough. 

Training has been almost nonexistent because they assume I should already know everything, coming from a competitor. On top of that, my boss is really tough to deal with—he’s constantly giving negative feedback and it’s his way or the highway. His communication style is super direct, bordering on rude, and a lot of my colleagues haven’t been very helpful either. The whole vibe of the place just feels off.

On the side, I’ve been working on a business idea that’s starting to show some promise and generate sales. It’s in a totally different field (my job is in SAAS and that business is more product-related). With the end of the year coming up, I’m wondering if I should quit now and focus on my business full-time. I never enjoyed SAAS and only did it for the money. 
I’ve never quit a job without anything lined up. But the job is so demanding and takes up too much of my time and brain capacity.

I was living far away from my family after I decided to go to university when I was around 19. I dropped out after one year and then just started working at different jobs. mostly ranging from only 3-6 months in length. Ranging from painting, working in a bar, to doing some music gigs at bars etc... After a while of feeling lost I moved back in with my family when I was around 24 and I didn't really do anything . I just played games despite my parents effort trying to get me to work and whatever else. After going to a psychologist or therapist I was put on anti depressants and then I got a job working retail for about a year. It wasnt awful but I quit and then went away to school for music which I mostly paid for myself. That was a dumb decision.. It was fun and interesting but finding some sort of job in the industry was pretty daunting and I had to move to another Major city that I wasn't sure I could afford to live in or stay motivated to live in. After finishing that I moved back in with my parents and went to school again for business diploma in human resources. Now years later.. I have no job in HR. Little experience in about 6-7 years working. Just food delivery and don't have a lot of options. I'm 33 now and I feel sad about my life.

I should've just done that longer but yea ... I decided to try and take more debt and finish an extra year of HR but I absolutely hate it. Now I don't know what to do... Little job experience, can't get interviews and kind of feel like I need to work or switch into a new role.. I look like shit, I live in a city where there isnt much to do and I have no friends... I'm thinking I should just try and find some sort of retail management job or something but I don't even have experience... What should I do? I don't take meds anymore either, I don't really go to the gym and I get outside sometimes to walk etc/do my school which is online. It's so shit though and I have no interest in it at all.. I don't want to sound spoiled because a lot of this debt is my own and I took a lot of it myself.. I don't have people who listen to me in real life... I used to be fun.. I used to go out and do stuff but I never got my priorities straight and now I feel so lost... Has anyone been somewhere similar? I've also been quitting porn and gaming which has been so difficult for me... I spent a lot of childhood doing that shit... Thanks for reading if you made it this far. I don't really have anywhere to talk about this in real life.. I don't live with my parents anymore and had a relative pass who gave me a bit of money that I invested so I have a little money for bills and etc. it's not much but I'm fucking stuck right now. I can't seem to get a job and potentially think my resume is just complete shit... I don't even know what industry to try and apply to anymore.. Anyways...

findapath,quit job to start business,I just got fired from a job that I loved and wanted to work hard at. I'm devastated and sick of going through this over and over again. I'm totally lost.,"I'm 34 male. I'll try to be as direct and forthcoming as possible. Very recently I just got fired from a job that I actually loved and cared about that I only worked at for 3 months. It was a warehouse manual labor type of job driving powered equipment and moving product and it was a very physically demanding and very busy, very active job. I started this job with every intentions of keeping it for the long term and be committed, I put my entire efforts and energy into this job, trying real hard to do well, have a good performance, and get alot of products done. I liked everything about this job, doing the work, the people there, and the pay was good. I got fired from this job for attendance and being late too many times. I currently don't have a therapist.

My work week routine was rough, and unfortunately was really starting to get to me after awhile. My schedule was Monday - Friday, 7:00 AM - 3:00 PM which means I would have to start waking up at 4:45 AM - 5:00 AM. I had to take busses to get to and from work, so I would have to leave the house around 5:50 AM to be there at 7:00 AM, work until 3:00 PM, then take busses back home which I wouldn't get home until around 4:15 PM - 4:30 PM. The more and more time would go on, just overall I would get more and more annoyed and aggravated by both my weekly routine, and just feeling like the whole work & life balance is just way off. I would try to do things when I'm not at work but alot of times I would come home too exhausted and tired to really do anything to the point where I really can't do anything productive or anything overly interesting or anything that requires alot of mental effort. Fortunately not all of my days would be like this, but alot of times I would come home and just lay around in bed whether I can sleep or not for the next 3-4 hours and then it's like I don't start feeling like ""myself"" again until later on at night and then all the tiredness and fatigue finally wears off, and I want to start doing things I enjoy doing or get back into my interests again. Alot of the times by that time midnight is fast approaching which means really soon it won't be that much more time later until it's time for me to wake up super early the next morning to do it all over again.

Everything I'm about to say is going to sound very contradicting and even I don't understand why I have these problems but it's like this - on one hand, once again, I really liked this job, I never wanted to quit or get fired, I felt very useful, and felt like I was apart of some sort of ""work family"" and actually cared about the company and the work itself. But on the other hand, it was the overall work week routine and lack of a work/life balance or how stressful the overall work week was that was really starting to get me, and the thing is, this isn't the first time something like this has happened. I get a job, everything starts out great and amazing. Then the more and more time goes on I start to become so deeply dissatisfied with life and start hating the same monotonous routine. I start to get this very annoying sense that the only reason why I live is just to work, and the whole rest of my life or all other aspects of life is just empty and meaningless. I don't have much of a life outside of work, and pretty much have nothing going on. I have no social life, I'm always by myself, I almost never have anything to look forward to, and so on. Even with this being said, I know who I am and what I want in life, I had a shit ton of goals and personal goals that I wanted to achieve while I worked and kept this job that I didn't get a chance to achieve because all of my goals require money, or doing certain things or having certain things which requires money, and I lost this job far before I was able to start doing or having the things I wanted to do or have. I never got to see my life progress like I had planned on. The most recent few weeks that I was at my job, I came home almost everyday too tired to even work on myself or my care about personal goals which would caused me to be even more depressed or burnt out and have me thinking ""Is this all that life is?"". My biggest passion in life has always been towards music and things that are the creative arts. I've always been big into writing full blown music compositions, writing and practicing for piano and having a strong desire to perform and get my music out there, and this is something I've been doing for many years. Working on my music or personal goals seemed like too much effort or too much work with everything else going on, and I would just want to do nothing about it which might be a complete separate issue from work or what the job is entirely, but I don't know. I would start wishing more and more often that this job would start later like even 8:00 AM or 9:00 AM so I could start waking up at a more realistic hour or wouldn't have to get up quite as early, or start wishing that there was some sort of 4 day work week, 3 days off schedule just so that there can be more BALANCE, more time to rest and recover, more time and energy to focus on other things or really have more of your own free time. I would find myself craving an adventure of some sort or something that would bring alot more amazing or different experiences or something that breaks up the monotony. Like, this was a regular 40 hour work week schedule and on this job I was feeling as if I was working more like 60 hours a week. The weekends never felt sufficient, and that would be whether I would have a weekend full of plans, or whether I would just spend the majority of the weekend at home. Waking up at the time I did would just get more and more aggravating. I would be late to work either because of missing the bus, have a hard time getting ready or take longer than usual to get ready, or leaving the house late, or some days wake up and just be very annoyed and pissed off or things get overwhelming at times where it would be like ""I just need a break from all this"" or ""I need more of my own time, so I'm not spending ALL of it at work"". These are not thoughts or mindsets I force myself to think or have, and I realize thinking this way is bad but it just happens automatically, and the frustration of it all just would get worse and worse the more and more time goes on. But at the same time I recognized these thoughts and moods this time around, I tried real hard to block it out and realized that I had to keep working, don't quit, keep going no matter what, work towards your goals and so on...but I was fired.

I'm so angry, lost, confused, and depressed about all of this. By me having this job I felt a sense of purpose and a sense of me really having ""my own thing going for me"" type of thing, which for me is rare. I have lost or got fired from so many jobs over the many years, but only a small few jobs out of all of those I've actually cared about, including this most recent one that I'm talking about. If they would've never fired me, I wasn't going to quit. I was already very unhappy with my life while I had this job, but now that I'm unemployed I still have all the exact same problems plus ALOT more and everything is unbearable. I no longer know what's going on for the short term or far future like I had been thinking and planning all this time, everything is so uncertain anymore. I'm sick of having short periods of time where things go well, and then there are many other times when I'm unemployed or broke, or really struggling with money. I'm nowhere in life right now and I feel like a huge failure. This most recent job loss hurts in a totally different way because I had alot of goals, things I wanted to do and work on that I no longer can because of not having any money or an income. Finding a new job so far has been hard as hell and I've been hitting dead-ends. Everyone else around me or everyone else I know in real life is always doing well, living their own lives always bragging about how good their job is or how proud they are of themselves, always getting and having bigger and better things in life, new apartments/houses, taking trips and vacations regularly, and so on, there is an upwards progression with everyone else, things always get bigger and better. I'm just remaining stuck, never progressing upwards, never living my life how I imagine it or finally becoming the person that I really want to be, reaching my full potential. I'm always wondering what is wrong with me or why I'm not a functioning adult. Everyone else doesn't seem to have these kinds of problems at all and nothing bothers anyone and things seem to come with ease. I'm running out of hope fast. I'm just seeing if anyone has any advice or any similar experiences or if anyone could relate or have some answers.

findapath,quit job to start business,My life at 27 is up in flames,"2 years ago I thought i had it all figured out. Moved into an apartment with girlfriend and had a job i loved. Then I got a medical diagnosis that is manageable, but destroyed me psychologically. I am a hypochondriac.

I eventually got in a fight with my boss, and quit the job, had a public meltdown in doing so too. No one at the job ever talked to me again. My relationship grew in toxicity until we split.

This past year alone and unemployed was the time of my life, exploring my passions. But i was constantly numbing my phobias and got into debt of course.

I recently re-enrolled in college, and met with a career center. The problem is, I don't want to go to school or work for a greedy company. I just want to prove my worth to society, so people deem me worthy of trust. I understand that school and work are ways to prove to people that I am capable and trustworthy, but I see the way it drives lonely people like me into addiction. 

I have no friends, none. I have loving parents, but don't speak to or trust anyone in my family. I can't imagine having the energy to push through the next 5-10 years of my life, grinding school and work, all while being completely desperate for someone to need me socially the way I need them.

I was excited to get back in classrooms starting January, but the darkness of living alone, trying to stay sober and build my future got too heavy. It's now looking like I'll have to move back in with my parents and start from scratch. 

I feel like the best thing for my future would be to push through my current paranoia, and challenge myself to build a busy schedule, stick to it and force growth. 

This week I either have to declare a major and start setting up a support system, or give up and move out. If I move out, I'll have more access to a network of doctors that can help me with my phobias and attachment issues. But maybe living with my parents for free is just a way for me to hide from the fact that I'm terrified to work. I can't trust myself psychological or physically to hold up for 40 hours a week- and I've already had a public breakdown that could have tarnished my reputation more than I know. 

Anywhere i ask, I get different advice. Follow your passions, go to film school. Get on a path to economic stability with a STEM degree. Work a min wage job. Go to rehab. 

I just have no idea how I'll accomplish anything without any human connections. Seems like most happy people have these beautiful relationships within their family, hometown or college friends. Or at least, gets a door opened by a connection somewhere along the line. I have horrible relations with everyone I've ever met. 

I am trying so hard to put out the fires in my life, but near giving up and just admitting that I'm not cut out for the things I want. I shouldn't even bother challenging myself because I am a broken human that breaks things around me.",213,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1fsdyux/my_life_at_27_is_up_in_flames/,1727641819.0,throw77_away,1fsdyux,advice_seeking

I have tried every piece of advice that I could but the truth is I just need money. My parents gave me a deadline to get one and I fucking can't. I really really have tried. I've tried applying for customer service and even tried pivoting because my own degree seems worthless. Temp agencies won't even have me (Ik my education gets in the way since I'm told I'm too expensive, but even when I tell them I am broadly open to anything, I'm not capable of heavy labor since I don't have technical training which is all that's available.) I have put every penny into resume resources or professional development/upskilling, free or paid. 

Me: F23, 5 years experience varied from academic positions to customer service to human services. Double majored in same field. High GPA from a top 20 university. I have applied to over 2000 job applications since I can't even remember what month. Professional development in copywriting (no luck landing agencies or businesses since I started.) I happen to have a sewing machine but no fabric. I can't drive. From a poor major city so I'm wary if selling anything expensive or nonessential would help. I have considered flipping wooden furniture, but again, I'd have to consider I'd be selling where it's unfeasible to people.

I have tried and just need an answer--a real answer--not someone telling me it'll work out. It only makes me more anxious knowing all I can be given are platitudes. Thoughts and prayers won't help. Please just please give me an answer that I can't possibly fuck up because I quite simply don't have the time to keep staying where I'm at. (No, I will not do sex work or join the military.) Also I don't have paid experience in the trades nor am I certified (which would exclude me from operating heavy equipment). I landscaped with relatives as a kid, but it was all simple tasks, nothing that required a machine. Weather is rainy here lately. 

I do not have anyone to turn to. I was born into poverty. All my relatives are unreliable. 

I've basically become a hermit because of how bad being jobless has taken its toll on my MH. Yes, I've physically gone in person to look for work.

Entrepreneur,ask for a raise,"I spent $47k and 18 months building an ""AI startup."" Here's the brutal truth about why 90% of AI businesses are doomed.","**TL;DR:** Burned through $47k building an AI tool that 12 people use. Here's what the ""AI gold rush"" really looks like from the trenches, and why most AI startups are just expensive tech demos.

# The Setup (AKA How I Got Caught Up in the Hype)

18 months ago, I was a perfectly happy software consultant making decent money. Then ChatGPT happened, and suddenly everyone was an ""AI entrepreneur."" My LinkedIn feed was nothing but:

* ""I built an AI that does X in 10 minutes!""
* ""Our AI startup just raised $2M!""
* ""$10k MRR with AI tools!""

I got FOMO and thought, ""How hard can it be?""

**Spoiler alert:** Very hard.

# The Idea (That Seemed Brilliant at 2 AM)

I decided to build an AI-powered content creation tool for small businesses. The pitch was simple: ""Input your business details, get professional marketing copy in seconds.""

Why this seemed genius:

* Small businesses suck at copywriting
* They don't want to hire expensive agencies
* AI can write decent copy
* Subscription model = recurring revenue

I spent weeks validating this idea by asking friends, ""Would you pay for this?"" Everyone said yes.

**First mistake:** Asking people what they'd pay for instead of asking them to actually pay for it.

# The Build (18 Months of ""Almost Done"")

**Months 1-3: The MVP That Wasn't Minimum** I started building what I thought was an MVP. Ended up with:

* Custom AI training pipeline
* Beautiful UI with 47 different templates
* User authentication system
* Payment processing
* Admin dashboard
* Analytics suite

Cost so far: $12k (mostly my own development time valued at $100/hour)

**Months 4-8: Feature Creep Hell** Beta users started asking for features:

* ""Can it write in different tones?""
* ""What about social media posts?""
* ""Can it integrate with WordPress?""
* ""What about email templates?""

I said yes to everything. Each feature took 2-3x longer than expected.

Cost so far: $28k

**Months 9-12: The Technical Debt Tsunami** Nothing worked together properly. The codebase was a nightmare. I spent 4 months just refactoring and fixing bugs.

Cost so far: $39k

**Months 13-18: Desperation Marketing** Launched on Product Hunt (ranked #47 for the day). Posted in Facebook groups. Cold emailed 500 small business owners. Tried Reddit ads, Google ads, LinkedIn outreach.

Total additional marketing spend: $8k Total users acquired: 73 Paying customers: 12

**Final tally: $47k spent, $340 revenue.**

# What I Got Wrong (Pretty Much Everything)

# 1. I Built a Solution Looking for a Problem

Small businesses don't actually want AI copywriting tools. They want customers. Big difference.

When I actually talked to my target market (should've done this first), here's what I learned:

* They're too busy to learn new tools
* They don't trust AI for their brand voice
* They'd rather hire their neighbor's kid for $50

# 2. I Competed with ChatGPT

Why would someone pay me $29/month when ChatGPT Plus is $20/month and does way more?

My value proposition was ""it's easier than ChatGPT.""

Reality: It wasn't. And even if it was 10% easier, that's not worth paying 45% more.

# 3. I Underestimated Sales & Marketing

I'm a developer. I thought ""build it and they will come"" was a real strategy.

Breakdown of my 18 months:

* Building: 14 months
* Marketing/Sales: 4 months

Should have been:

* Building: 4 months
* Marketing/Sales: 14 months

# 4. I Ignored Unit Economics Until Too Late

My customer acquisition cost: $650 per customer ($8k marketing spend ÷ 12 customers) My average revenue per customer: $28 (most churned after 1 month)

Even a business school dropout could see this math doesn't work.

# 5. I Built for Myself, Not Customers

I made assumptions about what small businesses wanted based on what I thought they should want.

Turns out, they just want more sales. They don't care how beautiful your UI is.

# The Real AI Business Landscape (It's Not Pretty)

After networking with other ""AI entrepreneurs"" for 18 months, here's what I've observed:

# Tier 1: The Actually Successful Ones (5%)

* Had domain expertise BEFORE AI
* Solved real problems for specific industries
* Focused on B2B with enterprise budgets
* Examples: AI for radiology, legal document review, financial compliance

# Tier 2: The Lifestyle Businesses (15%)

* Simple wrappers around OpenAI API
* Serve very specific niches
* Make $5k-20k/month
* Examples: AI email responder for dentists, AI job description generator

# Tier 3: The Strugglers (30%)

* Built cool tech demos
* Can't find paying customers
* Burning through savings/investor money
* This is where I lived

# Tier 4: The Delusional (50%)

* Think they're going to replace Google
* Have raised money based on PowerPoint slides
* Will be out of business within 2 years

# What Actually Works in AI Business

After talking to the successful Tier 1 and Tier 2 folks, here are the patterns:

# 1. Pick Boring Industries

The sexiest AI companies get all the attention and funding. But plumbing contractors also need software, and there's way less competition.

# 2. Charge Enterprise Prices

If you're saving a company 40 hours/week, charge them for 40 hours/week. Don't charge $29/month because that's what consumer apps cost.

# 3. Focus on Compliance/Risk Reduction

Companies will pay stupid money to avoid getting sued or fined. AI that helps with compliance is worth 10x more than AI that ""increases productivity.""

# 4. Become the Expert First

Learn an industry for 2-3 years BEFORE building AI for it. The AI part is easy. Understanding the problem is hard.

# My Pivot Strategy (What I'm Doing Now)

I'm not giving up on entrepreneurship, but I'm definitely giving up on AI for now.

**New approach:**

1. Pick an industry where I have connections (web development agencies)
2. Identify a specific, expensive problem ($10k+ problem)
3. Build the simplest possible solution (no AI needed)
4. Charge properly ($500-2000/month, not $29/month)
5. Get 10 paying customers before building anything fancy

**The business:** Project management tool specifically for web dev agencies that integrates with their existing stack and automates client reporting.

No AI. No fancy features. Just solving one expensive problem really well.

# Hard Truths About the AI Gold Rush

# Truth 1: Most AI Startups Are Just Expensive Consultants

If your business model is ""AI does the work faster,"" you're selling labor arbitrage, not technology. That's a consulting business with extra steps.

# Truth 2: OpenAI/Google Will Eat Your Lunch

If your competitive advantage is ""we fine-tuned GPT for X,"" you don't have a competitive advantage. You have a 6-month head start, max.

# Truth 3: Customers Don't Care About Your Technology

They care about outcomes. ""AI-powered"" is not a benefit. ""Saves you 10 hours per week"" is a benefit.

# Truth 4: The Technical Barriers Are Lower Than Ever

Building AI products is easier than it's ever been. Which means everyone's doing it. Which means you need actual business advantages, not just technical ones.

# What I Wish Someone Had Told Me

1. **Start with the market, not the technology.** Find people with expensive problems first. Then figure out how to solve them.
2. **B2B > B2C for AI.** Businesses have money and understand ROI. Consumers just want free stuff.
3. **Niche down relentlessly.** ""AI for small businesses"" is not a niche. ""AI for orthodontist appointment scheduling"" is a niche.
4. **Test with money, not words.** Don't ask if people would pay. Ask them to pay.
5. **Budget 3x longer than you think.** Everything in AI takes longer because the technology is still figuring itself out.

# The Question Everyone's Asking

""Should I still start an AI business?""

**My answer:** Only if you have deep domain expertise in a specific industry, access to that industry's decision-makers, and a problem that costs companies $100k+ per year.

If your plan is ""build cool AI thing, figure out customers later,"" just save yourself the time and money. Buy index funds instead.

# Final Thoughts

I don't regret this experience. I learned more about business in 18 months than I did in 5 years of consulting. But I definitely could have learned it for a lot less than $47k.

The AI opportunity is real, but it's not what the Twitter influencers are selling you. It's not about building the next ChatGPT wrapper. It's about understanding specific industries so well that you can apply AI to solve their most expensive problems.

Most of us (myself included) jumped on AI because the technology was exciting. But technology doesn't build businesses. Understanding customer problems builds businesses.

The gold rush mentality is exactly what's wrong with entrepreneurship right now. Everyone's looking for the quick win, the magic bullet, the secret hack.

There isn't one. There's just doing the boring work of understanding customers and solving their problems.

Entrepreneur,ask for a raise,"Stay as far away from Steak and Shake “owner” opportunity, as humanly possible.","Back in early 2024, I was approached with an “amazing investment opportunity” to become a franchise owner of a local Steak and Shake franchise. They sold it to me as similar to the revenue sharing structure of Chick-fil-A. For only a $10,000 investment, I can become the owner, and take home half of the annual profits from the store. On average, they said it should be in the $120k range to start, and only more as you build your customer base. 

The store I was taking over was a complete disaster. They had no GM. Only three employees. They hadn’t had a landscaper in over a year. The paint was peeled off half the property. There was a leak in the roof. The parking lot looked like a war zone. 

The biggest issue this store was facing was that most locals didn’t even know they were still in business. 

When I met with the brass; I said in explicit terms, that’d I’d only take this on if corporate was going to partner with me to get the place at least back to looking like it was open. They agreed. I paid my $10k fee, and took over. 

The literal first week, I come to find out that the former manager had promised pay raises for two of the three employees who had both been there 10+ years. They showed me the receipts. I brought it to my area manager. He said that was the old person, so it didn’t mean anything now. Red flag #1. 

Next, I asked if they had an existing landscaping company, and they said no that I could find one. So I did. A good friend has a lawn care business. Gave me a stupid cheap deal. After his first two cuts, he hadn’t been paid by corporate. Red flag #2. 

I then asked if we could get the parking lot taken care of, because it looked like a war zone. I also said that the roof needed repaired because every time it rained; the kitchen flooded if there wasn’t a bucket down. Not only that, but that water was 100% in food prep areas. 

The answer I got was “we can’t do that for you right now. We need to see sales at $xxx before we can approve any work. Also, you can only have yourself and two others working right now”. Red flag factory. 

 The final straw for me was on a Sunday it was just myself and a grill guy running the whole show. He was off at 5 and the two people, including the manager I inherited, no call no showed. When I called my regional manager, he said “no worries just lock the front door and run drive thru by yourself through dinner”. 

I kindly told him to fuck off. And walked out the front door. 

Turns out, I was the fifth or sixth person they’d done the same thing too. And keep in mind during your six to eight month probation period you DONT GET PAID. so I spent two months, basically ***paying them $10,000*** to run their store. 

I don’t know if this is happening all over the place, or if I just got lucky. I do know the regional manager and local managers I was working with both left the company on their own because of the shit show it was. 

So, in conclusion, if you see this “opportunity” come across your desk, run the other way as fast as possible. ",838,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1lwmfzx/stay_as_far_away_from_steak_and_shake_owner/,1752177327.0,Glittering_Mud3643,1lwmfzx,advice_seeking

20 interviews. 
0 offers. 

Often I am told I am too skilled for the role. The role would bore me, etc. 

I’d like to just get a job and work the hours. 

No one wants to hire me. 

It’s miserable. I can close a sale, market and grow a product, hire the right people, raise money. 

So. Be warned. It’s lame being 40s, paper rich/dollar poor, no insurance, no local colleages (remote work), no work relationships (remote), and no prospects. 

Also, be careful about not bragging about your wins and letting your employees take the credit for minor roles. 2 of my CXOs were picked up for being the brains behind the operation. I congratulated them, but now, I realize my humble approach on LinkedIn kept everyone happy when I employed them, but did no favors for me once we sold. 

And befor you ask how I’m broke with 8figs, acquiring company did some lovely things before I vested, and, my family VC diluted my shares by installing a son in law to take out loans from VC for stupid shit the business didn’t need. Most the time 1m loans weren’t even done via a board meeting.

Entrepreneur,ask for a raise,Leveraging Google's Trust With Links: Grow Your Business and Website By Getting It Right,"Growing a website is part of the entrepreneurial journey. I’ve seen a huge amount of false information pertaining to link building/acquisition and how they interact with website growth, and how they force Google to perceive your site in different ways. The reality is that the largest online businesses you can think of invest heavily in link building, they all do it. But you can too - and there are things you can do to help your website and business get to the next level and compete for some hard to hit keywords. 

Here are some strategies and tips I’ve used for small, medium and large businesses to help them capture some commercial and high volume keywords - as well as general link building advice that can help Google look upon your site in a more favourable way. It’ll either help you do a better job of it yourself, or hold the agency you use to a higher standard.

That’s what link building is all about - doing something that shows Google that other sites trust you. If other sites (Good sites) trust you (sites that google already trust) then logically Google should trust you too, right? That’s all it is but people get it so wrong when in reality its an incredibly logical (though time intensive) process. If you can convince Google to trust your website then you’ll rank for more keywords, higher for currently ranked keywords, higher for more commercial keywords, and in general Google will send more of the right, relevant traffic your way.

# Website Traffic: Quality over Quantity

If you want Google to trust your website more, and show it to more people searching for commercial terms relevant to what you’re selling/offering - then logically it needs to trust the sites that link to you - that’s what this is all about and what will help you rank higher. If google sees trusted websites linking to you - it’ll raise your profile - but how can you evaluate whether google trusts a website?

Web traffic is a main website assessment metric. However, a lot of people use it in the wrong way. Most people now know (not all) that focusing on DA/DR etc. as a way to assess a website is a one way ticket to at best, a link that does nothing and a quick way to burn through your cash. So, we look at site traffic instead. We often consult on external link campaigns, on one, a client was approving any links (from their internal marketing team) with traffic over 5k - that was their only barometer, traffic over 5k. There are multiple things wrong here.

* The traffic might be coming from a country that the client business doesn’t even operate in. 
* The traffic might be coming from completely fake/nonsense sources
* The keywords the site ranks for might also be complete nonsense (meaning the traffic means nothing or is just fake and spoofed).

So - instead of focusing on traffic numbers - focus on where the traffic is coming from. Instead of looking at quantity, go for quality. Here - we taught the team to look at what the site is ranking for, and whether or not they’re relevant in the grand scheme of the campaign. By focusing on this instead of the blind numbers, they’re not only getting websites that rank for relevant terms to link to them, but sites with real traffic. In this case - a site with 2k relevant and real traffic is better than one with 50k nonsense anyday! 

Numbers can be good if you’re assessing two sites with real traffic against each other - obviously then, if you’ve the budget, you go for the larger one as seemingly Google is passing that one more (relevant) traffic (for whatever reason). 

A good agency/link builder will be able to build you a profile of beneficial and natural links while taking all this into account. Google needs to not only trust the site you want a link from, but to trust it for the right reasons.

# Don’t Just Settle For A Link

This is something I do for my clients and it's something you can do quite easily too. 

When you approach a site and agree a price for a link placement, don’t just leave it there. You can usually negotiate some extra elements that will give your link a bit more power (whether submitting content or using a link insert). 

Make sure to ask the website owner to clarify:

* If the cost includes the link being live for the lifetime of the site (some site owners may only leave it live for a specific amount of time - depending on the time, it could be worthless meaning you place the link elsewhere)
* No other links to be inserted into your content (at least no other commercial or competitive links) once it's live
* To request indexing in GSC manually
* To internally link to the page from a few other pages - choose these yourself and make sure you choose pages that actually already rank
* No affiliate links to be inserted into your content by site owner
* Do they own any other website that they could use to link to the new content too

There are other things you could ask depending on the situation/website and your business - but those should ensure you extract more from your placement and better bang for your buck.

# Don’t Push Them All To The Same Place

One of the mistakes a lot of businesses (and indeed agencies) make with this is pushing all the links to the same place - usually this is the homepage. 

However - Google rank pages! They don’t rank websites (they rank websites on whole, but its the individual pages that google will rank, that’s why, for example, some sites have certain pages ranked and indexed, while other pages aren’t).

Pushing links to the homepage is a great idea when used as part of a wider strategy. That’s to say for example if you’re an accounting firm and you have a page dedicated to a business advisory service there’s no point pushing links to the homepage for the business advisory service, these should go to the service page.

However - on the other side of this, you can’t send them ALL there (unless you’re already ranking very strongly). You need to be diverse. In this case, you’d send some to your homepage and some to the page you want to rank for the commercial term. 

Links to your homepage lead Google to trust your site as a whole - links to a direct service/product page leads Google to trust that page - it can be hard to have one without the other. Don’t throw them all into the same page - mix it up. It works so much better, evenly, and the results will last long term. If you throw them all to the same page it looks unnatural - this is especially the case if the page was previously not ranking.

# Contextualise The Content

Always place links in unique content that has been written for the website it’s being placed on. You can then, in a nuanced way, contextualise the keyword (link placement) by talking about the industry or business type without being overly promotional. It sounds a bit technical, but it’s really easy when you get the hang of it. Just remember:

1. The contextualisation cannot occur in a promotional way
2. The content has to be relevant for the website AND the link (80% website, 20% link)

Context contextualisation is one of the most critical parts of link building. Links placed inside good, unique and relevant content will always do well, but if you can contextualise the content around the link it’ll do much better and you’ll get even more power from it. It’s why curating the content is so important.

Its something a lot of businesses, when building links for themselves, don’t do right (and a load of agencies too) - you/they will end up creating links that look overly promotional or a bit stilted.

To gain googles trust, and to rank higher for keywords and pull more relevant traffic in, you need to make it appear that people are linking to you in an off hand and genuinely suggestive way.

# Don’t Go All In On Link Inserts

This one depends on the situation, as most - but there is still a troubling pattern emerging with link inserts in the wider business. Many businesses or link building/seo agencies use link inserts - where you insert the link into an existing bit of content/page rather than create new content and a new page. It can work well - but if not done right/well its completely ineffectual and won’t help Google convey any trust upon your page/website.

Best way to illustrate this is by looking at what I saw with a client and what they’d been doing.

For this client, they’d been using link inserts for a long period of time with mixed results. Every now and then they’d get a small bump followed by a retraction. The strategy just wasn’t working. One of the issues was that, as a large B2B machinery seller in the financial sector, the weak link inserts previously procured just weren't moving the needle for the more difficult keywords. Before we look at the strategy - I just wanted to run through link inserts in a bit more detail…

They’ve always been a cheaper option - and can sometimes be effective. However, there’s a way to get the best out of them. A way that the majority of large “link building agencies” don’t use or really care about due to the volume they’re processing. Unfortunately, its led to misinformation in general about what works best for link inserts.

I find the best way to look at them is in a kind of tier system. This is just something that's in my own head, but it might help you out. Remember, link inserts, in my opinion, rarely beat post placements because with a post, you can completely control the breadth of content that sits around the link, allowing you to get the best from it entirely. With a link insert, the content isn’t primed to drive your link in the best possible way. Anyway:

Tier one: A link that's thrown into content that isn’t even indexed on google.

In our opinion these are the lowest of the low (though some might think otherwise) - and usually what these agencies procure on mass for their clients (or other agencies outsourcing to them). Doesn’t matter if the website is decent, if the page the link is in isn’t indexed, it’s going to do near nothing! 

If you’re procuring a link insert yourself - check the content you want it inserted into is at least indexed on google! You can do this with a simple site:(webpage) search on google itself. 

In the case above, upon investigation, these were mainly the links procured for the client up until we started working together.

Tier two: A link in a page that’s indexed

Its better because its indexed. However, here you have to make sure the content is worthwhile, isn’t terrible, and ties in with your own link. 

You don’t just want to throw your link into a page just because its indexed. Sure, you might be able to reword some of it, and potentially add in a paragraph that surrounds the link - but it has to be contextually relevant to what the link leads to. 

The client had a few of these too, some moderately relevant, but no consistency. 

Tier three: a link in content that ranks on google

Now we’re getting somewhere. The content actually ranks on google - it isn’t just indexed…its ranked for terms. This means google is passing the content/page value…its saying that essentially it trusts the page enough to show it to people. A link here is clearly more valuable than the above. Again - the content has to be on point, and you can’t just throw your link into any content…there has to be relevancy. With that said - a link in content that ranks, if done right, will usually pull.

The client had none of these…

Tier four: A link in content that ranks for industry specific keywords

These are great, because the keywords are completely related to you, and to what you do. Difficult to get, but completely worthwhile.

Tier five: A link in content that ranks for what you’re trying to rank for

A holy grail - but usually out of reach. These work incredibly well usually - but most sites aren’t going to link to a competitor from a page that ranks for a keyword they’re trying to beat them in - but it can be done in certain niches and situations. 

Remember - the content also has to be right when you’re looking at link inserts, this is just illustrative of the different kinds out there without really looking at assessing the website or content - its a way of highlighting how you can leverage getting a good link insert out of your provider.

Most bought are tier 1 - a good agency won’t get you these kind of inserts (a great one will use inserts sparingly anyway - instead curating content that gives your link the best chance of doing well) - but this gives you an idea of how to leverage something out of it if buying them for yourself or assessing a provider.

Now - back to the client, they sell large machinery with some pretty tough keywords to crack. The agencies previously primarily were using tier one and two above…so no real efficacy, on pages with weak relevancy.

By pivoting to content curation, we were able to write for the target website while really making the most out of the link in the content we’ve written. We focused down on websites in the B2B niche as well as websites within the niches that would use this kind of software - the link inserts previously were just slapped into any kind of weakly relevant content. Remember, with link inserts, the content has been written for another purpose (maybe even for another link) - so you’re usually better off putting content together. The differentiation here got them where they wanted to be within 4 months, and when you think they’d spent years building crappy link inserts it speaks volumes.

The main takeaway here is you can’t cut corners. You either need to get GOOD link inserts, or curate the content yourselves and you’ll see results if consistent. It boils down to logic. It also kind of shows how so many do this wrong (either due to lack of knowledge, or because they just can’t be bothered to do it right). 

Don’t just slap your links into any kind of content - Pivot to placing content written to support your link.

Mix Up The Keywords: But Don’t Be Afraid To Go After The Harder Ones

# Create A New Linkable Asset

You check the competition and make sure what you’re trying to rank is better than what they’re trying to rank…it’s the first thing you do. So, the content reads better, is longer (where needed, quality over quantity), page is faster etc…sometimes that isn’t enough.

In competitive niches you know your competitors will have top quality content that you can only match. Sometimes you’ve got to think outside the box to make a dent, especially if you’re new to the scene.

In this case, we created a calculator as a content break, then used links to rank the content that was built around the calculator. We made the content far more useful to the reader because it now included an interactive calculator. So, when we began the link building it worked a lot better and was more logical…because bloggers, website owners etc. would logically link to the content that was better.

So, by creating a new linkable asset within the content we created a unique and specific angle.

This was predictably in the law/finance niche. The volume was very low but the difficulty was hard. The search intent was incredibly commercial and the kw led to clients that garnered eye watering payouts…if that makes sense. Point being, they’d previously ranked in the top three, and dropped to around 15. By adding links and the calculator, over four months they’re now consistently fighting for 1.

Point being: have a look at the content breaks your competitors are using/not using and one up them with something unique. Then, when you go for a link building campaign you’ll pull more traction. I’ve seen this work elsewhere too but this is the most recent and applies to the “2023” moniker. It can be something as simple as some well placed infographics, unique pictures, data tables, etc. In our case, they’d already been used by competitors so we had to get a dev to create a calculator. Just saying, it doesn’t always have to be a calculator

If you’ve got a trusted calculator, or a content break thats different from other competitors, you can create an angle of attack in harder industries that can help raise your sites profile once combined with links to said content break. 

# Using An Agency? Find one that offers traffic and ranking increase - not just links. 

This should also apply to you if you’re doing it yourself. Think and formulate a strategy that will garner ranking increase and more traffic - not a strategy that just blindly acquires links. The majority of agencies out there, if you buy a bunch of links or monthly services - will offer links of a certain DA/authority etc. That’s it - that’s their deliverable.

 Finding an agency that doesn’t look at that, but instead looks at increasing real and relevant traffic to your site and ranking you higher for chosen keywords is far better.

Remember, links aren’t there for the sake of it, they’re built to increase traffic and ranking for your website. If a provider is saying X amount gets X links of X DA - that’s done and finished. They’ve secured you the DA 50 links you paid for, what happens next is up to chance! Find an agency with case studies who can create a link profile that actually makes a difference to your site, not just vanity metric inducing links that don’t really do much at all. What’s their strategy regarding site placements, keywords, link targets and how are they going to use this to grow your site. They can never guarantee it happening over a certain time, but if they know their stuff they’ll be able to get their eventually - sometimes sooner rather than later.

# Do Links Still Work?

They’re an incredibly powerful ranking factor. There are other elements at play, as always, but if you get link creation right and you’re consistent, and go at it with a planned and logical approach you can raise the profile of your website in the eyes of google and they’ll send more of the right traffic your way = more sales/conversions. Its as simple as that. 

Go at it with a targeted keyword strategy, decent budget and target the right kinds of links and you’ll rank and compete for large keywords consistently. I’ve seen it work time and time again, I’ve seen smaller sites beat larger/more established ones - it just takes patience and the right approach.

Most get it wrong because they don’t do their research first before doing their own link building campaign, OR, they hire an agency that just slam links anywhere and don’t put a proper plan together.

Good luck!

Entrepreneur,ask for a raise,"$30,000 in 4 months of E-commerce.","Taking the Leap: My Journey from a High-Paying Job to Full-Time E-Commerce.

Hey everyone,

I'm a 30-year-old from Australia, and I recently launched my e-commerce store on Shopify back in May 2024, selling my own products. About 18 months ago, I had an idea that sparked this journey, and since then, I've been grinding hard to set up my company. From raising capital and bringing on co-founders to securing contract manufacturers and building a website, I've put in the work. Fast forward to today, and I'm proud to say we've done $4,000 in organic sales within our first month and have been growing steadily ever since. Our ROAS is sitting at 3:1, we have recurring customers, great reviews, an average order value of $102, and a 19% returning customer rate. It’s been an exciting ride with some great early achievements.

Now, I’m not here to brag. Four months in, and $30,000 isn’t a huge payday by any means. I'm still not taking a salary, and the company still owes me for my initial startup capital. Yes, we've had a promising start and have managed to create a good amount of profit out of that 30k, but we haven’t yet faced the major challenges that every business inevitably encounters. We're not a seasonal brand, but like any other business, we're susceptible to external factors, economic downturns and other hardships that business face.

So, why am I posting this? I recently asked the entrepreneur community for advice on whether I should quit my high-paying job to focus on my e-commerce business full-time. Right now, I’m working 62.5 hours over five days (with night shifts thrown in) and spending an extra 10 hours commuting. That’s a lot of time, and it’s exhausting. Trying to scale and grow my e-commerce business while balancing this workload is burning me out, and I’m finding it hard to enjoy life outside of work, alongside looking after my health and well-being.

From my previous post in the entrepreneur community on Reddit, A lot of people advised me to keep my day job and run my company on the side or at least try to reduce my hours if possible. It’s solid advice. But, I’ve decided to say, “F**k it.” My happiness, sleep, and health are more important. And so is the opportunity to scale my e-commerce business with the extra time I’d gain from leaving my job.

So, I’ve made my decision: at the end of this year, I’m going to take a leap of faith. I’m quitting my job to prioritize my happiness, health, and side hustle. I have the skills to find a similar job with comparable pay if things don’t work out (although I’ll make sure I make it work out!), so I’m not afraid of the risk—I’m more afraid of wasting my life.

Here’s my plan: I’m saving up as much as I can between now and January. I’ve got enough frequent flyer points to get me to Bali, Indonesia, for free and back (a few times), so I’m planning to head there, enjoy the surf, eat good food, take advantage of the low cost of living, meet new people, and most importantly, network with other entrepreneurs.

I’m considering starting a vlog to document this journey, sharing my progress, and hopefully inspiring other entrepreneurs who want to take a similar leap. This won’t be about living the luxury life of a millionaire (which I am far from)—it's about showing the real risks I'm taking in real-time and whether I make it out on top. It could be a short-lived vlog if I end up back in Australia working again, but with my drive, I’m determined to make it work. I want to show others not just how to transition to a more fulfilling life, but also how to grow a business from the ground up, including all the hardships people often leave out of their success stories.
This won’t be a “I’ve got a heap of money and living in luxury, watch me” type of Vlog, this will hopefully be a rag to riches, or more importantly, how to increase your happiness and lifestyle by taking a leap of faith.

Just putting this out there for some food for thought. I’d love to hear what you all think.

Entrepreneur,negotiate salary,Any CEO who doesn't give the founding developers in his startip equity is pure evil,"I was talking to this old big shot CEO about joining as a cofounder on the gtm side but then he told me that he structured his startup (5people) in which the ""techie"" doesn't get equity at all!!!!

What an asshole.

I immediately stopped talking to him. Anyone who thinks of a founding dev as ""techie"" and gives him 0 equity is a personal enemy of mine. Idc if that dev is 16 years old and just learned the basics of js, and I don't care if he is earning a salary. Giving the only tech person on the team 0% equity is a HUGEEE red flag that no experienced founder should do or tolerate. It means you are looking down on the tech side itself, and its definitely not fair to the devs who usually are not as good at negotiation.

Entrepreneur,negotiate salary,My Father Tricked Me Out of My Share in Our Business,"A year ago, I started a business with my father and his partner. We had a clear agreement about how the ownership would be split: I would get 25% since I was putting in 30% of the capital, and his partner would get 15% for handling marketing, even though he wasn’t investing any money. The rest went to my dad.

At first, things were going great. We were all working together, and everything seemed smooth. But soon, the partner started slacking off. He stopped showing up to meetings, wasn’t doing any of the marketing he was supposed to handle, and just wasn’t involved at all. It got to the point where we needed his signature to open a business bank account, but he refused to cooperate. Eventually, we paid him to leave the business just to move forward without him.

After he was gone, it was just me and my dad running the show. We made a new agreement where I was supposed to get 45% of the company, since I’d be taking on more responsibilities—managing the marketing, overseeing employees, and even training them. It was a big step up from what I had been doing before. But when it came time to sign the papers, I noticed that instead of the 45% we had agreed on, my dad only gave me 15%. I confronted him about it, and he assured me that he’d fix it later but asked me to sign for now so we could deal with the bank.

I should mention that my dad is married to another woman, and she’s been a constant drain on him financially. That’s part of the reason I pushed for the 45%—to protect my investment and ensure I had a solid stake in the company for the work I was putting in. But after I signed, he kept stalling. For months, he told me he was working on getting the documents sorted, but nothing changed. He stopped including me in key decisions, didn’t pay me a salary or share profits, and used company money for his own personal expenses. Whenever I tried to bring this up, it turned into an argument.

Fast forward to today—things reached a breaking point. I found a new supplier that I wanted to work with, and I told my dad I’d take full responsibility for the sales, shipping, and marketing. I even paid for the marketing campaign with my own money. After a couple of days, the campaign was already working, and we had some solid sales lined up. Then, out of nowhere, my dad tells me we have to cancel everything because another business connected to the supplier called him, complaining that our prices were undercutting theirs.

Mind you, I was handling everything, and I was ready to cover the costs of inventory and marketing myself. But he insisted we drop the supplier and shut everything down. We got into a massive argument, and I told him I wanted out of the company and my money back. He flat-out refused and isn’t willing to repay what I’ve put into the business.

So here I am—after a year of putting my heart, soul, and money into this business, my dad has completely sidelined me, refuses to fix the ownership split, and won’t return my investment. I don’t know what to do next. Do I take legal action? Try to negotiate one last time? I’m feeling lost, frustrated, and betrayed.

Has anyone been through something similar, or have any advice on what steps I


UPDATE 

For some more context on the situation with my dad and the business: the reason he decided to drop the new supplier I brought in was because one of our competitors  vendors, who also works with the new supplier, was upset that the marketing campaign I launched had prices lower than what he was selling for. He felt like we were undercutting him and losing him sales.

Since my dad handles most of the customer inquiries, this vendor got in touch with him directly and was really aggressive, basically telling my dad to stop the campaign and raise our prices. I told my dad that it’s none of this guy’s business how much we sell for or profit from—it’s our business, not his.

To be clear, the lower price I set wasn’t permanent; it was just a tester to see how the market would respond. And, to top it off, the new supplier didn’t care at all what price we sold at—they were totally fine with it. But instead of talking things through with me, my dad decided, on his own, to drop the new supplier altogether. He didn’t want to deal with them even thought I was the one who was going to buy the new inventory with my own savings and do all the work for the new supplier my self cause I was sick of him sucking up the company revenue for his personal use so I decided to take care of this new supplier and handle all the finances and revenues myself on a separate account to keep the business going  so he might felt his little piggy bank will get effected , and he highlighted he didn’t like the way the guy from the other vendor talked to him, so he just made the call to cut ties with the new supplier, even though I had already invested my time and money into making it work.

The frustrating part is, the vendor my dad wants to stick with has been unreliable for over a month. They’ve had major supply shortages and haven’t given us anything in weeks. We’ve been stuck with no product and lots of delayed delivery’s and canceled orders cause of the delays  , and I found a solution to keep the business moving forward by bringing in this new supplier. But instead of appreciating that, my dad just shut it down, without a valid reason.

We’re supposed to be partners, and yet he’s making these big decisions on his own, based on how someone talked to him, rather than what’s best for the business. I’m honestly at a loss here. I tried to step up and save us from the supply issues, but he’s making it impossible to move forward.",77,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1ffi9fn/my_father_tricked_me_out_of_my_share_in_our/,1726188847.0,Luckyswordfishcunt,1ffi9fn,advice_seeking
Entrepreneur,negotiate salary,"""Entrepreneurship is not for everyone"" I'm down to my last 1k, where do I go from here?","# Before I explain how I ended up with 1k left in my personal savings.

*Let me start by sharing how I ended up as a broke startup entrepreneur from a failed call center agent.*

After graduating from college my first taste of the real world started after being let go from **a call center job** barely surviving **the training phase for only 2 months** but **being compensated for it**. 

I was released with **no plan, no backup, a little bit of money and no ambition**.

I somehow turned to podcasting as my outlet, created my show and met a handful of creators.

* **Venture 1 (Failed)**

With the small network of people I met online during the pandemic, I had a **random spark moment** where I decided to start a small podcast network with no background on how to run a podcast network. 

We ran our network more like a production house instead of a network by producing our own type of content **over the past 4 years**, although we had a couple of advertisers, the main person in charge was not me. **(*****From my perspective, I was not confident in my ability to solve problems yet, because I was also trying to find my means of survival after having been let go from the call center)***

* **Venture 2 (Failed)**

After 4 years, we decided to fold our podcast network, 

My comrades and I decided to focus on **media production**, mainly on **educational content**. Again, an unexpected event happened that stopped us from moving forward, although we had built a good momentum for a couple of months.

**We had no choice, but we decided to shelf this project.**

* **Venture 3 (Success)**

After reflecting on my past failed ventures, as I sent my resumes left and right, hoping to be employed. I decided to revive a **podcast mentorship project** I made with a friend I met from the US, focusing more on helping others grow podcasts.

One thing led to the other. I created my own podcast content, hoping to get some traction, but I had no direction. **(Another epic fail here)**

***As I was about to shoot this dream down again.***

Then I saw an opportunity, and I decided to pivot this project to that direction! **Instead of mentoring as the primary source**, why not take what my past 2 failed ventures taught me already and go from there, **which is low cost podcast production.**

***Year one 2025, we have been profitable with small revenue coming in, but after years of failing. I am glad this is working out FINALLY. I do intend to get back the dream of building my podcast network again through this venture, but I should take every waking day one day at a time.***

*So, with my entrepreneurial story out of the way,* 

# How did I end up having 1k in my savings, you ask!

Of course, during the entire journey of my entrepreneurial ventures, I managed to secure a couple of work-from-home jobs here and there, **so saving, allocating and budgeting became a skill I needed to learn quick, but after I got my credit card**, I decided to upgrade the tools I've been using for my 3^(rd) Venture and my current part time.

With minimal disclosure, my last salary from my part-time and remaining savings got me up to 29k, as my credit card bill was close to 28k. 

**I cleared it, and ended up down to my last 1k.**

**Reckless? Not really, because every single penny I spend was 95% mostly for my working tools & 5% we're personal!**

**Scared? Maybe, but not that much!**

**Lesson here to learn,** *before starting a venture, learn your fundamentals and learn them quickly.* 

*These are things that are not taught in school:*

1. **Saving**
2. **Allocating**
3. **Budgeting** 
4. **Tracking money via Google Sheets or Excel**
5. **Negotiating**
6. **Selling**
7. **Mindset**
8. **Commando strategic thinking - Ability to think when you have nothing on your back.**

**Entrepreneurship is more than just an emotional roller coaster, logic is the buckle that ensures that you stay safe in the roller coaster while enjoying the journey even longer.**

*If you are also going through the same thing, more power to you!* **Stay strong!** 

**Additional Note;**

Through the years of being an on-and-off employee, I learned that maybe there is something more to this life than chasing another paycheck. 

**My gut was right!**

I am not happy being someone else's pet, building their dreams while my own won't even exist on earth. 

If you feel the same way and you know you are on to something, but you don't know what it is yet.

Never be afraid to try things, **passion is overrated, having your own purpose in life gets you to heights beyond your imagination.**

Entrepreneur,negotiate salary,"Unexpected discovery: Why the women in our team outperform across sales, strategy, and burnout resistance","So I run a remote company that's been growing pretty fast  we've brought on over 100 people in the last 3 years across sales, marketing, ops, support, the whole thing.

A few months back I started noticing something weird, and once I started paying attention I couldn't unsee it.

It wasn't intentional at all, but here's what we're seeing: some of our absolute best performers in marketing and sales happen to be women. And I mean really outperforming  they're taking way less PTO, seem less burned out, and honestly just come at problems with these creative, super organized approaches that blow me away.

But here's the kicker  in salary negotiations, the guys are routinely asking for 15-25% more than the women. Yet the women are often the ones crushing it once they're actually on the team.

And honestly? It's making me think we might be part of the gender wage gap problem without even realizing it. Like, if someone asks for $80k and crushes every metric, while someone else asks for $100k and performs worse... we're essentially paying less for better work. That feels backwards and unfair.

Look, we've hired some amazing men too, I'm not trying to paint with a broad brush here. But the pattern is strong enough that it's got me wondering if we're screwing this up somehow.

Are we accidentally perpetuating wage gaps just because we go with what people ask for? Should we be proactively offering more to people who undervalue themselves? Maybe we need to just post salary ranges upfront so this negotiation dance doesn't happen at all?

Has anyone else noticed stuff like this? I'm genuinely curious what other founders are seeing because this caught us completely off guard, and now I'm wondering how many other companies are unknowingly contributing to these disparities.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1lce8zt/unexpected_discovery_why_the_women_in_our_team/,1750030392.0,VirtualSoftCloud_,1lce8zt,advice_seeking
Entrepreneur,negotiate salary,From Housekeeper to House Manager - Writing a Business Plan/Proposal,"I started housekeeping as a side hustle in May. Business was good in May, incredible in June, started to dropped off in July, and is looking abysmal this month. 

One of my clients I started with in June adores my work and called me today to tell me she wants me as a house manager for her and her parents. She said to give her a number that will make the work worth my time, full time pay for part time hours, and we can start negotiating/discussing it. 

She said she wanted me 6 days a week, 52 weeks a year if she can have me, which doesn’t work for me as a mom of 3 so I’m going to offer 5 days a week and request some flexibility around holidays and school days off. I do have childcare for vacations both holiday and summer. 

She will be doing a 1099, paying a weekly salary, and offering all basic vehicle maintenance since she owns many vehicle based franchises and the position does involve 10 hours of travel a week.

I’m currently writing a business plan/proposal to go over my proposed salary, with included vehicle maintenance and assigned duties, hours, and expectations. I’m going in with a higher salary in my proposal than I’m expecting her to agree to but not significantly higher than I’m expecting, I just wanted negotiation room. 

We also discussed a 90 day trial period to make sure it works for us both. I’m going to ask to retain my 3 current housekeeping clients (2 days a month) during that time so that if this doesn’t work, I’m not starting from scratch after the trial period. I also need a brake change, probably yesterday, so I’d like to ask for that as a sign on bonus if it doesn’t sound unreasonable, which I think it isn’t based on my conversation with her today. She is incredibly kind and generous and sounds like she really wants to make this work for us both. 

I have a notebook full of notes but I’m not really sure how to write out this plan/proposal. Am I missing any details? I’ve done a ton of research into the numbers I’m proposing and why they make sense but I’m not sure if explaining them is appropriate? I’d love feedback on the best way to do this and go from side hustle to business, if that’s what this is.

Entrepreneur,negotiate salary,Entry #11: Jojo's Cafe. How to buy a Shitty Cafe.,"Sales: $9,000.00  
Expense: $6,000.00  
Net Profit; $1,500.00  
Hours worked: 130 hours

well..my parents told me to close the shop for the rest of the month to restructure. So let's talk about something else this month. I’ll try to write some questions people ask this month and list it here so it doesn’t get kept asked in the DM. 

**Are you gonna take legal action against the shop?**

No, that would serve no purpose. you don’t sue to win, you sue to get money. Nothing good can come out of this situation. As Koreans say, “ you avoid shit b/c it's dirty, not because it's dangerous.”  

**Is there a specific reason why he’s not willing to help?**

Boba boss’ main speciality is to grow and sell it. So let's say you can sell the company for 3x the sales. If all of his shops sell $100 a year. He can get $300 per store. But my shop only performs $50 a year, then he can only get $150 instead of $300. So he no longer wants anything to do with us. (Not paying franchise fee or the royalty didn’t really help the cause either.)

**What are you going to do now?** 

As always, I will do my best till the very end. My parents were furious at how this turned out but as for me, I'm going to keep at it. I do have some of their stocks for 2-3 months, so I’ll just use those and later change to a new design. 

**Jojo. I like your stories, any interest in taking it further and making youtube or etc.**

No. The last thing the world needs is a half baked newsletter, e-book, courses, youtuber, tiktoker. And I can only speak for myself but, remaining anonymous is one of the best things in this world. Considering how this boba shop turned around…i guess it was the right move.  

**Focus. A singular point**

I still haven’t figured out how to expand or find a good way to summarize things I learned. fThe Format of reddit makes it so easy to troll since I can’t write 100 pages to give examples, evidence, etc. So instead of the shotgun approach, I’ll try to make it more singular.

This month, I'll talk about what I get asked most about cafe shops. How do you buy one?   


—---------------------------------



**Whose advice is better? The doctor or the trainer?**

If I am getting surgery, I want the best doctor possible. If I was trying to lose weight, would I listen to the doctor or the trainer? I listen to the trainer even if his knowledge isn’t 100% scientific. Because I firmly believe the paper gap theory and those who have crossed the line know better even if it doesn’t make logical sense. The world doesn’t move through logic, but through emotions. 

I’ll discuss how to buy a turn key cafe (buying from someone else) rather than building from scratch. Because my experience is on turnkey cafe, not an empty key. My ideas have weight in the things I experience. I don’t know how much it is to set up a table,  lighting cost, or building it from scratch. I only talk about what I know .mSo here it goes. 

**How much should I pay for a cafe?**

google “cafe shop for sale” or go visit bizbullsell, loopnet, crexi etc…it will be listed like this

Asking Price: $280,000  
Gross Revenue:  $250,000

**How would you build a basketball team?** 

Why does it only list two factors? How do you calculate the margin? Expense? Cash flow? Profit? Ok. Since not everybody is versed in purchasing. I’ll describe it in a way that makes sense to everyone. 

Let's say you are building a local basketball team. You don’t have money to borrow a gym to test out everyone’s skill or the time to go through everyone and set up a phone interview, or visit their local gym to see them play. So what would be the fastest way to build a team? I would ask for height, weight, highest level you played. This isn’t the most optimal, but it would make sense right? 

I’m not saying if you didn’t play college, you are, or can be better than a college player, but if you have to bet based on what you know, it would be safer to bet on the college player right? 

It's the same principle. What matter is the asking price for obvious reason. And gross revenue. Which is pretty much “how much does the shop make”

**The numbers do not lie.** 

You can get into small details about how many employees, the operating hours, location, etc.. but the 1st number needs to make sense. If you are unwilling to pay more than $200,000.00 for a shop, you need to walk away. If you start fidgeting the number to change the reality of the situation, the risk gets too much. Its like when people say “I’ve failed every test so far, but if I can get 96 on the finals, I can still pass.” WRONG. You need to drop that course right now.  

Keep that in mind. Its not about potentials only you can see. You are a rookie, you are not going to fulfill the potential. And chances are ..saving up to $200k means your whole life savings. You have one shot. 

**The liquid sales are 30%**

Any business that deals with “liquids” is 30% profit. 

So for example, Gross Revenue listed as $250,000.00. Divide that by 12 months. It's about $20,833.33. 

So what's 30% of that? Its $6,250.00

So this shop is making $6,250.00 per month. Now when people talk about “margins”, what's the “profit” ? What is “EBDITA” are all secondary. A minor detail. Like asking a college player, how many points did you score, which college did you play. It matters, but given that they played up to college, they have stamp of approval and passed certain “tests.” of a successful player (cafe). So if $6,260 sounds solid, then its to move on to the next part. 

In the same sense, you don’t need to ask what the profits are. This can be manipulated by working longer hours, cutting employees, etc…You just ask how much sales you do per month, and roughly you can get a good idea how well the shop is. If net profit is $6,250.00 Well is taht including owner's salary? what is the owner's salary? Minimum wage? or living wage? etc...so profit can be manipulated, but gross revenue can't.Thats why franchise take 5% of gross revenue, not net profit. 

**The Super numbers.** 

Previously, I mentioned you need to make your original investment back in 3 years. So let's calculate that. This shop makes $6,250.00 per month. 

$6,250.00 x 36 months = $225,000.00

**Now the details**

Now this shop was listed for $280,000 instead of $225,000.00 Why would they list it higher than the value of what is appropriate? Now then the third detail kicks in besides asking price and purchase price. They would ask for more b/c….the $6,250.00 is better at face value.

If they ask for more than the textbook price, it's b/c making that $6,250 is easier than the normal method. So on the website, newspaper, broker  it will say something like....

– closed on sunday

\- fully remote, manager operated

\- prime location

Usually something that will say “you are paying more b/c it has X” . Now if it was selling for a lot less like $225,000. Then it means $6,250.00 is harder to make. It will say something like this...

\- profit possible if managed by husband/wife duo

\- lease is finished less than 2 years

\- no employees on weekends. 

You are paying less b/c you are working more. 



**If the number make sense**

Now if you are satisfied with the purchasing price and the gross revenue, now its time to do your due diligence. That $6,250. How is it broken down? How many people work? Who’s working which hours? Do I need to work weekends? How old are the equipment? When is the lease up? Etc…and always remember, they are selling b/c they want out. You have more leverage. 

Minus the gross revenue….I would say rent would be next in the line. Its the most reliable indicator of the value of the location. And Location is like height in basketball. By far, the most important (i’ll write this more later). 

**The truth has no temperature**

The beauty in starting something is knowing that you can always make something better, but you have to understand what you are working with in the first place. You can’t have 5’5 parents and expect to succeed playing basketball. You can have passion for the sports, make money becoming trick shot player, youtube ,commentator,  etc, but not as a basketball player per say in the traditional sense. 

It's irrelevant whether you like coffee, or whether you are good at making coffee. Running a cafe business is not the same as loving coffee. A concept that eludes many many good people who love coffee that want to start the business. 

**Where I went wrong**

1st, I didn’t ask the CPA about the cafe. That was the 1st problem. I bought it based on a trusted friend and his source. 

2nd was getting the “report” card (Profit and Loss sheet) from the owner, not the CPA. The owner can make something up but CPA has no obligation to lie for the client. Since it will be CPA’s ass on the line if caught up in a legal trouble. 

3rd. I was in way too hurried to buy so I started fidgeting with the number (bro\~ I don’t have to pay franchise fee/royalty, this is a killer deal!). This shop was $50,000 at best. I paid double. And the profit is based on owner operated/managed. So it's even worse. I was making $2000-$3000 per month working 40 hours. Technically 80 since my wife worked as well. 

4th. I got into a field I have no idea about. Which is fine since I accepted that the worst case scenario is 2-3 years of experience, but I think I overestimated what the cost that wasn’t associated with the shop was. Stress from work, working weekends/nights costing me and my wife’s date nights, managing negative cash flow shops. 

Naivete knows no bounds. 

**No shame in not knowing something. Be willing to learn** 

I didn’t know this before purchasing b/c I was a moron.I learned this through my CPA after the fact. An owner has to juggle a lot of things and my IQ is 10 points. I have to learn about coffee, people management, marketing, sales, etc… 

CPA number IQ 100000 pts since this is all they do.  A good CPA will walk you through the number and see if it's worth it or not. A shitty CPA will just do the numbers, taxes, etc and leave you to be. Because CPA might know this is a bad shop, but he won't’ get paid if you don't’ buy the shop. So he’ll just do his usual filing for tax, getting you a corporation set up, making you a P/L report. 

A great CPA will break it down for you. The cost is too expensive. Try to negotiate the rent lower next time. This utility company is better, his other client buys from this boba wholesale, etc…

I didn’t know and just picked a decent CPA on my own and once we found out this shop hit the shit, I switched to my parents CPA who’s been with us forever. He came to my wedding, bought me real expensive gifts that most CPAs wouldn’t phantom buy for their client’s son. Because his life was changed b/c of my parents he takes care of us in every way.

He was furious when he found out . He would never let me buy it if he was in the loop in the beginning. His actual words were “JOJO WHAT THE FUCK WERE U THINKING?”

And once again I learned the advice my parents told me the most about business. .  “Business is about people, not about money.” Having the right connection, right people are more important in the long run.

**How do you know… that you know?**

How do you know you overpaid? How do you know your CPA Is good? How do you know if the coffee pricing is right?

As I mentioned previously, you don’t guys. You learn through trial and error. Best way would be to get as close to the actual ownership as possible and the repercussion of mistakes will be left to the owner and not you. And you can take all these lessons that I made, and I can hope you’ll make less. 

I’m set for life in a financial sense….. and in all transparency, if I close the shop and just loses $4000 per month on rent and etc for the rest of the lease… it wouldn’t even tickle my bank account. 

But….

I work hard, I can always look at the mirror and say “I've given all my best despite it all.” Although it doesn’t hurt in a financial sense, it does hurt me personally. I feel like a fraud. Using mommy’s money to start a cafe, a rich kid who couldn’t cut it through, causing stress to my wife b/c my foolish dream, someone who is a imposter and business person in only in name, but that's something I been trying to overcome and hopefully help some of you guys understand.....

that is... it's terrifyingly hard to run a business. I have 5 employees and thats already stressful, i don't’ know how my parents are managing 100+ people.  it will be a wild ride of emotional rollercoaster of stress, sadness, happiness, doubts, anger, fear, etc...

I hope through my stories and mistakes, you guys can learn by proxy and help you on your journey to become a business person. 



See you guys next month!

Entrepreneur,promotion advice,Seeking Advice: Best Commission Structure for Affiliates Promoting My Fixed-Fee SaaS Product?,"Hello fellow entrepreneurs,

I've developed a user-friendly SaaS product that enables anyone to create an online store or manage a restaurant system through a simple chat interface. **The unique selling point (USP) is that anyone who can chat can create a business web app and it offers a fixed monthly fee of 30 Euros with no additional commission fees from us on transactions—just pure software that works.** *(Please note: standard payment processing fees like those from Stripe still apply.)*

It's designed to help brick-and-mortar shops in local communities transition smoothly into the online space without technical hurdles or hidden fees.

I'm looking to partner with motivated individuals who can promote this product to local businesses. They wouldn't be employees but independent affiliates who earn rewards or commissions based on their referrals and sales performance.

**My question is:** What compensation or commission structures have you found most effective for such affiliate arrangements? I'm considering options like flat commissions per sale, recurring commissions for as long as the referred customer remains subscribed, tiered commissions based on performance, or bonuses for hitting certain targets.

I aim to create an incentive program that's attractive and motivating without being overly complicated. I also want to ensure it's fair and sustainable for both parties.

I'd love to hear your insights, experiences, or any suggestions you might have on setting up an effective commission model for affiliates.

Entrepreneur,job offer negotiation,"AI Content Campaign Got 4M impressions, Thousands of Website Views, Hundreds of Customers for About $100 — This is the future of marketing","Alright. So, a few months ago I tested a marketing strategy for a client that I’ve sense dedicated my life to developing on.

The Idea was to take the clients Pillar content (their YouTube videos) and use AI to rewrite the content for all the viable earned media channels (mainly Reddit).

The campaign itself was moderately successful. To be specific, after one month it became their 2nd cheapest customer acquisition cost (behind their organic YouTube content). But there is a lot to be done to improve the concept. I will say, having been in growth marketing for a decade, I felt like I had hit something big with the concept.

I’m going to detail how I built that AI system, and what worked well and what didn’t here. Hopefully you guys will let me know what you think and whether or not there is something here to keep working on.

# 1. DEFINING THE GOAL

Like any good startup, their marketing budget was minimal. They wanted to see results, fast and cheap. Usually, marketers like me hate to be in this situation because getting results usually either takes time or it takes money.

But you can get results fast and cheap if you focus on an earned media strategy - basically getting featured in other people’s publication. The thing is these strategies are pretty hard to scale or grow over time. That was a problem for future me though.

I looked through their analytics and saw they were getting referral traffic from Reddit - it was their 5th or 6th largest source of traffic - and they weren’t doing any marketing on the platform. It was all digital word of mouth there.

It kind of clicked for me there, that Reddit might be the place to start laying the ground work.

So with these considerations in mind the goal became pretty clear:

1. Create content for relevant niche communities on Reddit with the intent of essentially increasing brand awareness.
2. Use an AI system to repurpose their YouTube videos to keep the cost of producing unique content for each subreddit really low.

# 2. THE HIGH-LEVEL STRATEGY

I knew that there are huge amounts of potential customers on Reddit (About 12M people in all the relevant communities combined) AND that most marketers have a really tough time with the platform.

I also knew that any earned media strategy, Reddit or not, means Click Through Rates on our content would be extremely low. A lot of people see this as a Reddit specific problem because you can’t self-promote on the platform, but really you have to keep self-promotion to a minimum with any and all earned media. This basically meant we had to get a lot of impressions to make up for it.

The thing about Reddit is if your post absolutely crushes it, it can get millions of views. But crushing it is very specific to what the expectations are of that particular subreddit.

So we needed to make content that was specifically written for that Subreddit.

With that I was able to essentially design how this campaign would work:

1. We would put together a list of channels (specifically subreddits to start) that we wanted to create content for.
2. For each channel, we would write a content guideline that details out how to write great content for this subreddit.
3. These assets would be stored in an AirTable base, along with the transcripts of the YouTube videos that were the base of our content.
4. We would write and optimize different AI Prompts that generated different kinds of posts (discussion starters about a stock, 4-5 paragraph stock analysis, Stock update and what it means, etc…)
5. We would build an automation that took the YouTube transcripts, ran each prompt on it, and then edited each result to match the channel writing guidelines.
6. And then we would find a very contextual way to leave a breadcrumb back to the client. Always as part of the story of the content.

At least, this is how I originally thought things would go.

# 3. CHOOSING THE RIGHT SUBREDDITS

Picking the right communities was vital.

Here’s the basic rubric we used to pick and prioritize them:

• Relevance: We needed communities interested in stock analysis, personal finance, or investing.  
• Subreddit Size vs. Engagement: Large subreddits offer more potential impressions but can be less focused. Smaller subreddits often have higher engagement rates.  
• Content Feasibility: We had to ensure we could consistently create high-value posts for each chosen subreddit.

We started with about 40 possibilities, then narrowed it down to four or five that consistently delivered upvotes and user signups.

# 4. CREATING CHANNEL-SPECIFIC GUIDES

By the end, creating channel specific writing guidelines looked like a genius decision.

Here’s how we approached it and used AI to get it done quickly:

1. Grabbed Top Posts: We filtered the subreddit’s top posts (change filter to “Top” and then “All Time”) of all time to see the kinds of content that performed best
2. Compiled The Relevant Posts: We took the most relevant posts to what we were trying to do and put them all on one document (basically created one document per subreddit that just had the top 10 posts in that subreddit).
3. Had AI Create Writing Guideline Based On Posts: For each channel, we fed the document with the 10 posts with the instructions “Create a writing guideline for this subreddit based on these high performing posts. I had to do some editing on each guideline but this worked pretty well and saved a lot of time.

Each subreddit got a custom guideline, and we put these inside the “Channels” table of the AirTable base we were developing with these assets.

# 5. BUILDING THE AI PROMPTS THAT GENERATED CONTENT

Alright this is probably the most important section so I’ll be detailed.

Essentially, we took all the assets we developed up until this point, and used them to create unique posts for each channel. This mean each AI prompt was about 2,000 words of context and produced about a 500-word draft.

There was a table in our AirTable where we stored the prompts, as I alluded to earlier. And these were basically the instructions for each prompt. More specifically, they detailed out our expectations for the post.

In other words, there were different kinds of posts that performed well on each channel. For example, you can write a post that’s a list of resources (5 tools we used to…), or a how to guide (How we built…), etc..

Those weren’t the specific ones we used, but just wanted to really explain what I meant there.

That actual automation that generated the content worked as follows:

1. New source content (YouTube video transcript) was added to the Source Content table. This triggered the Automation.
2. The automation grabbed all the prompts in the prompt table.
3. For each prompt in the prompt table, we sent a prompt to OpenAI (gpt-4o) that contained first the prompt and also the source content.
4. Then, for each channel that content prompt could be used on, we sent another prompt to OpenAI that revised the result of the first prompt based on the specific channel guidelines.
5. The output of that prompt was added to the Content table in AirTable.

To be clear, our AirTable had 4 tables:

1. Content
2. Channels
3. Prompts
4. Source Content

The Source Content, Prompts, and Channel Guidelines were all used in the prompt that generated content. And the output was put in the Content table.

Each time the automation ran, the Source Content was turned into about 20 unique posts, each one a specific post type generated for a specific channel.

In other words, we were create a ton of content.

# 6. EDITING & REFINING CONTENT

The AI drafts were never perfect. Getting them Reddit-ready took editing and revising

The main things I had to go in and edit for were:

• Tone Adjustments: We removed excessively cliche language. The AI would say silly things like “Hello fellow redditors!” which sound stupid.  
• Fact-Checking: Financial data can be tricky. We discovered AI often confused figures, so we fact check all stock related metrics. Probably something like 30-40% error rate here.

Because the draft generation was automated, that made the editing and getting publish ready the human bottleneck. In other words, after creating the system I spent basically all my time reviewing the content.

There were small things I could do to make this more efficient, but not too much. The bigger the model we used, the less editing the content needed.

# 7. THE “BREADCRUMB” PROMOTION STRATEGY

No where in my prompt to the AI did I mention that we were doing any marketing. I just wanted the AI to focus on creating content that would do well on the channel.

So in the editing process I had to find a way to promote the client. I called it a breadcrumb strategy once and that stuck.

Basically, the idea was to never overtly promote anything. Instead find a way to leave a breadcrumb that leads back to the client, and let the really interested people follow the trail.

Note: this is supposed to be how we do all content marketing.

Some examples of how we did this were:

* Shared Visuals with a Subtle Watermark: Because our client’s product offered stock data, we’d often include a chart or graph showing a company’s financial metric with the client’s branding in the corner.
* Added Supporting Data from Client’s Website: If we mentioned something like a company’s cash flow statement, we could link to that company’s cash flow statement on the client’s website. It worked only because there was a lot of data on the client’s website that wasn’t gated.

These tactics were really specific to the client. Which is should be. For other companies I would rethink what tactics I use here.

# 8. THE RESULTS

I’m pretty happy with the results

• Impressions:  
– Early on posts averaged \~30,000 apiece, but after about a month of optimization, we hit \~70,000 impressions average. Over about two months, we reached 4 million total impressions.

• Signups:  
– In their signups process there was one of those “Where did you find us?” questions and the amount of people who put Reddit jumped into the few hundred a month. Precise tracking of this is impossible.

• Cost Efficiency (This is based on what I charged, and not the actual cost of running the campaign which is about $100/mo):  
– CPM (cost per thousand impressions) was about $0.08, which is far better than most paid channels.  
– Cost per free user: \~$8-10. After about a 10% conversion rate to a paid plan, our cost per paying user was $80–$100—well below the client’s previous $300–$400.

# 9. HIGHLIGHTS: WHAT WORKED

1. Subreddit-Specific Content: – Tailoring each post’s format and length to the audience norms boosted engagement. Worked out really well. 1 post got over 1M views alone. We regularly had posts that had hundreds of thousands.
2. Breadcrumbs: – We never had anyone call us out for promoting. And really we weren’t. Our first priority was writing content that would crush on that subreddit.
3. Using the Founder’s Existing Material: – The YouTube transcripts grounded the AI’s content in content we already made. This was really why we were able to produce so much content.

# 10. CHALLENGES: WHAT DIDN’T WORK

1. AI is still off: – Maybe it’s expecting too much, but still I wish the AI had done a better job. I editing a lot of content. Human oversight was critical.
2. Scheduling all the content was a pain: – Recently I automated this pretty well. But at first I was scheduling everything manually and scheduling a hundred or so posts was a hassle.
3. Getting Data and Analytics: – Not only did we have not very good traffic data, but the data from reddit had to be collected manually. Will probably automate this in the future.

# 11. COST & TIME INVESTMENT

* Setup:
   * The setup originally took me a couple weeks. I’ve since figured out how to do much faster (about 1 week).
* AirTable
   * Setup here was easy and the tools costs $24/mo so not bad.
* ChatGPT costs were pretty cheap. Less than $75 per month.
   * I’ve sense switched to using o1 which is much more expensive but saves me a lot of editing time
* Human Editing:
   * Because this is the human part of the process and everything else was automated it mean by default all my time was spent editing content. Still this was a lot better than creating content from scratch probably by a factor of 5 or 10. The main expense was paying an editor (or using your own time) to refine posts.

Worth it? Yes even with the editing time I was able to generate way more content that I would have otherwise.

# 12. LESSONS & ACTIONABLE TAKEAWAYS

1. Reddit as a Growth Channel: – If you genuinely respect each subreddit’s culture, you can achieve massive reach on a tight budget.
2. AI + Human Collaboration: – AI excels at first drafts, but human expertise is non-negotiable for polishing and ensuring factual integrity.
3. Soft Promotion Wins: – The “breadcrumb” approach paid off. It might feel like too light a touch, but is crucial for Reddit communities.
4. Create once, repurpose as many times as possible: – If you have blog posts, videos, podcasts, or transcripts, feed them into AI to keep your message accurate and brand-consistent.

# CONCLUSION & NEXT STEPS

If you try a similar approach: • Begin with smaller tests in a few niches to learn what resonates.  
• Create a clear “channel guide” for each community.  
• Carefully fact-check AI-generated posts.  
• Keep brand mentions low-key until you’ve established credibility.",11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1jjt1bn/ai_content_campaign_got_4m_impressions_thousands/,1742933555.0,adamkstinson,1jjt1bn,advice_seeking
Entrepreneur,job offer negotiation,My journey through 3 businesses,"Hey everyone, I wanted to share some of my attempts at entrepreneurship. Successes and failures. I am 31 years old and I graduated college in 2016 with a BS in Industrial Engineering. I never pursued a job in my field. My father was managing a gas station at the time that I went on to help him with and we eventually purchased it from the previous owner and that is my primary income to this day. In the beginning I was working heavy hours but eventually became more hands off and just take care of the important tasks and have employees in place for day to day operation. Therefore I had plenty of free time and have pursued multiple endeavors. I will list them here discuss some pros and cons and why I decided to move on. If anyone is interested in any of these or any new ideas I’d love to chat.

1. Automotive Paint touch-up

I had a buddy who was in this industry for a few years and wanted to branch off and I decided to pursue it with him. Primarily we would try to get agreements from dealerships to let us touch up their vehicles for a set price and also take care of their body work. This could be a very lucrative business but is very cut throat. As GMs come and go they like to change their staff. We would spend full days going into dealerships and offering our services trying to land one. We eventually did land a few but like I said they were very cut throat and we were let go of some due to GMs changing. We would charge $60 dollars per vehicle to do basic paint touch up and scuff clean up. Cars would take us 20-30 minutes usually. We had a van with many diff paints and we would take the color code from the car, make the paint on sight and do the touch up on the lot. Very straight forward. A lot of lots prefer people to paint their bumpers on the lot as well but we wernt capable and that was a big downfall for us. We also never pursued the retail crowd which I personally think could be very lucrative as every single person has rock chips on their car. I think retail could easily be $100+ per car. This was very early in my entrepreneurial journey and was still learning a lot. If I could go back I would have pushed retail a lot harder and marketed more and I think it could still do very well as there just isn’t much competition.

2. Automotive wholesaling

I got into this just because of my passion and knowledge with cars. I did the for about a year and half before I moved on. It is a very saturated market but with the effort it is very possible to make good money. I would do this from home for the most part. I was constantly scouring fb marketplace, craigslist, autotrader, etc, for vehicles “for sale by owner”. There is a auction called Manheim and it is a very big auction and they have a Manheim market report which shows values of any vehicle sold at their auction. And they sell 1000s so there is a lot of data. So when I would find a vehicle I would put it in the database and it will give a value “MMR”. It’s not perfectly accurate but it’s close and there is other sources I used as well. I’d check the carfax. And I’d try to negotiate the price 1500-2000 dollars below MMR. It’s pretty straightforward but it’s competitive and people don’t like to sell their cars to dealers either. But I’d say I sold about 30-40 cars during that time period and I didn’t lose money on a single one. But I had to keep a storefront to have my license and i eventually wanted to move on and didn’t want to keep that responsibility of paying that rent each month which Is why I moved on. Still to this day if I see a good deal online I will purchase it and hold on to it for a bit and sell it eventually. I just did that with a 2008 jaguar xj8 that I got for like 5500 and sold for 10500. Great flip but most aren’t that good. But if you jump on them first (within 15-20 min of being listed) it is possible.

3. Epoxy flooring

This is my most recent endeavor. I got my floor done and the guys came and knocked out my 3 car garage in 5-6 hours and it wasn’t cheap either. So it got me to thinking man there is some money in this. But little did I know it is very labor intensive. Me, my brother and a buddy decided to get some equipment and give it a shot. We made a brand, website, etc. we were very legit. Did a few floors for free for some practice and we were confident. Started doing some jobs and they went well but we quickly realized to the job correctly it’s not a 5 hour job. To grind the floors thoroughly edges and all takes time. The prep is very important and we didn’t want to do a mediocre job so it took us some time. But there’s opportunity we were getting quote requests and it just came down to us being lazy and not wanting to do the jobs. I still haven’t taken down my website and actually got a quote request yesterday. We are in Texas and it’s 100 degrees in the summer. Dealing with a lot of concrete dust and chemicals turned me away from it as well. Cost of premium materials for a standard 2 car garage was about $900-1000 dollars and any decent company is easily charging $2500. The margins are there for people who want to do the work but it wasn’t for us.

So I’m in this position now. Still making great money from my store. I also have a rental property that cash flows well. Just looking to get started on my next endeavor. I will never give up and I will keep going until I find something that resonates with me or makes a ton of money. If anyone wants to chat about any of these or has any other ideas I’m open to chatting!",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1mgo8o4/my_journey_through_3_businesses/,1754240163.0,omzieee46,1mgo8o4,advice_seeking
Entrepreneur,job offer negotiation,"Being let go from my job, never felt more ready to start my own agency. Looking for advice and suggestions","I am a web developer with 14 years of experience. Since the end of 2023 I’ve been serving this multinational company maintaining Shopify stores for their clients.

Currently trying to negotiate a severance/settlement amount with the company that would probably result in $10k - $20k after taxes considering the length of my fixed-term contract that is supposed expire by the end of this year.

I have some freelance clients outside of my full time job for web development that would also help me a bit in the meantime. On top of the settlement I’m receiving.

That being said, I feel like this might be the perfect opportunity to take a couple weeks off to recharge (I have been severely hurt mentally due to the toxic work environment) and then start my own thing.

I tried applying for jobs but the market looks so terrifying (100s of applications for entry level roles) that I am almost certain I don’t want to get back into another full-time job and would rather try to utilize these funds to sustain for the time being and try to kickstart something of my own (and so many rules and requirements just to land a freaking interview!!)

I continue to receive attention from potential clients (from word of mouth and LinkedIn) I feel like I might have just enough to start my own agency.

That being said, while I may have good communication skills and my work speaks for itself for the most part I am completely new to entrepreneurship and marketing and desperately need to connect with other entrepreneurs especially those who’ve been in the market long enough.

Also my ADHD just makes it worse with all the overwhelming thoughts like “what services to offer?” etc etc.

I’m both excited and nervous. Any advice and suggestions are welcome. You can also reach out to me with help/ideas :)

Entrepreneur,how to get promoted,"My friend stopped me from building and forced me to sell first. He was right, this is brutal","I took the leap into the solopreneur world. My plan was to disappear for a few months, build a product and launch it.

Luckily, a smart entrepreneur friend stopped me. He said “Building stuff is the easy part. Getting people to actually buy it is what’s hard. Try to sell your idea first before you build anything.""

He was 100% right. I'm hitting a wall.

The problem is I have zero audience. I have always been a lurker on social media, so I have no followers to show my idea to. Most online communities have strict ""no self-promotion"" rules (which I get), so I can't post there. I feel like I have no options and I'm just going to look like a spammer.

It seems like my only choices are:

1. Burn money on Google ads
2. Send tons of cold emails that everyone hates getting. And this supposes you have or can find the contacts to reach out to

So I want to ask the people who have actually done it: If you started with ZERO audience, how did you really get your first paying customers?

Entrepreneur,how to get promoted,"Built a business throughout my 20s, but I feel stuck, lonely, and behind my peers","I’m a woman in my late 20s, a wife (no kids yet, we’re trying), and i’ve spent nearly a decade building a business in the service industry. I started it before i even finished my bachelor’s degree (so i have no other experience). Over time, it’s grown from a small startup into a stable, conventional business. Today, i lead a medium sized team (around 150 people), and the business provides income not only for them, but also for hundreds to possibly thousands of ecosystem partners.

Laterlg, i’ve been struggling with loneliness, demotivation, and a deep sense that i’m falling behind.

Most of my friends chose corporate or academic paths. Some have completed master’s or even PhDs at top global universities. They’re hitting career milestones, earning promotions, gaining titles, and being recognized in our alumni networks. Even those who started businesses after getting graduate degrees from prestigious schools seem to receive way more support and recognition especially because of their graduate background. Meanwhile, i often feel like i’m just standing still.

As a business owner, there’s no clear “career ladder.” No next title. No mentor. No coworkers to talk to as peers. Even though i manage a big team, i often feel like i’m working alone in my own bubble and that kind of isolation is hard to explain. Not to mention the mental exhaustion the challenges never really stop, they just change.

Financially, i take a modest salary, probably less than many friends working in large companies. That’s partly my choice, because most of the income goes back into operations and supporting the team especially because profit margins in this space aren’t huge. When i compare myself to others, it sometimes feels like my personal life isn’t growing the way theirs is.

I’ve also pulled away from social media. I’ve always been low profile, and over time i'm not confident enough to post anything, not even in linkedin. I rarely post anything, and sometimes i feel like i’ve gone completely invisible, like life is passing me by.

I keep wondering am i on the right path? or did I waste my 20s building something that now feels heavy and isolating? (esp because my business was invested by some people so i cant really relax, and have to hit their expectation)

How do you find a sense of growth when there’s no clear “next step” anymore?

I really want to know if anyone else has ever felt this way, and if so, how you found your way forward. Or if you have another point of view, that will be very appreciated.

Update: 
Thanks so much for all the kind feedback and perspectives. I honestly didn’t expect to receive so much support, even through DMs and I’m really happy and touched by it!

Just to share a bit more: my business is related to events, beauty, and fashion. That’s why we have quite a big team, and we also work closely with a lot of vendors and freelancers, because we really need them.

It’s been almost 10 years since the very beginning, when I first started experimenting with the business. We actually pivoted twice in the first 3 years, so things were definitely not easy. The business only became more stable (meaning I don’t need to be involved 24/7) from around 3 years ago. So yes, it’s been a rough journey, but one that has taught me a lot.

I love what I do, but just like many people say, it can feel very lonely sometimes. Seeing amazing posts from friends on LinkedIn about their career growth and achievement, while I literally only have one job listed on my profile, was honestly what pushed me to finally write and share my story.

But despite all the ups and downs, I’m still very grateful. I feel like this is the right path for me and all of the comments makes me feel even more proud about it. Even though there were moments I really questioned everything, like during COVID, when I almost sold my car just to pay salaries for my team. But yes, that’s part of the journey!

Entrepreneur,toxic workplace,Are we just feeding the cycle of toxic workplaces as entrepreneurs?,"
Hi everyone,

A lot of people start their entrepreneurial journeys because they had bad experiences in the corporate world, whether it was because of toxic work environments, lack of flexibility, or a feeling of being undervalued. 

But the corporate world is made up of people, and it’s often people who create those negative environments.

As entrepreneurs, aren’t we just feeding into the cycle? 

If we leave toxic companies only to create more companies without addressing those core problems, are we really making progress? 

What are you doing in your company to create a better environment for your employees or teams? 

How do we ensure that we don’t just repeat the same mistakes we wanted to escape from?

Entrepreneur,toxic workplace,Leave my 9-5 today or wait ,"Hi everyone,

This is my first post in the subreddit and I apologize in advance for the desperate tone of my post. 

I’m a pretty skilled communications professional that works as a principal for one of the largest companies in the world. By all accounts, it’s a good job that earns about $135K a year with a 25% bonus and solid benefits. 

The problem I am faced with is that I have spent 15 years working in the corporate world and I think I’m at the end of the line. The toxic workplace culture, the ass kissing, the backstabbing, etc. The demanding hours would be fine if it was my own company I was building but instead, I’m constantly being pulled far passed a balanced work life, and there is no reward for the extra effort. 

I can write down all of the value figures that I offer this company and it far exceeds my earnings with them, and the resentment I have for not following my dreams as an entrepreneur is growing by the day. It’s all I talk about to everyone including my therapist. 

The problem is that I have two young children, and not enough energy to work 60 hours a week for this company and also try and build something on my own. 

The skills that have always differentiated me in my career are photography, filmmmaking, social media strategy and content creation… all of those mixed with just a sound business communications foundation. I know I sound like a chauchy arrogant loser, but there are few comms professionals at my level that have the same or even a similar skillset. Every time they can feel me pulling away, they offer me something more. 

To make matters worse, I am surrounded by people who thrive in salaried jobs and so all of the advice that my family and friends give me is to just be grateful for my good job, but I daydream all day long of building my own businesses. Not just one, but several. I’ve written business plans for a couple businesses and I can already think of at least 5 income streams that I could earn money very quickly. 

I know that I will eventually just be creating my own thing. But I’m surrounded by naysayers and have no mentors to look up to, and I also value the opinions of the people close to me, even if I don’t agree. 

Would love to hear everyone’s thoughts, including anyone who has been in a similar cross in the road. My heart tells me I’m an entrepreneur. I know the reasonable thing would be to start building something now, but in my mind the incremental value of a side hustle just means I’m not using all of my energy to build something great. I’ve done that in the past with photography and earned $100K in a year but I was working around 80 hours a week.

My mom offered me a space in her shop as a starting point for when I'm ready to quit and go out on my own

The workplace is toxic though, and everyday there drains me that little bit....but I have gained a lot of skills and experience 

I wanted advice on those who have done similar or know someone who has done similar...what are things I can do to best succeed?

Entrepreneur,toxic workplace,How to find first client?,"How I found the first client

Summarising the steps here: 

Step 1 know what clients want 

Compare these 2 questions: 

1 Are u ready to start a business? 

2 Are you tired of toxic workplace in 9-5 job and desire more freedom?

That makes a difference as to whether a potential client would consider whether to engage you. 

Use their language 

Step 2 know ur solution

Describe the results ppl want 

Dont just say ur process which they are not familiar about and would second doubt whether to buy from you

Step 3 give a quick win for free

So they would pay to work with you further 

Its that simple. 

Focus on this and guarantee you ll get client

Entrepreneur,systemic burnout,I scaled multiple businesses to 6-figures by using health as my competitive advantage. AMA,"Hey entrepreneurs! I've gotten a lot of useful advice here so it's time to give back to the community.

I started my entrepreneurial journey in 2016, failing 7 different online businesses in 3 years. I was that guy running on 5-6 hours of sleep, trying to work as much as I could every single day. Had migraines, zero energy, and couldn't focus on work for more than 1 hour. 

After failing those businesses, I started my first successful one in 2020. I was a broke college student with just $50 in my account. Hit 6-figures after 8 months. Wasn't an overnight success, I had learned a lot about business fundamentals from my previous failures. But the real difference this time was fixing my health first. I finally had the energy, the focus and clarity to execute properly without falling apart.

In the last 6 years, I've studied over 1000 hours of research on performance & health optimization. I've tested everything from supplements to workout routines while running my businesses. Gained 45lbs of muscle, got rid of my migraines and low energy, and built systems to prevent burnout.

Most entrepreneurs sacrifice health to grow their business… I did it too. But it actually slows down your growth. Bad sleep means poor decisions and low energy. No energy means low business outcomes. Being unhealthy is expensive in the long run.

If you're stuck with low energy, no motivation, or burning out while trying to scale your business, ask me anything. I'll share what actually works based on science and real experience.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",91,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1ija0h3/i_scaled_multiple_businesses_to_6figures_by_using/,1738867656.0,Rodrigom39,1ija0h3,advice_seeking
Entrepreneur,systemic burnout,"A mompreneur, tried dozens of coping methods - here’s what I wish someone told me earlier","In this turmoil time, I just wanted to share what I’ve learned, and hope it’s helpful to some of you. When I started running my own small business after having my kids, I thought I can handle this. After all, juggling night feedings, daycare, and household chores made me believe I was unstoppable.

But I was wrong. Trying to grow a business while also caring for a toddler is freaking hard. With client calls, emails, managing orders, and tantrums, I was constantly overwhelmed. I knew if I kept going like this, it was just a matter of time before everything is fk up

So I turned to productivity youtube, podcasts, books, like basically anything possible. Some are great, some are crazy. If you're feeling overwhelmed, these three methods changed everything for me

1. GTD Method (Getting Things Done): The moment something pops into your head - orders, client requests, home chores - dump it into a reliable system. Your brain is not for storing tasks, it's for creating ideas. Clearing that mental clutter saved me from burnout.
2. Deep Work by Cal Newport: Multitasking nearly ruined me. When I scheduled specific chunks of time (even just 25 minutes) for focused work and actually followed it, my productivity improved
3. Atomic Habits by James Clear: Small, sustainable changes are the key. I especially like the 2-minute rule: Starting new habits by breaking them down into tasks that take two minutes or less to complete

But, theory is one thing, applying it is a different beast, especially when you're constantly exhausted. Here's what I used to get over the hardship

* Google Calendar: Simple, to block deep work sessions and client meetings.
* OneSec: This puts a delay before I open any social media app for scrolling like IG, TT. This saved me a bunch of time!
* Sticky Notes: Simple yet powerful. Every morning, I write my single most crucial task on a big sticky note and throw it away once completed 🙂
* Work Assistant: Saner app, so far is the only one that turns my emails, rant into tasks and reminders. I dump all my docs, notes into it, it’s my GTD system
* ChatGPT: I use the paid version. Especially helpful in researching, creating content and general purpose things
* AI Meeting Note: I use Granola, it’s good cause I don’t have to allow bots to join meetings

My days are still chaotic, but now the chaos feels more manageable. If you're a working fulltime mom or an overwhelmed entrepreneur, I just want to say: You’re gonna be ok. You’re not behind. You don’t have to apply hundreds of methods. Just improve 1% every day, and things will get better

If you have an approach or tool that helped you manage your business & life effectively, would love to hear it 🙂",71,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1kj5oky/a_mompreneur_tried_dozens_of_coping_methods_heres/,1746866575.0,CoAdin,1kj5oky,advice_seeking
Entrepreneur,systemic burnout,A quick no-BS guide from someone who started an E-commerce side hustle with nearly nothing and has pulled down 8 figures from it. Paying it forward with an AMA here :),"Seven years ago I was nearly homeless. Fast forward to today, and I’ve built a successful e-commerce brand that's done 8 figures in revenue and employs \~25 people. I started with only a few hundred bucks after selling everything in my 300 square food studio apartment except a futon and an old iMac.

I began my online journey by freelancing in email/SMS marketing automation and conversion rate optimization and eventually used those skills to create my own D2C brand after many, many failures. I’ve been broke with no mentor and not knowing what info was real or not. This is me paying it forward with a no-BS list of what actually moves the needle when you're starting, and I'll answer Qs as I can, too.

Here goes, hope this helps:

**Be Specific or Be Forgotten**  
Niche down, not up. If you try to appeal to everyone, you’ll appeal to no one. Define a very specific target customer or problem. For example, instead of saying “I sell to anyone with pets,” narrow it down: “I help first-time dog owners in apartments solve potty training issues.” When you get specific, your marketing becomes easier & more effective because you can speak directly to the people who actually need your product/service. Specificity sells. Trying to target everyone means you’re targeting no one. So get really specific with your pain point, product, and audience.

**Validate Demand with Cheap Tests**  
Test before you invest. Don’t assume your idea will work; prove it. Set up a simple landing page or even a single ad describing your offer, and run a small, cheap ad campaign to gauge interest (think $5–$10 daily on Reddit Ads). Anything measured improves. If you get zero clicks or sign-ups, that tells you something important for a few bucks. If you get some traction, you just validated that you’re onto something. This is the Ready > Fire > Aim mentality: launch quickly, get real feedback/data, then refine your targeting. It’s far better than spending months building something only to hear crickets.

**Track and Measure Everything**  
Data or it didn’t happen. From day one, install analytics and pixel tracking. If you have a website or landing page, get Google Analytics on it. Running any ads? Make sure the pixel is set up to track sessions and conversions. Keep an eye on key metrics (click-through rates, conversion rates, cost per acquisition, etc.). When you send emails, track open and click rates. Split test. The mantra here is “anything measured, improves.” When you monitor a metric, you can actively work to improve it. You can’t fix what you don’t measure, so track everything important. Over time, these numbers will tell you exactly what’s working and what isn’t, so you can double down on what works and fix or drop what doesn’t.

**Get Feedback**  
Talk to your customers, because the way your product is positioned is probably going to be slightly off target from what they want. Use surveys to get inside your customers’ heads. Ask questions and measure the responses. Pay attention to their pain points and the emotional state they want to be in after that problem is solved. This info helps you refine your messaging and offering. Again, it’s all about measurement and feedback. If you gather and listen to real responses, you can tailor your product/service and marketing to fit like a glove.

**You Can Learn Anything, and Fast**  
Hit up ChatGTP or legit sources for info like ConversionXL, Digital Marketer, the free content I offer, and similar - then quickly put it into practice.  The operating phrase here is ""put it into practice"". Skim the basics, implement, then optimize from there both by doing and by learning.

**Focus is a Skill**  
Work in focused bursts. If you struggle with staying on task, try the Pomodoro technique: 25 minutes of undistracted work, 5-minute break, repeat. During those 25 minutes, zero notifications, no checking social media, no music, no video or TV on in the background, etc. This trains you to work with intensity and avoid burnout. You’ll be shocked how much you get done when you truly focus. Single-tasking beats multitasking every time for actual productivity.

**One Thing at a Time**  
No multitasking, no shiny object syndrome. Pick one idea, project or goal and go all-in on that. Juggling multiple business ideas or strategies at once is a recipe for doing a bunch of things poorly. Figure out the one thing that will move the needle most for you right now and commit to it. For example, if you’re validating a product, focus solely on that until you get solid data. You gain momentum and make wins by concentrating your effort.

**Take Care of Yourself**  
Don’t sacrifice essentials. Hustle culture might glorify sleepless nights, but working yourself into the ground is dumb if it destroys your health. You’ll do your best work when you’re well-rested and feeling good. So get your 7-8 hours of sleep. Your brain cleans up and your creativity resets during sleep. Get some physical activity in your routine (even a 20-minute daily walk or a quick workout) to keep your energy up and stress down. These aren’t really optional, they’re part of the job. A burnt-out, sleep-deprived entrepreneur is an ineffective entrepreneur.

**What You Eat Matters...a Lot**  
Fuel like a player: your focus and mood are hugely affected by nutrition. Make sure you’re covering the basics: stay hydrated, eat clean when you can, and consider supplements to fill the gaps. Taking care of your body means your mind can operate at full capacity. If you find yourself foggy or unfocused, sometimes the fix isn’t another productivity hack, it might be related to your nutrition (I have a book coming out on this subject as well). Bottom line: treat your body like the support system for your business, because it is.

**Action, not Perfection**  
Execution is everything. You can read, watch, and learn all the strategies in the world, but none of it matters if you never implement. Don’t get stuck in analysis paralysis or “research mode” forever and never, ever try to be a perfectionist. For every hour you spend learning, spend 3-5 hours doing. Launch that test, write those sales emails, reach out to that potential collaborator, whatever moves you forward. Don't try to be a perfectionist, that'll get you nowhere.

**Set Up Your Funnel (Capture, Nurture, Upsell)**  
Don’t waste any click or lead. If you’re driving traffic (paid or organic), have a system to capture and nurture those visitors. At minimum, set up a landing page or website with an opt-in form to collect emails. Then, automate a follow-up welcome email series to introduce yourself, deliver value, and build trust.

**Embrace Failure and Keep Iterating**  
Failure is data. No matter how smart you are, not every idea or campaign will work. In fact, most will flop. Expect that. It’s not the end of the world; it’s feedback and it's how you learn. Maybe your offer wasn’t aligned properly, maybe your targeting was off, maybe your landing page sucked, maybe a product:audience mismatch. Good, now you know and can fix it. Each failure teaches you something if you’re paying attention. Treat each attempt as an experiment. Don't beat yourself up when it fails, because you WILL fail...but not forever.

**NEVER Give Up**  
Stay in the game. The only way you lose for good is if you give up. I say this from experience. I was literally almost homeless more than once, barely scraping by for years, and to start my first successful company (after dozens of failures) I sold everything except a mattress and my computer. I kept at it, freelancing to scrape by, learning new marketing skills, and testing my own ideas on the side. Eventually, after a lot of trials, I found a formula that clicked. So will you.

**TL;DR**  
Ultra-specific focus and cheap tests > measure everything > focus on one project while staying healthy > take action > set up an automated funnel > expect failures, learn from them, and keep iterating. Stay in the game and you can’t lose.

Hoped this helped. Got a question, any question? Hit me! ✌️

Entrepreneur,systemic burnout,"
The Hardest Lesson I Learned as an Entrepreneur (Wish Someone Had Told Me Sooner!)","Hey everyone! I wanted to share something that took me years (and plenty of mistakes) to figure out as an entrepreneur. Looking back, if there’s one lesson that really changed the way I do things, it’s this:

Stop Trying to Do It All Yourself.

When I first started, I thought I had to be the one to handle everything. Sales? Me. Marketing? Me. Customer service? You guessed it me I was wearing every hat, thinking it was the only way to succeed. But here’s the truth I learned the hard way: trying to do everything alone only leads to burnout and keeps you from actually growing.

Here's what helped me break out of that cycle:

1. Learn to Delegate – This was hard for me, but handing off tasks doesn’t mean you’re losing control. It means you’re making room for what truly matters.
2. Focus on Your Strengths figure out what you’re best at and double down on that. Let others handle the areas where they excel. It frees up your time and makes your business stronger.
3. Build Systems, Not Just Hours – Hustling 24/7 only gets you so far. Creating systems that work even when you’re not around is a game-changer.

I know how tempting it is to try to “do it all,” especially in the early days. But trust me, knowing when to step back and let others help is one of the smartest moves you can make.

If anyone else has been through this, I’d love to hear how you dealt with it. Let’s learn from each other’s experiences!",97,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1gdwpx0/the_hardest_lesson_i_learned_as_an_entrepreneur/,1730102199.0,Zestyclose_Flow_680,1gdwpx0,advice_seeking
Entrepreneur,systemic burnout,How to Prevent Burnout as a Founder and Save Your Business,"This is something I wish someone had told me years ago.

When you start a business, everyone talks about the obvious risks. Cash flow. Marketing. Product market fit. Hiring the right people.

What almost no one tells you is that one of the biggest threats to your business is not external.

It is functional burnout.

Not the kind where someone calls in sick because they are exhausted, although that happens too. I am talking about the more silent version. The version where your team is technically showing up but mentally checked out. Most of us have seen it.

# This is how it looks

* Slower decision making
* Constant mistakes that should not happen
* Endless overthinking
* Poor communication
* Passive aggression creeping into conversations
* Just get it done replaces critical thinking

This does not happen overnight. It builds gradually. A little extra pressure here. A tight deadline there. Then suddenly the team that used to be sharp, proactive and creative becomes reactive, risk averse and sluggish.

And if you are a solo founder or running lean, you might notice it in yourself first. Decision fatigue becomes real. The smallest tasks feel disproportionately hard. You start avoiding things. Important decisions get delayed because your brain just does not have the processing power left.

# Here is the truth

Most small businesses do not fail because of bad ideas.  
They fail because the cognitive bandwidth of the founder and key team members gets quietly eroded over time.

# Burnout looks like a motivation problem. It is not.

It is a nervous system problem.

When you are stuck in constant fight or flight mode with cortisol spiking and your nervous system overloaded, the prefrontal cortex, the part of your brain responsible for problem solving, rational thinking and long term planning, starts going offline.

Think of it like your computer going into safe mode.

No productivity hack can fix this. You cannot run high-performance software on hardware that is overheated and stuck in safe mode.

# So what do you do

This is what I wish someone had drilled into me sooner. Burnout prevention is not about bubble baths or meditation apps. It's operational. It's strategic.

* **Hard boundaries around cognitive load** If everything is urgent, nothing is. Protect time for high quality thinking. Batch decision making. Delegate micro decisions aggressively.
* **Normalise recovery cycles** You would not run a machine 24 7 without downtime. Yet entrepreneurs do this with their minds constantly. Treat recovery, actual recovery, as a business function. Not a luxury.
* **Look at how pressure flows in your company** Most founders unconsciously push pressure down the chain. Middle managers absorb it. They push it further. Eventually, quality control breaks. Communication fractures. People quit.
* **Upgrade your leadership not just your systems** Leading under pressure is a skill set nobody teaches you. It is not about motivational slogans. It is about learning how to regulate stress in yourself and others. If you do not develop this, no project management software will save you.

# Here's the thing

When I fixed this in my own business, profits went up. But more importantly, the quality of thinking improved. Problems that felt impossible became solvable. The accountant noticed. Clients noticed. Team morale changed.

You cannot solve 2025s business problems with an operating system designed for the 1950s work harder until you break ethos.

This is one of the most overlooked causes of business failure and the good news is it is completely fixable.

Entrepreneur,systemic burnout,I'm working on a calendar tool to prevent burnout. Looking for feedback,"Hey there,

I’ve been experimenting with a calendar tool that helps automatically rearrange your daily schedule (tasks, meetings, events) to reduce burnout and cognitive fatigue.

The goal is simple:

1. You connect or upload your calendar

2. The tool detects burnout risks (e.g., stacked deep work, too many meetings, energy-heavy blocks)

3. Then it intelligently reschedules flexible items, spreads out workloads, and avoids task spillover into evenings

It's still an early framework, but I think this could help solo founders or anyone juggling multiple roles.

Curious to hear from this community. Do you experience burnout from unmanaged calendars or task overload?

Would an auto-rearranging system like this be useful to you?

Appreciate any thoughts or advice. Thank you :)",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1lu5cus/im_working_on_a_calendar_tool_to_prevent_burnout/,1751920774.0,Academic_Air3155,1lu5cus,advice_seeking
Entrepreneur,surviving my job,13 years later - I don't think I'd do it again....,"All of the late nights, the missed catchups, the literal gray hairs, the lost friendships, and frankly my sanity are the expenses I've paid for remaining self-employed for the last 13 years, it's funny people always think the choice to start my own business was brave, but that's a lie - it was just a whim - I was 24 years old had nothing to lose living at home and hopes of ""making it"" before it was an internet trend, but what you don't take into account as a 24 year old is oppertunity cost, you're so deep and fighting like crazy for that dream that you just wake up one day and think fuck I'm 37 was this all a miscalcualtion, how did you let it go so far.... And to be fair I've had some big highs and recently more lows, but I don't really know what I have to show for it, I certainly didn't ""make it"", but like always my ego isn't ready to be ""like everybody else"" which is so fucking retarded because everybody else has a life, they have balance and frankly make far more than I do with far less stress. 

I am so far from where I started, still trying to find that business that will make me happy, but I really don't know if its out there anymore. Maybe it's time to just get a job... maybe not. My biggest fear is that I'll wake up at 60 and be thinking the same thing. It's funny you'd think somebody that has survived 13 years in business would be ""made for it"" but I really don't know, maybe it was just a fluke. 

Life is so complciated, and I feel so beaten, Ive just started a new company but I feel like Im starting with an empty tank, probably my best idea in 13 years but my energy levels are just fucking beat, my mind is beat, I'm just numb to everything. 

If it wasn't for my kids I honestly don't know if I'd still be here. I just keep asking myself how did I make such a huge mistake and why did I keep making it for so long.

Entrepreneur,surviving my job,"I rather die than work a corporate job, but my entrepreneur journey isn't going well.","I worked a corporate job at a Big 4 consulting firm for about 4 years fresh out of Uni and although I was a top performer, I hated it. So.. I decided to quit and try my own thing. I really couldn't continue. I know ppl say "" build your side hustle before quiting"" but I had no time or energy or emotional bandwidth while I was working as a legal consultant. I was seriously considering taking my own life. 

Originally, I wanted to build and sell software targeted to people in my legal field. But, after reading some books about entrepreneurship, I realized I probably should build some sort of audience first and see if there is actually any interest in what I had planned before investing time and money into an idea. So i decided to work freelance first to build up a client base that could evenetually buy something like software from me, also to understand my target's problems and if what I had in mind would actually benefit them. I got a few small freelance projects but clients wanted to pay pennies for months of work. Although I always got very good testimonals after I finished my work. I realized that I needed to prove my value to attract higher ticket clients. I am confident about the quality of my work, but of course other people who never worked with me cannot have the same confidence and therefore pick me over someone else who offers the same for a cheaper price... I offered to work for free for several  companies who I know are likely Big 4 clients to prove my worth and the quality of my work (before charging anything) I never got any responses with this cold outreach, and I'd spend hours a day researching these companies to send cold emails showing I knew about their business and the issues they faced. Because this didn't work and freelance jobs weren't paying very well, I decided to start a weekly newsletter to show my knowledge and I post free tools every week. I've continued applying to freelance jobs on Upwork. 

It's been six weeks since i started my newsletter and no bites. At the end of every newsletter I mention that I am working freelance and provide a link to book a free first consultation with me... no bites. I have 72 subscribers to my free newsletter now, i post it on LinkedIn. I've also tried to sell small ticket items (e.g., templates for a few buck) but not one purchase. 

It has been 6 months since I started and I've made about 1,000 bucks TOTAL.  I've always lived very modestly and so I can survive for a long time off my savings.. but I'm starting to feel a little hopeless and I'm wondering if I can get some advice. I really don't want to go back to corporate life.

Entrepreneur,surviving my job,If you surround yourself with Rich and successful people you have more chances of becoming successful. ,"Recently i had a discussion with one of my wealthy client and he was telling me that i should move to a wealthy neighborhood as i will get to mingle in higher net worth crowd for better opportunities for me and my future generations. 

Well after having a discussion with him i pondered about people who i was surrounded with when i was growing up and evaluated, how it impacted me and my friends. 

I grew up in not a wealthy neighborhood mostly people who have either small shops or people who are doing 9-5 to survive, well people who i saw growing up are still their they have not moved or their lifestyle not have changed. 

My friends are mostly in 9-5 jobs the only improvement i saw in them is they either save to travel somewhere for few days or saving to build their home. 

Few of my friends who left for better colleges and had better circles in my college make 3-4X more money than my friends who stayed in our neighborhood. 

As i was lucky to be able to work with wealthy and smart people since i was young i was able to struggle for my opportunities also i noticed whatever reference i got for work was from these people with money, and i have hardly gotten any work from my neighborhood connects. 

So surrounding yourself with rich and smart people will also help you get rich, yeah it is True, but would i get the same emotional connection with the people of my old neighborhood i would not, as people with money they will do you a favor if you are capable of doing them a favor when needed so yeah surrounding myself with successful people will help my future generation as well as me to grow.

To give you some context, I started an anonymous page on Instagram as a playful art project/joke, and it somehow developed a strong community and attention from a good handful of influential people in my niche.. so I guess at this point, I'm a brand. To make things worse, a famous musical artist got their hands on a sample item recently and it ended up all over social media. I have no plan to capitalize on that because I'm in such a rut. I don't even have a consistent sales model but no one knows that.

It has led me to accept that I'm more of a creative person than a businessman. From creative output to personal finances and relationships, everything has suffered because I was not able to accept this earlier. For example, I'm screwing up lots of administrative and shipping tasks because I lack the business infrastructure, experience, and mental clarity needed for the volume I'm receiving. I have the demand, but no capacity (both physical and mental space) to meet the demand. I also think I've developed trust issues due to a failed partnership that made me have to start from square one. If it weren't for my now ex-partner, I wouldn't have realized how traumatic that failed partnership was. Since then, very few people try to offer help but no one has proven themselves capable of filling my shoes, so I refuse the help in order to avoid disappointment. Also, I'm a bit sour because no one I've helped in the past has even considered asking how things are doing. That said, I've found myself the loneliest I've ever been in my life. I've always been okay with being alone with my thoughts and entertaining myself, but this shit is different. It's like there's a layer of envy in my interactions with mutuals and acquaintances because no one expected my brand to grow the way it did.. I hope I'm wrong.

I've been looking into how to sell my business so someone else can realize the potential of the brand, because I don't know how to get out of the deficit I put myself in from a series of clerical errors and overall mismanagement (growing apathy and resentment towards my business). I'm tired of worrying about liquidity issues while also having to be the guy to write the code to my website, design and print the items, handle all these damn social media DMs, and plan + execute content ideas?? I had to use A.I. on in-studio editorial photos of myself because I just don't have connections to models that fit the brand. I don't know how to separate my personal expenses from my business expenses without trying to get back in the job market with a gap in my resume. I'm considering moving to Southeast Asia simply so I can reduce expenses and catch up on bills. Does this sound ass backwards? I'm really lost and often find myself surrounded by people who are unable to give me any useful advice or guidance.

All in all, I realized I loved doing it when I didn't have to depend on it to survive, that's the only way I was able to make the things that people were attracted to in the first place. Now I'm finding myself mentally paralyzed on a daily basis, because I know I'm sitting on something good but I just can't seem to stay connected to it. 

Sorry for the rant, it's probably all over the place. Hope I'm not breaking any rules. I just don't know who to talk to about this. I don't know what to do. I can disclose the brand in a private message. I might go back to cooking in restaurants because of how bad my resume gap looks, especially in this job market (I'm a god damn graphic designer in 2025 lol)",54,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1m3mbod/killing_my_own_success_because_i_operate_alone/,1752896325.0,needhelpescaping,1m3mbod,advice_seeking
Entrepreneur,surviving my job,"Started a content marketing agency 8 years ago - $0 to $7,863,052 (2025 update)","Hey friends,

My name is Tyler and for the past 8 years, I’ve been documenting my experience building a content marketing agency called Optimist.

* Year 1 — 0 to $500k ARR
* Year 2 — $500k to $1MM ARR
* Year 3 — $1MM ARR to $1.5MM(ish) ARR
* Year 4 — $3,333,686 Revenue
* Year 5 — $4,539,659 Revenue
* Year 6 — $5,974,324 Revenue
* Year 7 - $6,815,503 Revenue

(Edit: Seems like links are banned now. You can check my post history for all of my previous updates with lessons and learnings.)

# How Optimist Works

First, an overview/recap of the Optimist business model:

* We operate as a “collective” of full time/professional freelancers
* Everyone aside from me is a contractor
* Entirely remote/distributed team
* We pay freelancers a flat fee for most work, working out to roughly $65-100/hour.
* Clients pay us a flat monthly fee for full-service content marketing (research, strategy, writing, editing, design/photography, reporting and analytics, targeted linkbuilding, and more)\*
* Packages range in price from \~$10-20k/mo

\**This is something we are revisiting now*

# The Financials

In 2024, we posted **$1,032,035.34** in revenue.

This brings our lifetime revenue to $7,863,052.

Here’s our monthly revenue from January 2017 to December of 2024.

(Edit: Seems like I'm not allowed to link to the chart.)

The good news:

Revenue is up 23% YoY.

EBITDA in Q4 trending up 1-2 points.

We hosted our first retreat in 4 years, going to Ireland with about half the team.

The bad news:

Our revenue is still historically low. At $1MM for the year, we’re down about 33% from our previous years over $1.5MM.

Revenue has been rocky. It doesn’t feel like we’ve really “recovered” from the bumps last year. The trend doesn’t really look great. Even though, anecdotally, it feels like we are moving in a good direction.

EBITDA is still hovering at around 7%. Would love to get that closer to 20%.

(For those who may ask: I’m calculating EBITDA after paying taxes and W2 portion of my income.)

Almost every year, my update starts the same way:

*This has been a year of growth and change.*

Both for my business—and me personally.

2024 was no different.

I guess that tells you something about entrepreneurship.

It’s a lot more like sailing a ship than driving a car.

You’re constantly adapting, tides are shifting, and any blip of calm is usually just a moment before the next storm.

As with past years, there’s a lot to unpack from the last 12 months.

Here we go again.

# Everything is Burning

In the last 2 years, everything has turned upside down in the world of content and SEO.

Back in 2020, we made a big decision to re-position the agency. (See post history)

We decided to narrow our focus to our most successful, profitable, and consistent segment of clients and re-work our entire operation to focus on serving them.

We defined our ICP as:

* \~Series A ($10mm+ funding) with 6-12 months runway to scale organic as a channel
* Product-led company with “simple” sales cycle involving fewer stakeholders
* Demonstrable opportunity to use SEO to drive business growth

Our services:

* Content focused on growing organic search (SEO)
* Full-service engagements that included research, planning, writing, design, reporting

And our engagement structure:

* Engaged directly with an executive; ownership over strategy and day-to-day execution
* 1-2 points of contact or stakeholders
* Strategic partner that drives business growth (not a service vendor who makes content)

Most importantly, we decided that we were no longer going to offer a broader range of content that we used to sell. That included everything from thought leadership content to case studies and ebooks.

We doubled-down on “SEO content” for product-led SaaS companies.

And this worked phenomenally for us.

We started bringing on more clients than ever.

We developed a lot of internal system and processes that helped us scale and take on more work than we’ve ever had and drive great outcomes for our ideal clients.

But in 2023 and 2024, things started going awry.

One big change, of course, was the rise of AI. Many companies and executives (and writers) feel that AI can write content just as well as an agency like ours. That made it a lot harder to sell a $10,000 per month engagement when they feel like the bulk of the work could be “done for free.”

(Lots of thoughts on this if you want my opinions.)

But it wasn’t just that. Google also started tinkering with their algorithm, introducing new features like AI Overviews, and generally changing the rules of the game.

This created 3 big shifts in our world:

1. The perceived value of content (especially “SEO content”) dropped dramatically in many people’s minds because of AI’s writing capabilities
2. SEO became less predictable as a source of traffic and revenue
3. It’s harder than ever for startups and smaller companies to rank for valuable keywords (let alone generate any meaningful traffic or revenue from them)

The effect?

The middle of the content market has hollowed out.

People—like us—providing good, human-crafted content aimed on driving SEO growth saw a dramatic decline in demand.

We felt it all year.

Fewer and fewer leads.

The leads we did see usually scoffed at our prices. They were indexing us against the cost of content mills and mass-produced AI articles.

It was a time of soul-searching and looking for a way forward.

I spent the first half of the year convinced that the only way to survive was to run toward the fire.

*We have to build our own AI workflows.*

*We have to cut our rates internally.*

*We have to get faster and cheaper to stay competitive with the agencies offering the same number of deliverables for a fraction of our rates.*

*It’s the only way forward.*

But then I asked myself a question…

**Is this the game I actually want to play?**

As an entrepreneur, do I want to run a business where I’m competing mostly on price and efficiency rather than quality and value?

Do I want to hop into a race toward cheaper and cheaper content?

Do I want to help people chase a dwindling amount of organic traffic that’s shrinking in value?

No.

That’s not the game I want to play.

That’s not a business I want to run.

I don’t want to be in the content mill business.

So I decided to turn the wheel—again.

# Repositioning Part II: Electric Boogaloo

What do you do when the whole world shifts around you and the things that used to work aren’t working anymore?

You pivot.

You re-position the business and move in another direction.

So that’s what we decided to do.

Again.

There was only one problem: I honestly wasn’t sure what opportunities existed in the content marketing industry outside of what we were already doing.

We lived in a little echo chamber of startups and SEO.

It felt like the whole market was on fire and I had fight through the smoke to find an escape hatch.

So I started making calls.

Good ol’ fashioned market research.

I reached out to a few dozen marketing and content leaders at a bunch of different companies. I got on the phone and just asked lots of questions about their content programs, their goals, and their pain points.

I wanted to understand what was happening in the market and how we could be valuable.

And, luckily, this process really paid off.

I learned a lot about the fragmentation happening across content and how views were shifting. I noticed key trends and how our old target market really wasn’t buying what we were selling.

* Startups and small companies are no longer willing to invest in an agency like ours. If they were doing content and SEO at all, they were focused entirely on using AI to scale output and minimize costs. VC money is still scarce and venture-backed companies are more focused on profitability than pure growth and raising another round.
* Larger companies (\~500+ employees) are doing more content than ever and drowning in content production. They want to focus on strategy but can barely tread water keeping up with content requests from sales, demand gen, the CEO, and everyone else.
* Many of the companies still investing in content are looking at channels and formats outside of SEO. Things like thought leadership, data reports, interview-driven content, and more. They see it as a way to stand out from the crowd of “bland SEO content.”
* Content needs are constantly in flux. They range from data reports and blog posts to product one-pagers. The idea of a fixed-scope retainer is a total mismatch for the needs of most companies.

All of this led to the logical conclusion:

*We were talking to the* ***wrong people*** *about the* ***wrong things***\*.\*

Many companies came to one of two logical conclusions:

1. SEO is a risky bet, so it’s gotta be a moonshot—super-low cost with a possibility for a big upside (i.e., use AI to crank out lots of content. If it works, great. If it doesn’t, then at least we aren’t out much money.)
2. SEO is a risky bet, so we should diversify into other strategies and channels to drive growth (i.e., shift our budget from SEO and keyword-focused content to video, podcasts, thought leadership, social, etc)

Unless we were going to lean into AI and dramatically cut our costs and rates, our old buyers weren’t interested.

And the segment of the market that needs our help most are looking primarily for production support across a big range of content types. They’re not looking for a team to run a full-blown program focused entirely on SEO.

So we had to go back to the drawing board.

I’ve written before about our basic approach to repositioning the business. But, ultimately it comes down to identifying our unique strengths as a team and then connecting them to needs in the market.

After reviewing the insights from my discussions and taking another hard look at our business and our strengths, I decided on a new direction:

* Move upmarket: Serve mid-size to enterprise businesses with \~500-5,000 employees instead of startups
* Focus on content that supports a broader range of business goals instead of solely on SEO and organic growth (e.g., sales, demand gen, brand, etc)
* Shift back to our broader playbook of content deliverables, including thought leadership, data studies, and more
* Focus on content execution and production to support an internally-directed content strategy across multiple functions

In a way, it’s sort of a reverse-niche move. Rather than zooming in specifically on driving organic growth for startups, we want to be more of an end-to-end content production partner that solves issues of execution and operations for all kinds of content teams.

It’s early days, but the response here has been promising.

We’ve seen an uptick in leads through Q4. And more companies in our pipeline fit the new ICP. They’re bigger, often have more budget. (But they move more slowly).

We should know by the end of the quarter if this maneuver is truly paying off.

Hopefully, this will work out. Hopefully our research and strategy are right and we’ll find a soft landing serving a different type of client.

If it doesn’t?

Then it will be time to make some harder decisions. As I already mentioned, I’m not interested in the race to the bottom of AI content. And if that’s the only game left in town, then it might be time to think hard about a much bigger change.

To be done:

* Build new content playbooks for expanded deliverables
* Build new showcase page for expanded deliverables

# Retooling the Operation

It’s easy to say we’re doing something new.

It’s a lot harder to actually do it—and do it well.

Beyond just changing our positioning, we have to do open-heart surgery on the entire content operation behind the scenes.

We need to create new systems that work for a broader range of content types, formats, and goals.

Here’s the first rub: **All of our workflows are tooled specifically for SEO-focused content.**

Every template, worksheet, and process that we’ve built and scaled in the last 5 years assumes that the primary goal of every piece of content is SEO.

Even something as simple as requiring a target keyword is a blocker in a world where we’re *not* entirely focused on SEO.

This is relatively easy to fix, but it requires several key changes:

* Update content calendars to make keywords optional
* Update workflows to determine whether we need an optimization report for each deliverable

Next, **we need to break down the deliverables into parts rather than a single line item.**

In our old system, we would plan content as a single row in a Content Calendar spreadsheet.

It was a really wide sheet with lots of fields where we’d define the dimensions of each individual article.

This was very efficient and simple to follow.

But every article had the same overall scope when it came to the workflow.

In Asana (our project management tool), all of the steps in the creation were strung together in a single task. We would create a few basic templates for each client, and then each piece would flow through the same steps:

* Briefing
* Writing
* Editing
* Design
* etc.

If we had anything that didn’t fit into the “standard” workflow, we’d just tag it in the calendar with an unofficial notation \[USING BRACKETS\].

It *worked*. But it wasn’t ideal.

Now we need the steps to be more modular.

Imagine, for example, a client asks us to create a mix of deliverables:

* 1 article with writing + design
* 1 content brief
* 1 long-form ebook with an interview + writing + design

Each of these would require its own steps and its own workflow.

We need to break down the work to accommodate for a wider variety of workflows and variables.

This means we need to update the fields and structure of our calendar to accommodate for the new dimensions—while also keeping the planning process simple and manageable.

This leads to the next challenge: The number of “products” that we’re offering could be almost infinite. Just looking at the example scope above, you can mix and match all of these different building blocks to create a huge variety of different types of work, each requiring its own workflow.

This is part of the reason we pivoted away from this model to focus on a productized, SEO-focused content service back in 2020.

Take something as simple as a case study.

On the surface, it seems like one deliverable that can be easily scoped and priced, right?

Well, unpack what goes into a case study:

* Is there already source material from the customer or do we need to conduct an interview?
* How long is it? Is it a short overview case study or a long-form narrative?
* Does it need images and graphics? How many?

Each of these variables opens up 2-3 possibilities. And when you combine them, we end up with something like 10 possible permutations for this single type of deliverable.

It gets a bit messy.

But not only do we have to figure out how to scope and price all for all of these variables, we also have to figure out how to account for these variables in the execution. We have to specify—for every deliverable—what type it is, how long, which steps are involved and not involved, the timeline for delivery, and all of the other factors.

*We’re approaching infinite complexity, here.*

We have to figure out a system that allows for a high level of flexibility to serve the diverse needs of our clients but is also productized enough that we can build workflows, process, and templates to deliver the work.

I’ve spent the last few months designing that system.

# Failed Attempt #1: Ultra-Productization

In my first pass, I tried to make it as straight forward as possible.

Just sit down, make a list of all of the possible deliverables we could provide and then assign them specific scopes and services.

Want a case study?

Okay that’ll include an interview, up to 2,000 words of content, and 5 custom graphics.

It costs $X.

But this solution quickly fell apart when we started testing it against real-world scenarios.

What if the client provided the brief instead of us creating one?

What if they didn’t want graphics?

What if this particular case study really needs to be 3,000 words but all of the others should be 2,000?

In order for this system to work, we’d need to individual scope and price all of these permutations of each productized service. Then we’d need to somehow keep track of all of these and make sure that we accurately scope, price, and deliver them across dozens of clients.

It’s sort of like a restaurant handling food allergies by creating separate versions of every single dish to account for every individual type of allergy.

Most restaurants have figured out that it makes way more sense to have a “standard” and an “allergy-free” version. Then you only need 2 options to cover 100% of the cases.

Onto the next option.

# Failed Attempt #2: Deliverable-Agnostic Services

Next, I sat down with my head of Ops, Katy, to try to map it out.

We took a big step back and said: *Why does the deliverable itself even matter?*

At the end of the day, what we’re selling is just a few types of work (research, writing, editing, design, etc) that can be packaged up in an infinite number of ways.

*Rather than try to define deliverables, shouldn’t we leave it open ended for maximum flexibility?*

From there, we decided to break down everything into ultra-modular building blocks.

We started working on this super complex system of modular deliverables where we would have services like writing, design, editing, etc—plus a sliding scale for different scopes like the length of writing or the number of images.

In theory, it would allow us to mix and match *any* combination of services to create custom deliverables for the client.

In fact, we wanted the work to be deliverable-agnostic.

That way we could mold it to fit any client’s needs and deliver any type of content, regardless of the format or goal.

Want a 5,000-word case study with 15 custom graphics? That’ll be $X.

Want a 2,000-word blog post with an interview and no visuals? $Y.

Just want us to create 10 briefs, you handle the writing, and we do design? It’s $Z.

Again, this feels like a reasonable solution.

But it quickly spiraled out of amuck.

(That’s an Office reference.)

For this to work, we need to have *incredibly* precise scoping process for every single deliverable. Before we can begin work (or even quote a price), we need to know pretty much the exact word count of the final article, for example.

In the real world? This almost never happens.

The content is as long as the content needs to be.

Clients rarely know if the blog post should be 2,000 words or 3,000 words. They just want good content.

We have a general ballpark, but we can rarely dial it in within just 1,000 words until we’ve done enough research to create the brief.

Plus, from a packaging and pricing perspective, it introduces all kind of weird scenarios where clients will owe exactly $10,321 for this ultra-specific combination of services.

We were building an open system that could accommodate any and all types of potential deliverables.

On the face that seems great because it makes us incredibly flexible.

In reality, the ambiguity actually works against us. It makes it harder for us to communicate to clients clearly about what they’ll get, how much it will cost, and how long it will take.

That, of course, also means that it hurts our client relationships.

(This actually kind of goes back to my personal learnings, which I’ll mention in a bit. I tend to be a “let’s leave things vague so we don’t have to limit our options” kind of person. But I’m working on fixing this to be more precise, specific, and clear in everything that we do.)

# Dialing It In: Building a Closed System

We were trying to build an *open* system.

We need to build a *closed* system.

We need to force clarity and get specific about what we do, what we don’t do, and how much it all costs.

Then we need a system to expand on that closed system—add new types of deliverables, new content playbooks, and new workflows if and when the need arises.

With that in mind, we can start by mapping out the key dimensions of any type of deliverable that we would ever want to deliver.

These are the universal dimensions that determine the scope, workflow, and price of any deliverable—regardless of the specific type output.

Dimensions are:

* Brief scope
* Writing + editing scope
* Design scope
* Interview scope
* Revision (rounds)

Scope, essentially, just tells us how *many* words, graphics, interviews, etc are required for the content we’re creating.

In our first crack at the system, we got super granular with these scopes.

But to help force a more manageable system, we realized that we didn’t need tiny increments for most of this work. Instead, we just need boundaries—you pay $X for *up to* Y words.

We still need *some* variability around the scope of these articles. Obviously, most clients won’t be willing to pay the same price for a 1,000-word article as a 10,000-word article. But we can be smarter about the realistic break points.

We boiled it down to the most common ranges:

* (Up to) 250 words
* 1,000 words
* 3,000 words
* 6,000 words
* 10,000 words

This gives us a much more manageable number of variables.

But we still haven’t exactly *closed* the system.

We need one final dimension: Deliverable *type*.

This tells us what we’re actually building with these building blocks.

This is how we’ll put a cap on the potentially infinite number of combinations we could offer. The deliverable type will define what the final product should look like (e.g., blog post, case study, ebook, etc).

And it will also give us a way to put standards and expectations around different types of deliverables that we want to offer.

Then we can expand on this list of deliverables to offer new services.

In the mean time, only the deliverables that we have already defined are, “on the menu,” so to speak.

If a client comes to us and asks for something like a podcast summary article (which we don’t currently offer), we’ll have to either say we can’t provide that work or create a new deliverable type and define the dimensions of that specific piece.

But here’s the kicker: No matter the deliverable type, it has to still fit within the scopes we’ve already defined. And the pricing will be the same.

This means that if you’re looking for our team to write up to 1,000 words of content, it costs the same amount—whether it’s a blog post, an ebook, a LinkedIn post, or anything else.

Rather than trying to retool our entire system to offer this new podcast summary article deliverable, we’ll just create the new deliverable type, add it to the list of options, and it’s ready to sell with the pre-defined dimensions we’ve already identified.

To do:

* Update onboarding workflow
* Update contracts and scope documents
* Dial in new briefing process

# Know Thyself

For the last year, I’ve been going through personal therapy.

(Huge shout out to my wife, Laura, for her support and encouragement throughout the process.)

It’s taught me a lot about myself and my tendencies. It’s helped me find some of my weaknesses and think about how I can improve as a person, as a partner, and as an entrepreneur.

And it’s forced me to face a lot of hard truths.

For example, consider some of the critical decisions I’ve made for my business:

* Unconventional freelance “collective” model
* No formal management structure
* Open-ended retainers with near-infinite flexibility
* General contracts without defined scope
* “Take it or leave it” approach to sales and marketing

Over the years, I’ve talked about almost everything on this list as a huge advantage.

I saw these things as a reflection of how I wanted to do things differently and better than other companies.

But now, I see them more as a reflection of my fears and insecurities.

*Why did I design my business like this?*

Why do I want so much “flexibility” and why do I want things left open-ended rather than clearly defined?

One reason that could clearly explain it:

***I’m avoidant.***

If you’re not steeped in the world of therapy, this basically means that my fight or flight response gets turned all the way to “flight.”

If I’m unhappy or uncomfortable, my gut reaction is usually to withdraw from the situation.

I see commitment and specificity as a prelude to future conflict.

And I avoid conflict whenever possible.

So I built my business to minimize it.

If I don’t have a *specific* schedule of work that I’m accountable for delivering, then we can fudge the numbers a bit and hope they even out in the end.

If I don’t set a *specific* standard for the length of an article, then I don’t have to let the client know when their request exceeds that limit.

*Conflict*….*avoided*?

Now, that’s not to say that everything I’ve built was wrong or bad. There is a lot of value in having flexibility in your business.

For example, I would say that our flexible retainers are, overall, an advantage.

Clients have changing needs.

Having flexibility to quickly adapt to those needs can be a huge value add.

And not everything can be clearly defined upfront (at least not without a massive amount of time and work just to decide how long to write an article).

Overly-rigid structures and processes can be just as problematic as loosey-goosey ones.

But, on the whole, I realized that my avoidant tendencies and laissez faire approach to management have left a vacuum in many areas.

The places where I avoided specificity were often the places where there was the most confusion, uncertainty, and frustration from the team and from clients.

People simply didn’t know what to expect or what was expected of them.

Ironically, this often *creates* the conflict I’m trying to avoid.

For example, if I don’t give feedback to people on my team, then they feel uneasy about their work. Or they make assumptions about expectations that don’t match what I’m actually expecting. Then the client might get upset, I might get upset, and our team members may be upset.

Conflict definitely *not* avoided.

This happens on the client side, too. If we don’t define a specific timeline when something will be delivered, the client might expect it sooner than we can deliver—creating frustration when we don’t meet *their* expectation.

This conflict actually would have been avoided if we set clearer expectations upfront.

But we didn’t do that.

*I* didn’t do that.

So it’s time to step up and close the gaps.

# Stepping Up and Closing the Gaps

If I’m going to address these gaps and create more clarity and stability, I have to step up.

Both personally and professionally.

I have to actually face the fear and uncertainty that drives me to be avoidant.

And then apply that to my business in meaningful ways that aren’t cop-out ways of kinda-sorta providing structure without really doing it. I’ve gotta be all in.

This means:

* Fill the gaps where I rely on other people to do things that aren’t really their job but I haven’t put someone in place to do it
* Set and maintain expectations about our internal work processes, policies, and standards
* Define clear boundaries on things like roles, timelines, budgets, and scopes

Now, this isn’t going to happen overnight.

And just because I say that I need to step up to close these gaps doesn’t mean that I need to be the one who’s responsible for them (at least not forever).

It just means that, as the business leader, I need to make sure the gaps get filled—by me or by someone else who has been specifically charged with owning that part of the operation.

So, this is probably my #1 focus over the coming quarter.

And it starts by identifying the gaps that exist. Then, step into those gaps myself, pay someone else to fill that role, or figure out how to eliminate the gap another way.

This means going all the way back to the most basic decisions in our business.

One of the foundational things about Optimist is being a “different kind” of agency.

I always wanted to build something that solved for the bureaucracy, hierarchy, and siloed structure of agencies.

*If a client has feedback, they should be able to talk directly to the person doing the work rather than going through 3 layers of account management and creative directors.*

So I tried to be clever.

I tried to design all kinds of systems and processes that eliminated these middle rungs.

(In retrospect, what I was actually doing was designing a system that played into my avoidant tendencies and made it easy to abdicate responsibility for lots of things.)

Since we didn’t want to create hierarchy, we never implemented things like Junior and Senior roles. We never hired someone to manage or direct the individual creatives. We didn’t have Directors or VPs.

(Hell, we barely had a project manager for the first several years of existence.)

This aversion to hierarchy aligned with our values around elevating ownership and collective contribution.

I still believe in the value a flat structure.

But a flat structure doesn’t eliminate the complexity of a growing business.

No one to review writers and give them 1:1 feedback?

I guess I’ll just have to do that….*when I have some spare time.*

No Content Director?

Okay, well someone needs to manage our content playbooks and roll out new ones. *Just add it to my task list.*

**Our flat structure didn’t eliminate the need for these roles.**

**It just eliminated the people to do them.**

All of those unfilled roles ultimately fell back on me or our ops person, Katy.

Of course, this isn’t the first time we’ve recognized this.

We’ve known there were growing holes in our business as it’s gotten bigger and more complex.

Over the years, we’ve experimented with different ways to solve for it.

# The Old Solution: Distributed Ops

One system we designed was a “distributed ops” framework.

Basically, we had one person who was the head of ops (at the time, we considered anything that was non-client-facing to be “ops”). They’d plan and organize all of the various things that needed to happen around Optimist.

Then they’d assign out the work to whoever was able to help.

We had a whole system for tying this into the our profit share and even gave people “Partner” status based on their contributions to ops.

It worked—kinda.

One big downfall is that all of the tasks and projects were ad hoc.

People would pick up jobs, but they didn’t have much context or expertise to apply. So the output often varied.

Since we were trying to maintain a flat structure, there was minimal oversight or management of the work.

In other words, we didn’t always get the best results.

But, more importantly, we still didn’t close all of the gaps entirely. Because everything was an ad-hoc list of tasks and projects, we never really had the “big picture” view of everything that needed to be done across the business.

This also meant we rarely had clarity on what was important, what was trivial, and what was critical.

We need a better system.

# Stop Reinventing the Wheel (And Create a Damn Org Chart)

It’s time to get serious about filling the gaps in our business.

It can’t be a half-fix or an ad hoc set of projects and tasks.

We need clarity on the roles that need to be filled and then fill them.

The first step here is to create an org chart.

A real one.

Map out all of the jobs that need to be done for Optimist to be successful besides just writers and designers.

Roles like:

* Content director
* Design director
* SEO manager
* Reporting
* Finance
* Account management
* Business development
* Sales
* Marketing
* Project management

It feels a bit laughable listing all of these roles.

Because most are either empty or have my name attached to them.

And that’s the problem.

I can’t do everything.

And all of the empty roles are gaps in our structure—places where people aren’t getting the direction, feedback, or guidance they need to do their best work. Or where things just aren’t being done consistently.

Content director, for example, should be responsible for steering the output of our content strategists, writers, and editors.

They’re not micromanaging every deliverable.

But they give feedback, set overall policy, and help our team identify opportunities to get better.

Right now we don’t have anyone in that role. Which means it’s my job—*when I have time*.

Looking at the org chart (a real org chart that I actually built to help with this), it’s plain as day how many roles look like this.

Even if we aren’t going to implement a traditional agency structure and a strict hierarchy, we still need to address these gaps.

And the only way for that to happen is face the reality and then create a plan to close the gaps.

Now that we have a list of theoretical roles, we need to clearly define the responsibilities and boundaries of those roles to make sure they cover everything that actually needs to happen.

Then we can begin the process of delegating, assigning, hiring, and otherwise addressing each one.

So that’s what I need to do.

To be done:

* Create job descriptions for all of the roles we need to fill
* Hire Biz Dev role
* Hire Account Lead role(s)
* Hire Head of Content

# Playing Offense

As we move into Q1 of 2025 and I reflect on the tumultuous few years we’ve had, one thought keeps running through my head.

*We need to play offense.*

Most of the last 1-2 years was reacting to changes that were happening around us.

Trying to make sense and chart a new path forward.

Reeling.

But what I really want—as a person and as an entrepreneur—is to be proactive.

I want to think and plan ahead.

Figure out where we want to go before we’re forced to change course by something that’s out of our control.

So my overarching focus for Q1 is playing offense.

Thinking longer term.

Getting ahead of the daily deluge and creating space to be more proactive, innovative, and forward thinking.

To do:

* Pilot new content formats
* Audit and update our own content strategy
* Improve feedback workflows
* Build out long-term roadmap for 1-2 years for Optimist

# Final Note on Follow-Through and Cadence

In my reflection this year, one of the things I’ve realized is how helpful these posts are for me.

I process by writing.

So I actually end up making a lot of decisions and seeing things more clearly each time I sit down to reflect and write my yearly recap.

It also gives me a space to hold myself accountable for the things I said I would do.

So, I’m doing two things a bit differently from here on out.

First: I’m identifying clear action items that I’m holding myself accountable for getting done in the next 3 months (listed in the above sections).

In each future update, I’ll do an accounting of what I got done and what wasn’t finished (and why).

Second: I’m going to start writing shorter quarterly updates.

This will gives me more chances each year to reflect, process, and make decisions. Plus it gives me a shorter feedback loop for the action items that I identified above.

(See—playing offense.)

Entrepreneur,surviving my job,Friend wants to start a business with me but...,"So as I stated in previous posts, I've been unemployed for the last 8 years. I live with my parents to do gig work to survive. I knew that I probably wouldn't start a successful company because if I can't get a job what makes me think that I'm going to be able to start a successful company? Unfortunately I believe that it's true the reason that I can't get a job is going to be a reason why I won't be successful, so when this person approached me about a potential Business partnership I felt a little startled. I mean it's been so long since I had a 9 to 5:00 what makes me think I'll be able to successfully start a company with someone? I'm tired of doing gig work, and I really do need more money but at the same time I'm wondering if this is even realistic when it comes to my current circumstances.

Entrepreneur,don't know what to do with my life,100+ days of 18-hour coding sessions and I'm still broke,">**TLDR:** Started coding March 22nd to escape being broke. Work 18-20 hours daily in complete chaos. toxic family, power outages, broken computer, $0 budget. Built 12+ apps that don't work, tried every Twitter strategy, applied for gigs, still at $0 MRR. Built 7 simple tools in 2 days recently. Just need $10/day ($300/month) to prove this works. Every day feels like decay but not stopping.

I started this journey on March 22, 2025. It started as just an unserious decision not something that I really expected to work. It was just a very unserious and uncertain decision because I had the idea that I would still not continue. I would just try it out. So I just wrote on the very first piece of paper that I saw on my desk and just wrote ""March 22"" inside it. I did not write it on a calendar. I did not post about it because I didn't expect it to really work. It was a decision, but it still had the vulnerability of me not continuing or not proceeding.

Before that, I was completely down. The situation in the house (family) is just so bad. I even started cleaning the whole house itself, rearranging things. And then I had this moment 'okay, now it's done, what should I do?' I read this book, The One Thing by Gary Keller, and it really drove me to write about things. I soon discovered ethankeiser on Instagram and saw that, oh shit, programming is actually a bigger world, different personalities and not the one i expected it to be. theres also more freedom to build a lot of different apps depends on ur idea. I also was always watching Joma Tech that's why I became very passionate with data science and all that.

One of the very very first projects I had in mind and was one of the reasons I continued this journey was because I struggled with a video game I played and wanted to build a tool and the tool is supposed to help me improve in the game. And yeah that's that. I started to learn more about API's and H TTP Requests etc. and built my very first ever prototype.

Around April was a tough time for me because it was the time when I learned how to really work. I learned a lot of meta skills. That was the time when things were really tough because I really dealt with my procrastination habits, my sidetracking. I really learned a lot about myself and the way I make so many excuses.

The first tweet that I sent out and the first buy me a coffee and ko-fi post that I sent out was on May 4 or 5 (also linkedin and wait reddit too i think).

Ever since March 22, I've been working (learning and building and dealing with my bad brain programming) like 16 hours every day. And then it improved even more to 18 to 20 hours per day. And sometimes once every 2 weeks, or like biweekly, I end up working 24 to 26 hours straight because:

* I work while I eat
* I tweet while I take a shit
* No breaks, no massage, no eating outside
* No eating out, no reward
* No such thing as trying to be comforted or complaining
* Drama happens, after 5-30 seconds I move on and do work. Some residue still left but focus is priortity
* Sister rage-baits and power-tripping I sometimes ignore. She really believes she's the one in control cause she has money but my philosophy changed over time.

The reason why I think I kept moving forward is because I did not do all those things. Those things are slow stoppers. Actually got $0 MRR. We're not stopping till we make it. 📢📢📢

The place I live in is trash. The people are worse. They keep yelling. They keep shouting. They're very noisy. Sometimes you get desensitized by it. Sometimes you get used to it. But I always know the difference between midnight and morning because the morning quiet is very different than the midnight quiet. But sometimes even at midnight, problems still try to sneak in. My sister is trying to burn something, and then the smoke trying to reach your window. And then I smell it. It's bad. And sometimes there's like construction work on her apartment at like 12 midnight to 1 AM. Like, what the fuck? It's very noisy.

The worst times is when it's raining because not only is it noisy, but there's like leaks on the roof or in ceiling. And, you know, at that time, like, the internet kinda slows down. But yeah, sometimes I think of it in a good way where oh, shit. It's raining. It's much better that it's raining because people outside are in their homes. Quiet. There's no one outside. That's good.

I don't respond because what the fuck did I just do? I was just focused on my work. The thing was already hard to deal with because it's already noisy, but I desensitized myself from it. But then another thing pops up and there's like another layer of challenge. It's funny.

But despite all that, I build mobile apps, learn tools, debug, email, tweet, all from this garbage setup that I have. AMD Ryzen 3 computer, the monitor didn't display liek 2 months ago and after 2 days of fixing (This is the time where I learned NeoVim because I started coding on my phone. Learned Tmux, applied for a debt thing for a mobile data thing. and used it to watch a NVim guide and learn to use it for my phone.)

There was one time where my pc was broken cause of this and at the same time no internet, I just used my emulator that I already had since I can still use the ethernet cable, the ISP just disconnected it but there's still like small internet access if you do it right. I can't open websites but I can search google inside that Android Studio Phone.

continuation of 2 days of fixing... -> 2 days of fixing the thing, the pc all by myself just 2 days of debugging and troublechuting i realized i just had to remove GPU and now PC slow.

* The neighbors yell, cars blast with sudden noises that shock you not the normal vroom car noise.
* There were 6 to 8 internet outages in June only and 3 power outages.
* I had like 6 different setup changes because I can't live with this computer positioned in just one space.
* I tried to set it up as a standing desk.
* I tried lying down to treat it like as if it is a laptop.

Because sometimes when I do NPM or PNPM install, it takes a lot of time. So sometimes I do some things in the background or I do push ups here and there, or sometimes I just lie down and plan things out, whatever I want to do afterwards. But if I just had a laptop, I would just bring that computer and just fucking lie down and still write some code until I sleep.

I've learned I can work while being very hungry, while sleepy, anxious, angry (there was only one time when I can't take it which was May 31 where I just used the money I should be using to buy tools for food because my hands were shaking I was sweating even with a fan facing directly 2 inches from me and my mind was uneasy, I was reading documentation at that time and I just can't pick up any info and things just doesn't work and I don't understand stuff, my brain felt really slow like what you feel when doing a lot of push ups you feel a muscle being slow). I don't get sad usually, I just don't want to be and I usually don't feel it cause I'm too busy doing stuff.

Learned to start the day whenever I want. Not when noise wakes me up. Because sometimes I try to have a neat straight sleep, but my REM sleep gets disturbed because a neighbor yells or a car honks or whatever. And then I wake up at a time I don't want to. Like, you just got 4 or 5 hours of sleep, and then guess what happens throughout the day. But I learned that I will start the day whenever I decide. So I do pushups, sometimes you gotta really make shit up since your brain makes shit up. Like if your brain tells you your day is gonna be ruined cause a car honk woke you up then do 5-10 push ups and say after doing that your day will reset and you get to decide how and when you start your day.

When I sleep, it's because I literally can't function anymore. Sometimes I sleep during YC Startup School or some database guide videos. When I wake up after 2 to 3 hours of sleep, I continue working until 4 to 5 AM after that. Because I just saved up so much energy. It felt like necessity.

I've tried every strategy on Twitter:

* Reply guy tactics
* Anime girl profile picture
* Engaged with people, shared stories
* Posted to communities, joined calls and spaces
* DM strategy, trying to get editing gigs from Reddit

Nothing really worked. Like, everything I tried. Posting on buy me a coffee, Ko-fi, Patreon. I did all this stuff, but all I learned was I was just busy, and I did not really work on the right things. I even fell into the Twitter trap. I was even mad at myself because now I spend so much time on Twitter, and I get so addicted with everything that is inside it. I sometimes forget to build. I tried automation to still post on Twitter while building. And I already spent 2 weeks. 2 weeks of 16 hours to 18 hours workdays with no breaks just to learn automation. Anyways, nothing really worked. Tweets don't make it. I don't understand why my tweets don't make it. Numbers don't move. I'm at 1,294 tweets now. I even purchased X premium for it.

I tried all the payment platforms.

* Stripe -> (After a week I discovered it's not available in my country. Spent 2 days (the very first thing I do after I wake up feet cold (because that's what they say do what you should do as the very first thing in the morning you do or whatever the fuck that means)) contacting support and trying to integrate to my app etc. etc.
* PayPal (tried it for a week, it was working but the navigation was so confusing but I managed to make it work -> my fault to find another shiny thing another tool that says better payments etc.)
* Paddle -> I forgot but I think it was country issues or integration issues
* Lemon Squeezy -> they emailed me that they we're not blablabla anyways I can't use it
* Polar -> skill issues, i spent 3 weeks trying to integrate it I just don't understand. (this is my fault and responsibility)

Some didn't work. PayPal is not good for developers. And the payment processing there is kind of bad. I even applied for Coding Sloth and sent 2 samples for editing. Still got rejected.

For authentication

* NextAuth
* Clerk
* Better-Auth

Database

* Self-host Supabase
* Prisma ORM
* Supabase cloud
* Neon
* Drizzle ORM
* PostgreSQL

I learned respect when trying to apply for work because you start to think your rates and you name your price and I see people naming prices that were higher than what I expect and my perception about the value of time changed. Because I did very challenging stuff for free such as volunteering work and even for work that has pay, they let you do extra work for less money, and I did a lot of work for free that shouldn't actually be.

Even in application (for video editing) I would pay someone just for making efforts for test edits.

I also love emailing support teams of tools I use such as Stripe (Stripe support is the best) or Discord or whatever.

After I learned that, I just notice when someone doesn't value time. Family talks to me like they were really kings of the world and they introduce ideas like 'life isn't this and that, it's this.' 'this is what reality is' bullshit. when all they did was make life harder for us. I heard their stories, I learned about their history and their true characters. They're a bunch of jerk-offs.

# Some stuff

* I tried paying for Cursor AI. My card got declined. Only there. Everywhere else, it worked. I tried different cards, cleared cache, everything that they said.
* Expo Go isn't acting up. My PC is too slow to even test things locally properly. I tried fixing it, couldn't. I didn't cook, didn't watch movies, don't go on IG, don't cry on TikTok. I do push ups here and there, stretch, and go back to building.
* Sometimes I wake up hoping there's a Ko-fi or buy me a coffee donation. Instead, it's just those emails where Ko-fi posts ""$250 for doing this challenge!"" or some other things. Like, I always expect it. The kind of wake up that feels like you're late for work, but it's just nothing. It's a mix of hope and then disappointment. For payment stuff, I've been trying to get Stripe Atlas and register an LLC. I work through every step. Nothing is handed. Every workaround I find I earn through time and frustration.

Every tool I use, I've had problems with it at some point. I work hard to find a workaround. Every new thing I learn, I grind through confusion and trial and error. Every bug I fix, every tool that finally works, it gives me this weird mix of excitement and dread because now people might start showing up, start clinging, start claiming they were there when they weren't. I get anxious about success and not failure because if things start working, I already know how people react. They think you owe them something. They leech. They project. I've seen it in small ways already.

I face all those struggles, and it feels so discouraging and demotivating because you've done all the right things. You know those motivational videos that say, keep pushing through, keep working. Sometimes I even get past those. I even outwork those people. But sometimes why the fuck did I not make any money out of it? I know I work a lot. I know I have immense self awareness, and I really wanted to learn and grow. And sometimes, when I ask about it, I get told that my problem is too much learning and not building, so I adapted that kind of mindset, so I built more tools. I built 7 tools in 2 days. And then now what?

It's like every single reason that it should work is there:

* The personal struggles
* The problem solving mentality
* The perseverance, persistence
* All the micro skills involved
* I didn't use any money for it, used free tools
* I don't even get massages

Every day is decay. Every day, it gets harder. I don't get breaks. I don't get like, ""okay, congratulations on dealing with this, now you get to have a vacation."" No. There's none of that. And even with that approach I make $0 from it. I had all the reason to be what. I outworked every single motivational guru out there.

When I started, I had motivations for myself that I don't need to make a million dollars from my apps. I just need $10 per day for a breakthrough. That would be my breakthrough. It's $10 per day. How much is that? That's $300 monthly recurring revenue or like profit or whatever. I would already be happy with that. But it's like, what the fuck? I tried video editing gigs, tried DMing people, I tried this strategy and that. I've DMed a lot of people on Twitter. I've joined a lot of communities. I joined hackathons and all that shit. But right now, I'm still struggling while also building. I built like already 10 to 12 apps. Some don't work. Some are deployed and I only had enough money for one domain. And I bought that domain for one tool I made which I don't fucking know if it works. But anyways, it's not even a gamble. It just feels like decay. There's no gamble with it. There's no risk. I'm not in that world anymore.

I get so confused. Like, what the fuck is wrong with my strategy? I've already done like a lot of marketing and all that. The metric that I am trying to really see is how much money I've made and I made $0 out of all the work I put in. Sometimes I even try to move on from Twitter because maybe the right strategy is to not think abt it and just tweet all the time and to stop checking the analytics page all the time. Because there are real metrics that I should be thinking about, like 'what would people pay for?' 'how many already visited my site?' 'how many users do i have?' and all that shit.

It feels like I've already done everything. I'm so confused right now.

I tried the tactical route, following a lot of people with the hopes of them following back, automation, then I started to be really authentic, I started to sound like Nizzy, haydendevs, YacineMTB where they just tweet random stuff, I became a motivational guy, Reply and follow web3 gm people etc.

Now I'm still very very open to learning new things. Maybe my approach is still bad. Maybe I'm still treating easy things as challenging or hard or there should still be much more stuff I should be doing and things to improve on. Maybe my story is biased. Maybe this and that. Maybe I should spend more time on reddit than twitter. Maybe I should stop doing X and Y and start doing more of this and that.

In all honesty, I love what I do. I love programming. I did not do this when I was younger but every night before I sleep I always feel that I should've started earlier. I did so many things when I was young trying to navigate through life but who am I to judge things happening to me, I focused on school for a reason, I became friends with people I actually don't want to hang around with. But all for a reason. And now I just discovered my interest. Honestly. Every time I open the terminal and all that I just love seeing it, when I code inside IDE I just love doing it. Solving bugs etc. When things work, (you see IShowSpeed or Flight doing the tongue thing and clap their hands. That's how excited I get inside my room at like midnight or something xDD).

I was always into computers back then. When I was 2yrs old, I solved my very first computer problem. ""How do I turn it on?"". My sister tried to mix up the wires to prevent me from using it and I thought, 'Hmm, there should be an input and an output. There should be a place where it comes from and where it leads to. A point A to point B. Then I followed the wire and turned it on.

But most of my time is spent on video games. But I wasn't just playing, I was using cheats downloaded pirated games and tried with the best of my abilities to use things for free. But that habit of researching and constant tweaking and solving problems even for weeks and creating multiple test accounts, creating a VK account asking Russian communities about a tool they made about this game I played etc. Using google translate to communicate with them etc. was already a way of how programming works. Programming amplified that innate ability I had. I like the stress it comes with having so many inside a notepad -> test accounts what worked what didn't etc. etc.

I'm not saying I'm good or skilled or talented, It's just my own version of what good is. In my lens.

But to think about it I actually appreciate many things in life. My family is okay and healthy. Random people actually bring us food, gossip turned into concern and led to decisions of bringing us free food but sometimes i doubt, this might be transactional,

classmates (only 2 of them (different friend groups) but sometimes they bring someone with them too) from before sometimes visit and talk about stuff cause just nothing.

Entrepreneur,don't know what to do with my life,Business Partner is a leech and I don't want him there anymore,"About five years ago, during the height of COVID, a friend of mine approached me to start a fast-casual restaurant. I already had a fully fleshed-out business plan and was planning to move forward with or without help. He offered to put up most of the capital, telling me not to bother with an SBA loan. He promised to be hands-on, a partner in the trenches.

Five years later, I can say with confidence that he doesn't understand a single thing about running a business.

Every meaningful task, every ounce of growth, and every bit of branding has come from me. I manage our social media, build and maintain B2B relationships, design the menu, handle emails, negotiate with the town, organize police fundraisers, and work in the store regularly. I wear every hat. Meanwhile, I am lucky if I see him for more than ten hours across an entire year.

I knew something was off about a year in, when I realized he was spending five hours a day playing video games. Since then, I’ve had real-life emergencies. One close friend died by suicide and my mother required post-surgical care. During both events, I asked him to step in and help. He refused.

The most basic tasks are beyond him. He doesn't know how to run a Facebook ad. He’s never worked a rush. He adds zero operational or strategic value. I asked him what it would take to buy out his 60 percent stake, and the number he gave me was laughable, especially considering we were struggling financially last year.

The reality is, I’m tethered to someone who contributes nothing, takes credit by default, and holds a majority stake in something I’ve built with my sweat and stress.

Has anyone been through something like this? How do you legally and financially separate from someone like this without burning the entire house down?",102,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1kutb7x/business_partner_is_a_leech_and_i_dont_want_him/,1748144487.0,fr3akquencyzer0,1kutb7x,advice_seeking
Entrepreneur,don't know what to do with my life,Someone tried to legally steal my sister's business name. Here's the lesson for all of us.,"**TL;DR: My sister ran a small local gym for years. A stranger tried to trademark her business name to force her to pay them licensing fees. We caught it just in time, but it opened my eyes to a huge risk most small businesses ignore.**

My sister has a small, local gym. It's her life's work. Not a huge company, just a neighborhood place people love. About four years ago, she got a letter that made her stomach drop.

Some person she'd never met had filed a trademark application for her officially unregistered gym's name. The goal was simple: get the trademark, then legally force my sister to pay them royalties to use her own brand.

Basically, legal extortion.

We were lucky. We found out during the ""opposition period."" That's a short window where you can challenge a trademark application. We were able to stop it based on her ""prior use"" of the name. It still cost time and lawyer fees, but it could've been so much worse. If we had missed that window, she would have been in a real nightmare, possibly forced to rebrand the business she spent years building.

This whole thing freaked me out. As a programmer, I started digging into it. And what I found is something I think every entrepreneur should know.

    **You Think The Government Protects You? Think Again.**

You might assume that when someone files for a trademark, the government checks to see if it conflicts with your existing business. In the US, the USPTO does a basic search against its own database, but that's it. They don't check for unregistered businesses (common law trademarks), state registrations, or what's happening in other countries.

And here's the kicker: in most other countries, including a lot of Europe (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and many more), they do **zero** conflict checks. They just register the mark.

**The responsibility is 100% on you, the business owner, to watch for these filings and object before it's too late. Especially if you haven't registered your brand yet.**

Most of us are too busy running our companies to even think about this. We're focused on customers, product, and making payroll. We assume that because we've been using a name, it's ours. Legally, that's not always true.

This isn't some one-in-a-million problem. People are out there actively looking for successful small businesses that haven't registered their trademarks. They file for a few hundred bucks, hoping for a big payday from you.

**The lesson I learned is simple:**

Your brand is your *most valuable asset*, but it's also your most *vulnerable*. You can't protect yourself from a threat you don't even know exists.

I'm sharing this because I see so many people in this sub pouring their hearts into their businesses. I don't want anyone else to get that stomach-dropping letter my sister got.

**So, a question for the community:**

Have any of you ever thought about this? Or had a close call with someone trying to copy or steal your brand? How do you protect what you're building?",133,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1ls2vbe/someone_tried_to_legally_steal_my_sisters/,1751695089.0,elixon,1ls2vbe,advice_seeking
Entrepreneur,don't know what to do with my life,Why I stopped starting businesses with partners and why you should too.,"For a bit of context, I've been an entrepreneur for 22 years now, both on and off the Internet.



I've had salaried phases, solo businesses, others with one partner, others with many partners.



I haven't seen it all.

I haven't experienced everything.



But I'd like to share my experience with you, so that you don't waste years of your life (and your health, by the way).



I started on my own because being an introvert, it was easier for me.



I had to force myself to go and talk to future customers, but that was good because when I failed I had no one to blame but myself.



It's also a good way to get started, because the decision cycle is very short, and you often agree with yourself.



A few years after I started out (I often alternated between entrepreneurship and salaried employment), I was in charge of an IT department for a pharmaceutical company.



One of my trainees was particularly bright, and I got on well with her at work.



She had launched a project with a friend of hers, but he wasn't doing the work, so she didn't take it very well.



We decided to leave the company and start a new one, together.



A web agency with a difference: whatever the project, it was all the same price (and everything really belonged to the client, unlike many agencies).



Don't laugh: in the 2000s, it was all the rage to launch an agency.

There, the first imbalance: she may have been talented as a tech, but we didn't have the same conception of entrepreneurship.



I might have shared resources with her, invited her to events, but she didn't see entrepreneurship as her job (even though she was a partner in OUR company).



She worked very well as an employee before, but for her it was normal:

- only working from 10-11 a.m.

- never go to events

- not knowing how to pitch our business



I came to think that this was normal and that you couldn't expect others to invest as much as you did, even a partner.

  
After several months in business, we wanted a company with more impact, more ambition.



Not true.



This is what I wanted.



It just went with the flow.



I should have understood by now that we were out of alignment, going bigger was dangerous.

  
We founded a company (Uprigs) in HRTech.



Raised funds (my partner's preparation was hell, it pissed her off and she didn't want to progress on these subjects either).



Appeared on national TV shows at peak viewing times.



More than 130,000 users...



Team recruitment, etc.



Yet it was a failure (but that's another story).



When I came up with a backup plan (taking a stake in one of our customers' companies, thousands of employees, shares offered, etc.), I offered to take it with me.



I ended up with not one partner, but many.



Hell on earth:

- Aberrant decision cycle

- Agility close to zero

- Prefers to party and spend money on travel rather than move forward





It was a rich learning experience...



Joining forces is like being in a couple, without the cuddles under the comforter to make up.



Because yes, just like in a couple, there are arguments.



There are conflicts.



There are disagreements.



15 days before the birth of my daughter, on my way to the office to join our 100 employees, I received a phone call from one of the partners:



“Pascal, I was supposed to call you because I'm the one who met you and offered to join the company. You're going to have to give up your shares and leave. You didn't come to the last party. I know it was on the other side of the country. I know your wife is pregnant. But we were willing to pay anything. You spend all your time trying to move processes forward, but we don't have the same rhythm... We don't operate like that when we're corporate. I'll send you the papers in the evening.”



I had to sell my shares at a low price and start from scratch as I welcomed my youngest child into this life.



This is just one of many anecdotes.



Do any associations go well?



Yes.

  
Is the failure of a partner startup, in 95% of cases, a conflict between partners?



Yes.



So stop looking.



Do not take on a partner due to lack of skills or fear of loneliness, this is a serious mistake that could cost you years of life.



Do you want to start?



Get started.



Trust yourself.

Maybe I'm the problem.



Maybe your partner is magical and I never knew how to choose mine.



However, if I look at the 100 most successful entrepreneurs in my address book, they are solo founders (or they became one by buying out the shares of their original partners).

Entrepreneur,don't know what to do with my life,I think we've hit rock bottom. 300k in debt.,"long read-  Quick back story - Im a serial retailer (i know, awful industry to devote my life to). My weakness is finances. I grew up poor and never learned good habits from my parents.  I am also a high school drop out.  No excuses ofc, just context.

I had a brick and mortar operation for a decade that did well enough. That is until covid came and dessimated us. We reopened after covid shutdowns and closed our doors for good 6 months later.  
About a year prior to covid I was working on building out my clothing line based on the feedback from in store customers about what was missing in the market and what they wanted to buy (i also knew ecommerce had massive potential vs b&m).  We launched it about 4 months before covid, in my store and sold out in days. We restocked once and sold out in a day.

So after I shut the b&m down, I took what little capital I had, about 30k and poured it into the new line and hit ecom hard with ads, influencers and product development. 
Year one we did 220k
Year two we did 800k
Year three 1.2m
Year four 600k
This year we are on track for only 400k.

Here's what happened.

Obviously our growth was substantial. It came fast and hard. We outgrew our warehouse within the first year and moved to a new space.
We we're doing photoshoots and mass content days bi weekly. We were renting studio space at 500 a pop each time.  The unit next door came available.  It was small but had space to grow into and we could dedicate a portion to photo studio. So we snagged it. 

Staff was growing. Costs were growing. We were spending a small fortune on ads but business was growing. I hired a marketing director with quite an impressive background who cost a small fortune. She missed some big issues with adspend and that's where the trouble started. 

We had a freelancer running our ads. At the height he was spending 1500 to 2k daily on fb ads. During all of this I couldn't figure out why we were always short on cashflow. I knew I was spending too much but where. 

FF I came to the realization that he was spending 40% of revenue on ads. He was fired.  The marketing director was let go and ads were taketh in house to be run by me. (Yes I had experience).

At first it went well. I cut spend by about 30%. Sales held steady and only dropped by about 10 to 15% as expected.  So profits were up. 
Then the rest of the issues began.  Site outages, spam attacks etc.  We were plagued with issues all 2023. Sales continued to drop and we couldn't find a footing to scale back up. Obv we had debtload. A mca from shopify and payroll costs and warehouse costs that were sustainable on the previous revenue numbers but not now that we were doing 30% less.

I began reducing debtload like crazy.  I laid off all non essential personnel. I got out of my lease and took a loc to buy a building (50k down) that would save me about 40% in warehousing fees each month. Sales continued to decline as issues persisted on the backend. 

Shopify rolled out opc and we went from 20 to 30 sales per day to 1 to 3. Rode that wave out for 2 months until they fixed whatever they broke and sales stabilized. But we lost our asses during that 2 mos so I took out more of the loc.

Long story shortened...we are 300k in debt. The cost of said debt is killing us every month. 

Sales are still coming in and we have an amazing following. We recently found a viral product but the sales from it haven't yet set us on the positive. 

I don't know where to go from here.... any advice is appreciated.

Do i stop paying debt to save the business?
Do i pack up and file bk?
Do i restructure debt? How?
Do i sell part of the biz and who buys struggling businesses anyway?

The plus is i have 165k in inventory. About 65k equity in the property i bought... but we are cash poor again.....",162,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1fp737q/i_think_weve_hit_rock_bottom_300k_in_debt/,1727277703.0,leggingsaddict84,1fp737q,advice_seeking
Entrepreneur,don't know what to do with my life,What I learned building an app with no technical background,"Over the past two years, my boss (my wife) finally gave me permission to chase my crazy ideas and build a couple apps for business ideas I had. While I’ve played around with WordPress some before, I have no real technical background when it comes to coding, developing, etc.

The harsh reality is this. **I wasted A LOT of time and A LOT of money because of things I had to learn the hard way.** I’m hoping by sharing some of those things here, it can help some of you who have dreams that require dev (that’s what the cool kids call development), but you don’t have the technical background.

Here are nine things I think might be helpful to know/do.

# 1.  Start with one platform (iOS or Android).

It can be tempting to see your dream app launched on every platform out there on day 1, but there are a lot of complications that come with that. With one of our first apps, we tried to build iOS, Android, and web app (desktop) at the same time. Here’s what I didn’t see coming with that:

* **It’s WAY more than just 3x more expensive.** \- Not only do you have to hire an iOS dev, an Android dev, a frontend web dev, and a backend dev, but you are going to have 3x as much testing to do, extra developer accounts to set up and pay for, challenges that arise when certain features don’t act the same on different platforms, additional Slack/email/etc. accounts to set up and pay for, additional design work needed for each platform, and probably a lot more I’m not thinking of right now…It is WAY more expensive than you might think, primarily for the next reason.
* **Different devs work at different speeds, which means risk for wasted time.** \- Ever drive by a construction site and see people just sitting around because they’re waiting on someone else to finish up? The same thing is going to happen if you’re doing multiple platforms. It’s allegedly doable, but you have to sync up making sure the designs and everything are done in time, making sure the backend (which all three environments talk to) knows what’s going on, making sure features are properly discussed with everyone, etc… We tried it, and failed miserably.    

With our most recent app, we just did iOS to start and it was a wildly better experience. We hired a backend developer, an iOS developer, and a QA tester (quality assurance-I’ll cover necessary and wasteful roles in a second). Managing the project was way easier, it was far less expensive, and we got finished way quicker.

And if you’re worried about missing out on customers from the other app store, here’s a suggestion that we did. To ensure we don’t lose too many people who hear about us and have Android, we included an email capture for them to get notified when we release on there. That way, when we launch, we can send them an email and get those sign ups.

*Final thought: There are things like Ionic and NET Maui that allow you to manage multiple platforms at once, but I have no experience with them so I can’t recommend to advise against. Just sharing. If you do choose something like this, I would recommend getting a VERY clear picture of the limitations for current features and future features you want, if any.*

# 2. Hiring is a nightmare.

Full transparency, I won’t have the best solution for you here, but I do have a hefty list of mistakes to avoid that should be helpful.

Finding good devs is a nightmare. When I first started, I had no idea where to look, who was qualified, what I needed, or anything like that. EVERYONE tells you they’re the best in the world, and most of them are full of it.

Here’s a list of mistakes I made and maybe a few glimmers of hope.

**Avoid the big box places where one person does the hiring for you.**

I won’t mention the company but I met with a large talent company who said they had the top something % of devs in the world. They claimed to vet them and test them extensively. I knew they’d be a little more expensive, but the experience was beyond terrible.

First, they jack up the rates of what devs should cost sometimes by 50%+. I knew there would be a markup, but I didn't realize it would be this extreme. I tried to do some research into rates beforehand, but they pulled the wool over my eyes and told me I was getting the best and that these were what rates were, so I figured it would save me in the long run (wrong). I will share some rate guidelines in a few based on my experience to give you a jumping off point.

Second, they bloat the team by a million miles. They had me hire like 9 people, which I was stupid enough to agree to. Scrum masters, designers, devs of all shapes and sizes…they told me I needed every single one of them, and I believed them (wrong).

Third, they had us do a several week “idea exploration” process to fully get the idea specifications broken out. Sounded like a good idea, but in the end, it was nothing more than a bunch of people sitting around talking and pitching ideas. I’ll talk later about how this process is important, but you don’t need 9 people full time for 2-3 weeks to accomplish it.   

Fourth, not all the devs were very good. I literally had a dev taking personal calls during our meetings and who worked maybe a few hours and tried to charge us for a full 40 each week. The company did give us a partial refund on it, but I had to fight for it.

Worst experience of my life.

**You HAVE to find a dev you can trust to help with hiring.**

In the end with the first app, we cut ties with that big company and I had to pay a buyout to get the one dev from the process I trusted. That said, he was integral in helping things move forward. As we started to hire from places like Upwork and similar platforms, he was able to conduct interviews and ask really detailed technical questions to see how applicants thought about problems and if they genuinely had experience.

It still wasn’t full proof, though. For one, he didn’t have experience in every coding language, so he could only look at candidates processes instead of exact technical questions. Also, it’s just hard to get a feel for someone’s skill on an interview for something like this.

# In light of that, here are some tips I would suggest.

* Again, find a dev you can trust. Look for someone from referrals, high ratings, etc. The better you get this, the better the rest will go. I wish I had better suggestions here, but I don’t. (I am willing to make an introduction to a few of the good devs we’ve had along the way, but please don’t waste their time.)
* When your trusted dev interviews candidates, have them ask hard questions. Have them ask for a link to their GitHub. Have them ask for references. Have them ask for prior projects. Have them ask to see code samples. One note here—if/when they give you code samples, see where they're from. If they're from a past project of another client, be on guard. This is a red flag of how they might treat your code in the future because that might not be theirs to share.
* Remember the bill is always paid by you. Be part of these interviews. If something feels wrong, don’t overlook it just because you’re excited (I did this and paid for it).
* The second you realize someone is dead weight, cut them lose. We held on to people far too long that needed to go way sooner, and that cost us a lot of wasted cash.
* Make sure the person you are interviewing is the one working on the project. We’ve seen people try and pull the switcheroo to include someone passing answers to someone during an interview lol. Also, make sure you’re not talking to a project lead who is just going to outsource the work to junior developers. Ask them point blank if they are doing 100% of the work.
* Don’t forget to factor in working hours and time zones when hiring. If you have people all over the world in different time zones, it does slow things down. The more overlap you can have, the better.
* We had disproportionately bad success with people named Connor, so maybe avoid hiring anyone named Connor. I’m kidding, but I’m also not.

# Here are the roles that I think are critical, might be needed (based on your skills), and the ones that are worthless.

These are just my opinions and projects come in all shapes and sizes, so take what you want and leave the rest here.

* **Backend Dev** \- definitely necessary. Most apps (from my understanding) have all the “logic” and thinking parts on a server and the apps just call from that server and show it on the phone.
* **iOS/Android Dev** \- definitely necessary. You need someone who knows the platform you are building on.
* **Designer** \- maybe necessary. This was maybe our biggest waste of money, though. I am embarrassed to say how much we paid for a designer who in the end just gave us a “style sheet” I probably could have come up with in a few hours myself. Yes, there is value in hiring a professional here, but make sure you know EXACTLY what the deliverables will be and do payment on a per project basis, not hourly.
* **QA Tester** \- most likely needed. This is a person who tests the app for bugs and mistakes. I thought I could do this myself and realized that even though I am extremely detail oriented, I still was not the best at it. Having a good tester really did a lot for the value of our project. (I do have a good tester who is only part time for us right now, so reach out if you’re looking for someone but again, please don’t waste his time.) Also, be aware there are two types of testers. One who is a skilled dev and uses scripts to test the limits of things. The other is someone who is less expensive, but is just super detail oriented to clicking through and finding ways to break what was built. We saved by hiring the latter and letting our devs handle the first as they had some experience in it.
* **Scrum Master** \- waste of time unless you’re not involved in the project. This is like a project manager who uses a system called Scrum to manage the team. Honestly, I found Scrum to be a waste of time with way too many meetings and it had a weird hatred for deadlines, which I wasn’t a fan of at all. I actually went and took the scrum master class and test during out project to take on the role myself (and prove a point, but that's another story for another day). In reality, I even further found scrum to be a waste of time, but I know a lot of people will disagree with me. THAT SAID, if you do not have project management experience of some type (I have a lot from past businesses and being a military officer), you should hire someone to manage the project. Additionally, I was available 24/7 due to my work at the time, so that helped a lot.
* **DevOps** \- So, DevOps is the process that big companies use to push new “builds” (think versions) through “pipelines” to the testing team and then to “production” (what the real user sees). Think of this like moving a dish from your oven (development environment), to the kitchen counter (test environment), to the dining table for your guests (production environment). I have mixed feelings on this one. It 100% makes sense to protect against problems when you’re pushing updates when you have real users, but it’s also kind of a luxury in my mind. It’s super expensive to find someone good, and while I think it has helped us a lot—I still think I’d avoid it in the future until we got bigger. When you’re just doing an app, you can use things like TestFlight as your test environment (provided by Apple). Also, if you’re just having your app built and trying to save, I might look to skip DevOps and build it out later once you’ve seen some success.

# To give you a starting point on what these people may cost, here are the rough rate ideas I’ve seen from our experience.

These are really rough and just ranges based on what I saw with people we hired and didn’t hire.

**Developers (all types)**

* India/Middle East - $10 - $40 an hour
* Eastern Europe - $25 - $70 an hour
* Europe - $40 - $150 an hour
* U.S. - $50 - $150 an hour

A few additional notes here:

* Higher rate does NOT always mean more skilled.
* Lower rates DO generally mean less skilled, minus a really random outlier here and there.
* You can find hidden gems overseas, especially in some areas of Eastern Europe. I did find that area to be the best mix of skill and value.
* I found that everyone in the U.S. charges U.S. prices, regardless of their actual skill. In other words, the biggest discrepancies between skill and rate were in the U.S. (this doesn't mean there weren't devs in the U.S. that deserved these rates)

**DevOps**

* $100 - $300 an hour (could only find in the U.S. and Europe)

**Scrum Masters and QA Testers**

These were ALL over the place but were generally less expensive than the devs.

# 3. Turnover is expensive.

When you find great devs, treat them like kings and queens. When you have to bring someone new on, expect that process to take about a week, sometimes a little longer to really ramp up to speed. During this week, your lead dev (usually your most expensive) has to take their time to train up the new dev on the project. So, you’re paying for both of their time, while nothing new is being developed. Also, if you're doing multiple platforms (and sometimes even with one), this can mess up your synchronization and you end up with that construction site problem of people sitting around.

That said, don’t let this be a reason to hang on to someone who is deadweight, because that is WAY more expensive.

# 4. Get contracts in place for EVERYTHING.

This is a basic business rule, but a must with development. Make sure you have NDAs, non-competes for your industry, and proper contractor agreements that cover things like (this is not an exhaustive list):

* Rate of pay
* Services to be performed
* Ownership of materials
* Proprietary information
* Independent contractor status (not a partner, no taxes withheld, no insurance, etc.)
* Termination of the agreement
* Confidentiality
* Revolving disputes
* Applicable law

Again, I am not a lawyer, so these are just suggestions. Do not take any of this as legal advice. Get a real lawyer and not just the Offices of Chat GPT, Attorney at Law.

# 4. Research the technologies you might use first.

Just because you don’t have a technical background does not mean you shouldn’t try your best to know as much as possible. Here are a few realities:

**Devs tend to pick what they like**. This can be a good thing, but they might like something because it’s rare or complex. Or, it might be something new that they are learning and are excited about.

The reality is that you are not their playground. Additionally, finding replacement devs for a complex or weird coding language can be hard.

**You are generally stuck with what the first dev picks.** If your first dev proves to be a dud and they picked an awful language/framework, you are left with the hard choice of deleting everything or a tough hiring process.

Now, all of this is tough when you have no technical background, but here are a few tips.

* When they suggest a language/framework, look around at places like Upwork to see how many people there are saying that is their specialty. If you find none or very few (or it’s always an afterthought in their profiles), that’s probably an issue.
* Ask them to tell you WHY they chose that framework.
* Ask them to give you time to do some research on your own.
* Pay for an hour or two of another developer’s time for a consultation to get their opinion on the framework set up. Devs love to crap on other devs for some reason, so use this to really battle-test the set up.

One real world example of this is that we chose to use Microsoft Azure over AWS for our servers. In the end, I think this ended up being the right choice for us, but finding AWS devs is WAY easier than finding Azure devs, especially with the DevOps stuff. I do think more devs are trained in Azure now so it’s not as big of a deal, but just an example from when we started to give you an idea of what I mean.

# 5. Control the log ins.

I’m going to put this in all caps because it’s that important. MAKE SURE YOU CAN ACCESS EVERYTHING AND THAT YOU CONTROL THE LOG INS TO EVERYTHING. Your devs should never have access to something that you can’t shut them out of in an instant.

Thankfully, our first dev was super smart on this and had every person we hired get a lovetrackapp email and use that for anything and everything. That way, if you ever have to let someone go, you don’t have to worry about them having access to things that you don’t.

In practice this means, you set up the Gmail admin account, you control the domain name, you control the main access to the servers, you control the Apple Dev account, etc. You can ALWAYS add people as devs with proper permissions, but you need to be the super admin across the board. This may take a little learning on your part, but it’s doable. For clarity, this doesn’t mean you just have a log in, but it means you are the super admin who literally clicked the “sign up” or “create account” button.

Ideally, this is never important to you, but if it ever is, you’ll be happy you did it.

# 6. Understand what an MVP is and be okay with it.

MVP stands for Minimum Viable Product. In other words, it’s the smallest/lightest version of your app that you can build that is good enough to at least test and see if the idea is good or not.

As someone without a tech background and a lot of passion for our project, my idea of an MVP was WILDLY different from what a real MVP was—and that cost us money. The idea of an MVP is to get to market and be able to start getting users and seeing if you have a winner without breaking the bank. The problem, though, is I struggled to separate what would be a super helpful feature and what was essential.

With our first app, I blew this…hard. I thought everything was a must have when it really was not. With out most recent app (LoveTrack, a date night planner), I finally got this right. To frame the example, here’s a quick description of what the app does. The app helps you plan better date nights by showing real events in your area on the day you want to have a date night, by showing you custom/unique dates, and by walking you through how to plan these dates/what you need/etc.

The only things that are essential are getting people’s basic information about what they want, showing them date ideas, and allowing them to walk through the process to plan the date. Everything else is nice and will be added later, but is not part of the MVP.

**The more cutthroat you can be with what you exclude from your MVP, the more you’ll save.** Once you know you have a winner, go wild with the features.

There’s a small caveat to this that I’ll cover in the next section.

# 7. Save money by having the most obnoxiously detailed specs ever BEFORE you talk to anyone.

The single best way to save time and money with your app build is to have obnoxiously detailed specs about every feature, every screen, every functionality—everything. A LOT of the time spent with our projects that could have been saved was fleshing out functions and thinking through all different scenarios.

What I’ve learned is that with the right mindset, you can do this yourself. Doing it with the whole team is fine, but you are paying for everyone’s time in that meeting. For example, if you have 5 devs and they call cost $50 an hour (oversimplifying as a hypothetical example here), that's $250 an hour for planning. If you only have things fleshed out to 50%, that’s a lot of overhead to get to 100%. But if you come in at 95%, it won’t take long to get the team moving on actual development.

Here’s an example of the mindset. With LoveTrack, I wanted the live events happening on the day of your date (things like concerts, plays, festivals, etc.) to show at the top of the screen after you answered some questions about your date.

When I first started (with our other apps), that’s the extent of how I would have described the feature. However, here’s what I would include with it now:

*Feature: Show live events from Ticketmaster partnership at the top of main dashboard page*

* Show up to X number of events.
* If fewer than X number of events exist, show Y.
* If no events exist, show Z.
* If fetching of events fails, show XY.
* If app goes offline, show XY.
* Show events in a carousel. Here are a few links to samples and screenshots that look like what I want.
* Carousel should take up roughly 1/3 of screen on most devices.
* Sort events this way.
* Here’s a sketch of the information I’d like shown for each event and how I’d like it laid out.
* If event name is too long to fit, do this.
* Navigate here if link is clicked.
* Button text should be X.
* Here’s a link to the Ticketmaster API information.

Just an example and not with the exact details, but the idea is to show you how to think of EVERYTHING. Even the simplest of buttons should be broken down this way.

If you have different membership levels, have a levels matrix where you clearly show what permissions each level of member has. The more obnoxiously detailed you can be, the better.

**Marking MVP vs Future Feature**

One thing that’s super important is marking which features are for MVP and which are future features. You might be asking, “Wouldn’t it confuse them to put all of this into the same document? Shouldn’t I just show them the MVP features only?”

While I get the logic here, the reality is there are ways they can build things that make way for future features down the line. So, having your devs aware of your definite future features and your “hopes and dreams” features, can really be helpful in how they build things to save you time and money down the line. A good dev will be able to give you options along the way like “we could do it this way that would work now but will make this harder later or we could do it this way now which would take X number of additional days/hours, but will make that way easier later”, and then you get to decide.

**What You Think is Hard Might Not Be. Vice Versa**

Something I tried to do was manage the features the devs worked on based on how long I thought it would take. I would neglect telling them about certain features because I figured it would take too long and I wanted to keep them focused to manage the budget. The problem with this is that some features I thought would take days literally took like an hour and were HUGE improvements. This was also true the other way around.

The takeaway here is to get time estimations on all the ideas you have (one thing I did like from the scrum process). I thought I knew what was easy and what was hard, and I was wrong…a lot.

# 8. Have a technical plan for scaling.

Quick story time—I have a friend who built an app that started off pretty successfully. They got up to 100k users, and everything was going great—until the app crashed because it wasn’t built to handle that level of volume.

If you’re expecting a ton of users, make sure you hire devs that understand scaling. The term I heard tossed around by people who seemed to know what they were talking about was “enterprise level”. Basically, these skilled devs could easily articulate to me how things would work and what would change (automatically and manually) as we got to certain user levels, with specifics.

Now, is all of this necessary from day one? Probably not. I’d say that we overspent on doing these things when we were just trying to validate an idea, but it’s not like they’re wasted costs down the line if you succeed.

And remember, every dev will tell you that they know how to scale. Find someone who has experience with it or can talk you through it without just hitting you with tech jargon. Again, I don't have a great answer for sifting through the mud here, but do your best.

# 9. Stay on your people. Daily.

Lastly, and this is an important one—trust but verify. Stay on your people daily. Get daily status reports from people. Don’t let things go for a few days or even a week. If you are not 100% transparently clear on what is going on, you’re doing it wrong. If you are ever surprised by a delay, you’re doing it wrong.

I trusted that everything was going great far too often. This cost us time, money, and quite a bit of sanity. Even a few days gets expensive with dev and can get everyone off track. There were always ripple effects that seemed to last for a while when one person was off track.

And there is a nuance here that is important. With the first apps, I did this, but I didn’t press when I didn’t understand something. I didn’t pry when I thought I was being fed a line. If they told me “worked on X feature today”, I took that as sufficient (it’s not). If you are not 100% confident in things, keep asking until you are. Be okay feeling embarrassed. I learned that the phrase “pardon my ignorance” would go a long way (but don’t use that if you think your devs will use it as a way out).

Remember, they work for you. You are paying the bill, so you deserve to understand where things are. This also makes it WAY easier to drill down on what went wrong when a deadline is missed.

***Edit****: Just wanted to clarify something here based on a few comments. I am NOT advocating for micromanagement at all. All I'm saying is make sure you're aware of what is going on, what's being worked on, and what the status of things are.*

Entrepreneur,career change at 30/40,"Changing Careers, changing products? Age 38, Direction needed, investment advice too.","Hello,  
At one point in my life I had a set plan that I had been following in which to design a life that fit my values, but during 2020 the viability was called into question and I have been on bad footing, unable to find stability, since. Though I currently have stable housing without roommate, and enough in savings for a year without any income and three more years in a mutual fund. The question I need help with is about utilizing approximately $40,000 that I would like to invest into a new or existing business venture, or possibly start investing my own hand in selecting stocks.

To give context about the parameters of concepts that pertain to me, back in 2005 I graduated highschool and immediately was an entrepreneur, started a sports clothing company, was selling WoW bot accounts, ghillie suits on ebay, and graphic design commissions, and I was proficient in MX Flash. Although the first part of my life plan to start farming three years before 2012 for what I thought would be a peak oil economic collapse, and while watching 2008 unfold, along with my career in MX Flash falling flat, I started farming 2009.

From that point I spent a total of 15 years farming, the majority of that was for my own LLC, where I was situated with leases on million dollar properties as Ag tax write off, on an elite island outside a major city, serving local high price wholesale, mainly salad mix and mushrooms, because they are fast turn around.

That was truly the best 20s I could have asked for, working mainly for myself, very healthy and was putting away $10-20k in savings/investments per year, plus was earning about $3-5k more per year, while living in a cargo trailer on dirt cheap leases. But it all came to a slow end starting in 2020 when I lost all of my wholesale overnight, and my retail exploded, which burnt me out to the point I couldnt walk, as the sole worker in my LLC. So I do not fully trust the volatility of the wholesale food industry, from a small grower’s perspective, since i don't own land.

SO now I am trying to figure out a way forward, because I can always farm in the future, and have taught myself hydroponics, and flat packed farm equipment, so my business is very agile and now I can grow in parking lots closer to the city for more sales opportunities, but I am not sure that is what I want to do in this current moment, because tech is exploding, and we have never had so much information available to us, it's a shame not to spend a moment in life to discover what new opportunities might be out there.

I was laid off twice last year, so I've been out of work the past four months, doing thriftstore routes twice a week while making about $500+/wk, really just trying to understand what people still buy and break even, while I continue to study 3d design blender, as well as 2d digital art in the hopes that I can reconnect with my tech art past, because that is what I told myself when I was 18, that I would put off art and computers until I was past 30 and needed to do less with my body. But over the past three years, the better I get at digital art, the better Ai has been getting too. I have some mentors who might give me work and a foot in the door, but most of them are laid off, and scrounging for work if they are not on their own funded indie project.

I've thought about continuing to learn 3d modeling despite Ai, and despite seeing Flash, computer program I was proficient in get removed from existence before I could really earn my money back. I assume there will always be a need for Ai models to get cleaned up, mapped and rigged, especially with AR technology coming to consumers soon, but more over it would help if I decided to go to a community college to do CNC certificates, so I can have that as a backup job on CAD at a machining warehouse and do my farm and digital art on the side, but CNC mechanics don't make a crazy amount of money and have a boss. BUT I am an inventor, and have two inventions so far, plus my ultimate goal is to one day have automated hydroponic greenhouses, using all CNC+3d printed parts to create a low time investment agriculture income, with Ai monitored greenhouse, seed to salad product that i can sell to other people, which would tie into my desire to teach people about farming too, as well as do something I enjoy, but it is not a proven concept yet.

  
  


Anyways if you've read this far I appreciate it, I ultimately would like 3rd party feedback about how I should spend my $40k surplus cash. I originally had it saved and accessible in case I was going to lease land and start my full farm business again from scratch, but I think using the equipment and space I have, and exploring non-perishable products is a smart move for me right now. Should I invest in inventory of products to arbitrage online? Should I invest in the top index funds? Should I buy Silver? Should I invest in inventory of a new product line? Should I spend some money insuring and equipment for a landscaping company?  
  
I want to future proof myself the best I can as Ai unfolds, I am pretty set with an income for the rest of my life as long as I can grow food and sell it, but there are currently so many changing opportunities, I want to cast out my net and see what works with my temperment. I’ve thought about getting into cyber security, or maybe be an electrician, or less staple jobs like Landscape Architech (can use art/modeling) and CNC engineer/modeler, but honestly I prefer to make a product and sell it without client service related interaction, and particularly no boss. Thank you for reading

Entrepreneur,go back to school,"Graduated a top law school, got laid off, built a 7 figure consumable brand - but now I want to go back into law. Am I insane?","I graduated law school when I was 24 a couple of years ago, worked at a firm for a year, and got laid off due to lack of work. The job market was terrible so I pivoted and went all-in on my consumable brand that I was playing around with on the side.

Fast forward to now the brand is doing around 7 figures in revenue with decent margins and is scaling profitably. I run the PPC, the strategy, and everything. I didn't know if it would be possible to scale profitably since i'm in an oversaturated niche but after countless hours, I figured it out and so far the trend has been good and i'm happy with what i'm doing. 

It sounds insane for me to give this all up and step away but on the other hand I feel disturbed that my law career crashed before it even took off. I ask this question because I have an opportunity to go back to law school to do a 1yr masters in tax which could potentially open up biglaw for me again and I have been struggling hard with this decision. I don't know if i'm over-glamorizing it because I never really had a chance to practice or if i'm wired to chase prestige, but I just feel off. I would have felt much better had I practiced law for a couple of years and then getting to this point because I would have at least had a chance to experience it and decide on my own terms if I wanted to leave. 

Law is not like many other careers where you can step in and out especially if you have very little experience. So if I don't go back to school and grab a job i'm closing the door on my legal career forever. 

It's too hard to give up the freedom I have and the chance to scale higher than I could at any law firm, but I also idealize working on big complex deals at a firm because I found tax law to be very intellectually stimulating. Of course i'm not going to like the corporate politics, high billing requirements, and being on call all the time. But I am also worried that I could miss my last chance to save my law career and also fail on this business since all it takes is Amazon finding a bs reason to ban you and its basically over.

Entrepreneur,go back to school,Should I go back to school after starting a successful business?,"I spent my 20's pursuing a ""career"" in art and was a ""starving"" artist until I started my business at 31. Before starting my business I was so broke and in debt from just trying to survive that I filed bankruptcy Jan 2023 and 3 months later I started my first successful business which now makes 90-100k per year (80% passively as I sell products). I have a college degree but no solid corporate experience and would not be able to get a job that pays me as well as my business does. 

I have plans to expand my business and income streams in 2025 as having my shop as my only stream of income stresses me out. Knowing it won't last forever and unsure how long it will last, I've contemplate going to nursing school. I love what I do in my business but the anxiety of losing it keeps me up at night. 

My thinking is, (1) if i didn't have my business I would 100% go to nursing school (2) The nursing field has a large opportunity for part time per diem work that would allow me to work on my business (and other entrepreneurial endeavors) while maintain a good paying w2 job for security & health insurance.

But again, I love what I do in my business and my business is very unique and I know is not something that just happens to anyone. If I could do this forever I would but the shop life of my business seems to be 2-5 years based on my research. I like to think I'll make it to 5 years since im still seeing growth in my numbers.

So I've gone back and forth between do I go to nursing school now or do I just keep it as my back up. I fear going now would hinder my business growth potential because it will take up a lot of my time. But waiting to go means my anxiety of my business failing doesn't go away. It also means I would still have 2.5yrs of schooling to do before being able to work as a nurse if I wait.

I never had a back up in my 20's and I wish i had made smarter choices but I was a dreamer, still am, but now I want to make sure I make smarter choices. I equate my business to winning a small lottery, like I have some money now, but once its gone (or held up in investments) I'm back to wear I started essentially (minus having the knowledge I've gathered from building and running my biz). 

I'm hoping someone on here has faced this same feeling/dilemma and can tell me what they decided and how it went. And also hoping any other entrepreneurs who relate or have advice could share an advice they have as well.

Do i sacrifice a little bit of my time for these 2.5 yrs of schooling now while I maintain and hopefully grow my business for the chance to feel secure or do I stay all in on entrepreneurship?",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1go6jgl/should_i_go_back_to_school_after_starting_a/,1731261508.0,justdoingmathing,1go6jgl,advice_seeking
Entrepreneur,go back to school,"Do any of you have side or ""fall back"" gigs you go to during slow times? ","I've had a couple slow months in a row and my pipeline is looking dryer than I'd like too. 

Every time this happens I start to think that maybe I should line up some sort of side gig I can jump into relatively easily for fast cash. 

Things have generally picked back up again before I got desperate enough to really put some work into the side gig, but I'm a little more concerned than usual this time. 

Does anyone else have something like this? 

A couple years ago I did doordash. At the time it was great because I could go out and make $100 relatively easily with no commitment beyond delivering whatever order I just picked up. But apparently things have slowed down and gotten oversaturated there. 

I have some marketable freelance skills but to cash in on them I'd have to put more focus into building relationships and taking on commitments that would distract me from the bigger goal I'm working towards. It'd pretty much take over and it's not really what I want to do. 

I'm also considering dog walking or Uber driving but I don't know how quickly I could jump into either or how consistent the work would be. 

I was also a teacher in a past life and could probably get on the substitute teacher roll relatively easily at the local school district. 

But the main thing is I want to stay focused on my bigger goal and primary business. So easy, flexible, and low commitment are the name of the game. 

I'm mostly curious to know if any other entreprenuers are in a similar boat and how you go about thinking these things through. How much commitment are you willing to take on? 

I'll gladly listen to thoughts or suggestions on good side gigs too. ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1etrvwc/do_any_of_you_have_side_or_fall_back_gigs_you_go/,1723822397.0,rococo78,1etrvwc,advice_seeking
Entrepreneur,is a master's degree worth it,Wife wanting to buy into a franchise/current business,"Hi everybody. I'm posting on behalf of my wife. To put it simply, she wants to buy into a franchise or an existing business. She's currently a marriage and family therapist but she's always talked about wanting to own her own business. She's been leaning more into buying into a franchise because she doesn't have a lot of experience in business directly so she feels like she would get a little more structure and support (she has 2 Master's degrees - one in Healthcare Administration and another for her therapy, not sure what the degree is specifically). I have a little experience in business but my primary skillset is in tech, so I'll help where I can but I'm just not educated enough on the topic at hand.

So, essentially she's just starting to get discouraged because she doesn't know exactly where to start. She's looked into some medical offices and the like where her HA education could help and such. She's looked into SBA loans, etc. but she's noticed that there's typically some type of down payment required (I've seen 10% or 20% I believe) and we just don't have that liquid cash right now.

She's also looked into just buying an existing, privately owned business but personally I think those can exude a bit more risk unless you're an expert in that field because there is no support, so you're responsible for literally everything. 

We don't have a high net worth. We're just an average American family, but I want to support her as much as I can, hence the reason for my post here. So, I guess ultimately I'm asking for advice or notable resources where she can grow her business education, if there are any possible ways to get around down payments, would an SBA be the best loan to look into?

Appreciate any insight the community here can provide and apologies if this isn't detailed enough. I guess if any questions arise I'll answer them as they come.

Entrepreneur,is a master's degree worth it,"Need advice from experienced people: feeling stuck at a crossroads | Please, I'm really desperate","Perhaps it's worth starting with what stage I'm at and what kind of background I have. I graduated from urban planning (focused on the design of buildings and structures), I worked as a design engineer, a foreman on the site, and now I work as a project manager (although only the name comes from him, rather some kind of secretary), and I am also studying for a master's degree in the same specialty.

My overall work experience is around 2 years, this summer I opened a YouTube channel, I used to love editing, and it turned out to be interesting to shoot videos (besides that, I like to draw).

About 2 years ago, my partner and I, who is much more experienced than me, started developing a startup, but the project is going slowly because it is quite large, and perhaps this is also one of the reasons for my doubts. I have an analytical mindset, I have basic design knowledge (well, almost not enough to make money), I know how to structure information, I love inventing, but it's difficult for me to complete a routine or finish it alone. I do not know what is happening, there are many opportunities, even in the job where I am currently working, it would seem that you can come up with something (but the management is terrible, and it is difficult for me to communicate with them, but the potential of the idea they are doing is really high).

On the other hand, I'm not learning anything (I'm just doing my own education, I'm learning management, psychology, and I'm trying to break down in myself, I'm learning how to make high-quality videos).

There are so many things that I do not know what to do. I want to go to a larger company and also work as a manager, but I feel like I'm going to die out (although I haven't died out where I've been working for a year now, on the other hand, I have to admit that my self-esteem has dropped a little and the fervor that I had before too).

Either stay and use a more or less free schedule and do something of your own, take a startup (separate the piece that we are doing with a partner and try to develop it and sell it, instead of eating the whole elephant).

Or go back to your specialty (it's kind of interesting) and try yourself in a technical survey of buildings, an architect, and so on. I'm 23.

Entrepreneur,is a master's degree worth it,Business vs Data Science Degree,"Hello everyone,

I’m a Brazilian student currently studying in Portugal, and I could really use some advice. I’m passionate about entrepreneurship, data, and economics, but right now, I’m pursuing a Data Science degree, and to be honest, I feel completely drained and unmotivated.

I chose Data Science because I know how valuable it can be for building SaaS products, analyzing markets, and even automating business processes. In theory, it’s the perfect skill set for an aspiring entrepreneur. But in practice, I feel like I’m losing myself. The technical focus of the degree—programming, stats, and endless theory—makes me feel disconnected from what I actually want: building something meaningful and impactful.

Recently, I’ve been seriously considering switching to a Business/Administration degree instead. My thought process is that it might align more with my entrepreneurial goals—helping me develop leadership, strategy, and broader business knowledge.

Here are my main dilemmas:
	1.	Is Data Science still worth pursuing for entrepreneurship? It feels like a long road, but I know the world is becoming increasingly data-driven.
	2.	Would switching to a Business degree give me better tools for starting my own company? Or would I miss out on the technical skills I might need later?
	3.	Has anyone been in a similar situation? Did you follow through with a business-focused degree, or stick with a technical one, and how did that work out for you?

I don’t want to feel like I’m just “doing a degree” for the sake of it. I want to spend my time building skills that will actually help me achieve freedom and independence through entrepreneurship. But right now, I feel stuck and unsure of which path will serve me best.

If you have any advice, experiences, or even questions I should be asking myself, I’d love to hear them.

Entrepreneur,quit job to start business,Quitting my 450K tech job to start my own business ,"Hey Reddit,

I’m 36, originally from India and have been in the US since 2013 on an H1B visa. After a decade of dealing with corporate bureaucracy and soul-crushing tech sales (managing upwards and all that bootlicking—ugh), I finally got my green card in the summer of 2023.

I’ve always hated trading time for money doing work I don’t care about. So, I’ve decided to take a leap. My wife and I are heading to India soon for six weeks with our 3-month-old baby. She quit her job in July, and we’ve been gearing up for a big shift in our lives.

Financially, we’re in a decent spot—we can cover our expenses for two years without dipping into retirement savings. With that safety net, I’m planning to leverage my knowledge of the US market, my network in India, and my background in tech and business to explore these three industries:

1.	Lab-Grown Diamond Imports – Leveraging India’s expertise in diamond manufacturing and finding markets in the US.

2.	Textile Imports & B2B Wholesale – Starting with Amazon FBA and eventually building a brand (long-term vision here).

3.	Countertop & Tile Imports – Focused on B2B sales to US customers.

I know these are all pretty different, but I’m hoping one of them clicks. I’m excited (and honestly, a little terrified) about taking the plunge into entrepreneurship after being in Corporate America my entire career.

Wish me luck! Am I crazy for leaving the relative “safety” of corporate America, or is this the leap I’ve always needed to take? Would love to hear your thoughts, advice, or success stories from anyone who’s done something similar!

I started a golf apparel brand as a side hustle in December 2022, and it has grown to the point where I’m comfortably able to leave my job and put 100% effort into growing that business, and also start other businesses/revenue streams. 

For anyone else out there with experience - what steps would you take to leverage the success of one business, and diversify/expand your business/investment portfolio? 

I’m also going to document everything on my instragram and TikTok, in hopes that I can inspire others with similar dreams. ",122,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1ku2ari/28_years_old_quitting_my_job_to_pursue_my_dream/,1748057713.0,Gageb34,1ku2ari,advice_seeking
Entrepreneur,quit job to start business,I have 200k and I want to quit my day job. ,"I have been very successful in working in the legal field but the firm I worked for, and was doing well in, closed. Had to start all over with a new company that doesn’t pay me near as much and takes up all my time. I have 200k that I made off a real estate investment. I’ve looked into franchises, creating my own brand of something. I don’t know how to use this money to really scale and turn it into way more long term but also so that I can quit my day job within a year or two. I have always had the determination, the discipline and the responsibility to succeed and have reached a lot of my goals but i’m missing mentors in my life and I really don’t have anyone with a business/growth mindset I can talk to.
Seems like I have helped make others a shit ton of money and I want to do that for myself now.",190,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1grz26y/i_have_200k_and_i_want_to_quit_my_day_job/,1731685032.0,Upset_Philosophy7391,1grz26y,advice_seeking
Entrepreneur,quit job to start business,Left a well-paid consulting job to start my own business and feeling unmotivated and stuck. Lost in own dreams. ,"Maybe this post will be helpful for someone; perhaps someone will see themselves in my story, and the comments from other users will assist them, just as they can help me.

I'll start by saying that I worked in consulting for about 6 years. In my country, I earned a very decent salary and held the position of project manager. However, since high school, I’ve tried my hand at small business projects and always dreamed of eventually transitioning from employment to entrepreneurship. I didn’t make serious money in business; they were more like attempts, but I was always interested—like an online store for Chinese clothing and accessories, and custom-designed notebooks.

I come from a well-off middle-class family, so I never had a significant need for money; my father has a good business. At work, I always fantasized about starting my own business as if it were an obsession, even though I had decent results at my job. I didn’t fully unlock my potential.

In the office, I often thought that I had dozens of great startup ideas and that I would earn big money doing what I love if I left my job. After saving up enough to support myself for a year, I quit because I didn’t plan to juggle both.

After quitting, I wanted to take a 3-week vacation to recharge before starting on my projects. But now, two months later, I can’t find the motivation to begin—some ideas no longer seem promising, others seem difficult to implement, and new ideas aren’t coming. I feel a sort of crisis, but it’s not depression or burnout; rather, I’m in a comfort zone, plus I have passive income from the family business where I invested a significant sum two years ago to help my father, receiving dividends equivalent to half of my previous salary.

To be completely honest, I want to admit that I smoke marijuana—not every day, but definitely several times a week. I didn’t do this at work; I maintained a diet to keep my motivation up because otherwise, I felt like I wouldn’t be able to keep up the pace.

I also live with my sister in a three-room apartment; I'm 31 years old, and she’s 34. We live comfortably without conflicts, which might also affect me somehow.

I don’t want to come off as whiny or weak, but I really feel stuck in a light rut. I would love to hear your opinions on what steps to take, where to start, and how to get back into a productive state. How can I overcome this situation? What am I doing wrong?

I’m ready to answer all questions as honestly as possible. Thank you all for your responses!

UPDATE | UPDATE | UPDATE

I’d like to say that I didn’t expect such amount of good advice, support and interest to my post. Thank you everyone for sharing your experience and providing your perspective on my question. 
I hope these will help not only me but others in the same situation. Reddit people you are the best 🙏🏻",87,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1f384kj/left_a_wellpaid_consulting_job_to_start_my_own/,1724845700.0,Randomyouser322,1f384kj,advice_seeking
Entrepreneur,quit job to start business,"I lost $8,000 on dropshipping so you don't have to","Dropshipping Reality Check

Got tired of seeing the same bullshit dropshipping success stories everywhere.

I spent 18 months and $8,000 of my own money testing what these gurus actually teach. Tried 47 different products, 12 different suppliers, ran ads on Facebook, Google, TikTok. Here's what actually happened.

**The Numbers Don't Lie:**

* Total revenue: $14,300
* Total ad spend: $11,200
* Product costs: $3,800
* Chargebacks/returns: $1,900
* Net loss: $8,000 (including my time)

**What Nobody Tells You:**

**Facebook Ads Are Brutal Now** iOS 14.5 killed tracking. My winning ad campaigns from 2021 don't work anymore. CPM went from $8 to $25+ in my niche. You need 3x the budget just to test products now.

**Supplier Issues Are Real** AliExpress shipping times killed my conversion rates. Customers expect Amazon-speed delivery. Tried 3 different ""US warehouses"" - all dropshipped from China anyway. One supplier disappeared with $1,200 of my money.

**Customer Service Nightmare** Spent 2-3 hours daily answering angry emails about delayed orders. Had to issue refunds constantly. My Shopify store got flagged for too many chargebacks. PayPal held my funds for 6 months.

**The Real Competition** Amazon has the same products for cheaper with 2-day shipping. Why would anyone buy from my sketchy website? I was competing against billion-dollar companies with my $500 budget.

**What Actually Works Instead:**

Found 3 business models that beat dropshipping:

**Local Service Flipping** Buy services on Fiverr for $20, sell to local businesses for $200. Did this with Google My Business optimization. Made $3,200 in 2 months with zero inventory.

**Digital Product Creation** Turned my dropshipping failure into a $39 ""What Not to Do"" guide. Sold 180 copies. Made more in 3 weeks than 6 months of dropshipping.

**Retail Arbitrage** Buy clearance items at Target/Walmart, sell on eBay/Amazon. Boring but profitable. Made $1,800 last month spending weekends at stores.

**The Truth About Dropshipping:**

* 95% of stores fail within 6 months
* You need $10K+ to test properly now
* Customer acquisition costs are insane
* You're competing with Amazon
* It's not passive income at all

**If You're Still Gonna Try It:**

* Start with $5K minimum budget
* Pick ONE platform for ads
* Test 10 products max
* Have a backup plan
* Don't quit your day job

Save yourself the headache and pick something else. There's a reason these gurus sell courses instead of actually dropshipping.

Anyone else been through this nightmare? What worked for you after dropshipping failed?",1647,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1lxwzev/i_lost_8000_on_dropshipping_so_you_dont_have_to/,1752315139.0,TechnologyCrafty3546,1lxwzev,advice_seeking
Entrepreneur,quit job to start business,Should I quit my sales job to go all-in on my startup?,"I’m 20 (21 soon) and have been building a website that creates ready-to-post ads for small pet supply businesses. I started with zero experience and have made insane progress in just a month. I’m obsessed. I work on it before, during, and after my job. Work on it from the time I wake up, to the time I go to sleep on the days I don’t have work. It’s all I think about. It’s an unhealthy obsession. Every ounce of time I have is devoted to this project.

I’m a car salesman and have been one of the top performers at my dealership since I started a year and a half ago. It’s the best job I’ve had, but lately I’ve lost interest. It’s time consuming (50-70 hours a week) My performance is slipping because all I want to do is build my startup. I’ve grown to dislike my job and have a bad mentality. I want out. I want freedom. I want to build wealth on my terms.

My MVP is nearly finished. No beta users or revenue yet, but I have some savings, low expenses, and could sell my 2025 ZX6R if needed.

I know this can work. I’m all in mentally. I just haven’t taken the full leap yet. With how much I’ve gotten done with the limited free time I have, it makes me question how far I could be if I had more time to spend on it. It feels like every second spent away from it, is a second away from being where I want to be in life.

Should I quit my job and go balls-deep into this? Am I being unreasonable?

Looking for advice from people who’ve been here. I’m hungry, disciplined, and serious getting where I want to go by any means necessary. I feel caged and want to escape. It builds every day.

Entrepreneur,quit job to start business,Should i quit my job and have a go at a online business??,"Should i quit my jobs and just go all out, have a go at a online business? 

Im in a good financial position where i get 1k a week passive income from my investments, so basically if i quit this is what i would be living off to have a go at the online business? Since this is the situation i am in, should i just do it ? 

I know some people will say you can do both, keep the job and start a online business, thats true expect ive been wanting to do this for YEARSSS now and never done anything and my hypothesis is because i have a job, thats why i believe a job is some what of a trap because it makes me not do anything, i believe if i quit i will do the online business, ill put all this pressure on my self and ill just make it happen, another reason why id have to quit is because ill be travelling overseas alot too so i couldn't keep my job.

What are your thoughts, since im in this financial position should I just go before its too late ? Before the opportunity is gone ? 

Also atm im 30 single, no kids etc, parents are healthy, im healthy. 
I dont know what the future will bring, if i get in a relationship, if i have a kid etc, this opportunity will be gone ! Also the niche i want to do the older i get the less people will want to watch me do it i suppose as its content heavy, so this is also the opportunity cost the longer i wait the worse, for example i can start now and possibly make it where if i start 5-10 years later in my opinion its too late. 
Also if i have a go for 2 years and it fails i can always come back to a job ( if i have a go for 2 years all out i doubt i wouldn't make it tbh no way) . 

Another thing at this point im so over working a job mentally, for 12 years ive worked 2- 3 jobs absolutely had no life to save and invest, this is how im in this position of 1k a week passive income from investments, so i feel ive put the work in already ! And now i should give my self that chance of having a crack at the online business finally, as i would be quitting on a good financial base and have set my self up before quitting.  

Just for reference i have 2 houses fully paid off, and by the time i quit ill have 200- 250k in a ETF fund that ill leave there so it compounds over time. 

What is everyones thoughts though? 

Thanks. ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1m02kp4/should_i_quit_my_job_and_have_a_go_at_a_online/,1752536930.0,buzzer94,1m02kp4,advice_seeking
