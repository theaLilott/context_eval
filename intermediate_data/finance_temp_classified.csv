personalfinance,invest $1000,How should a 15 year old invest $1000?,Hey i’m kinda new to all this investing stuff and i have 2 jobs right now and no bills to pay so everything goes into my bank account and i want to start investing it but don’t know where to start.

personalfinance,invest $1000,Vanguard silently lowers the expense ratio on 53 ETFs,"**The average expense ratio reduction is 23%.**

The official Vanguard news and announcements URL - [https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/corporatesite/us/en/corp/who-we-are/pressroom/index.html](https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/corporatesite/us/en/corp/who-we-are/pressroom/index.html) \- has made no mention of these changes at the time of writing this post.

Vanguard has reduced the expense ratios (the annual fees you pay) on many of their most popular ETFs. For example, their [Total International Stock ETF (VXUS)](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vxus) now costs just 0.05% per year – down from 0.08%. That’s a 37.5% reduction.

Investors benefit from reduced fees because every dollar saved in fees is a dollar that stays invested and can grow over time. While fees aren’t the only factor to consider when choosing investments, they’re one of the few aspects of investing that you can control. Lower fees mean more of your money stays invested for your future.

You don’t need to take any action to benefit from these lower fees if you already own affected Vanguard ETFs (list below). The reduced expenses will automatically apply to your investments.

personalfinance,small windfall,Small living and now windfall at age 59 … was hoping to retire and now I can?,"Created a new account to remain anonymous. Age 59 and windfall of about 650k due to inheritance. It was already invested and I'm leaving it as is until I get a handle on all the holdings. The person from whom I inherited invested wisely so I think I can wait to sort of grow into it psychologically. 

My personal finances prior to the windfall were minimal but well-controlled. Cash flow from my job has been pretty small all my life-- think around 24k yearly income-- yet I own a home (built it myself since I couldn't afford one otherwise) and I have a small mortgage payment with another 10 years left of payments. Interest on mortgage is 4.5%. No other debt. Property taxes where I live are high though. For assets prior to the windfall, I only had about 35k in my IRAs, and then about 29k in crypto (I know, I know, but it was a gift several years ago and it has done well). And I also have the equity in my home, which I was thinking to use for retirement prior to getting the inheritance. My car has over 200k miles and I'm happy to keep driving it. Oh, and I have a minuscule pension of $86 a month at age 62 from a company I worked at many years ago, and predicted social security of $1169 a month at 62. Since the windfall I have reduced my work to part-time so I will probably  make around $9,000 - $10,000 a year. My lifestyle is pretty frugal-- though not intentionally. No good restaurants near me, so I eat at home, and I never spent  money on entertainment/movies or anything. I lead a pretty quiet lifestyle, though I would like to travel more in retirement. I feel like I might be able to fully retire now? I'm concerned about long-term care (dementia runs in family) and the associated costs since I don't think I  have enough to self-insure (I think I read somewhere you should have 1 million set aside for that?). Also I am concerned about inflation eroding the buying power of the inheritance, though I have to say that with the existing portfolio, it has kept very much ahead of inflation over the years. 

I've read a bit on this sub as well as bogleheads, and have always been pretty good with money myself (probably because I've had to be with my small income!). 

What do you think: can I retire now? Should I? I guess you could say I'm used to living small, and aside from some more travel, right now I don't foresee changing my lifestyle much.

personalfinance,small windfall,Small Windfall- Added a lot of context so keep scrolling to the end if it’s easier,"So I just received a retention bonus from work that vested July 1. It’s not big (think $20K). I’m 40 years old and planned to FIRE to Panama around 2030 all else equal.

Even without this I’m on a good track to FIRE around 2030 - at that time I’ll be 45 with about $700K in Tax-Free (Roths, HSA, etc.) accounts that I plan to just let ride and keep doubling until 65 (so >$2M). I have about $46K a year in lifetime income (which adjusts with SS COLA yearly).

Currently work making ~ $165K ($150 + 11% bonus, sometimes more) and I’m single which affords me the ability to MAX every Roth vehicle I can, which I have and will continue until I actually FIRE).

I have a “Bridge Account” of ETF’s and $100k Cash account. The “Bridge Account I plan on turning into a low-medium-ish risk dividend account to supplement my already recurring yearly $46k mentioned above. I continue to invest $6k/month about 75/25 with the ETF & cash account (mostly SGOV in the “cash account”). Between these 2 accounts it should be somewhere close to $500k by the time I need it (2030) - should also point out I plan to move to Panama when I FIRE. I also have real estate in Dallas with close to $100K net worth; I have golden handcuff mortgage rate so still unsure what I’ll do with that (sell it outright or lease it and hire a property manager).

Sorry for the long-winded detail but thanks if you stayed this far - so back to the $20K “windfall” - part of me is tempted to do something I’d  EVER in a million years do and yeet it into different Yieldmax ETFS. I know the NAV will kill me but apparently with those yields you make your investments back fairly quickly. This would not be a long term holding lol.

personalfinance,small windfall,Advice on small windfall,"I may be receiving a chunk of change due to a life insurance payout. Probably about $70k. Looking for some advice. This is my current plan but am open to suggestions. 



Our current financial situation:

Currently my wife and I take home after 401k/taxes, etc, about $6500 a month. We have a house and our total monthly expenses (Bills. food, gas, etc) are about 5k of that. We generally split the rest between savings and spending. We also have about $15k in debts between a credit card and car loan. 

  
My current thinking:

$15k to pay off debts

$3k to upgrade computers/offices (Both work, hobby, and side business from home computers and this is long overdue)

$10k Emergency Fund in high yield savings account. 

$10k Set aside for 10 year anniversary Europe trip. (We had this saved but spent it on emergency medical expenses in the last month)

$4k On a bedroom set/mattress. Currently using a 10 year old mattress on a $40 bedframe and plastic dresser.

$25K On new car. We've only had 1 for a few years and it can be tough. Plus a nice reliable small SUV would be a big upgrade to our old Corolla. 

$3k Stocks/Investments. Figure we would throw the remaining amount into here. We already have about $10k in this account and add to it each month.



This would allow us to be debt free (Except mortgage) and have 2 fully paid off reliable cars. It also builds us a decent nest egg in adding to what we are currently building and also setting aside a decent sized emergency fund. 

  
Is this a good way to go about it?

personalfinance,small windfall,What would you do with small windfall?,"Between Christmas gifts from parents and a small inheritance from my deceased uncle my husband (32M) and I (31F) have about $8k to play with. Some context:

- No debt besides mortgage, we pay off our credit card every month and I paid off my student loans a few months ago. 

- We have almost a year’s worth of expenses in an emergency fund. 

- Maxed out both our traditional IRAs this year.

- Maxed out our HSA contributions. 

- He contributes up to the match for his employer 401k, I contribute $1k/mo to my 457b. 

- We own our home but don’t really need anything pressing in terms of repairs or maintenance. Same with our car. 

Obviously we are going to have a little fun with some of it, but to be honest we don’t buy a lot of stuff, and we have plenty of disposable income that we use when we do want stuff (combined we take home about $7k/mo, our monthly expenses are about $5k). We also don’t go on big vacations (personal reasons). We do plan on giving a portion to some mutual aid orgs that we work with.

personalfinance,small windfall,Advice for small windfall,"Long story short my mother passed away a few years ago and my father this past Spring. They were definitely not wealthy but my father had a pension that grew to a decent number over 40+ years (a little under $1M) and my 2 siblings and I have now inherited it along with the small amount of money that was part of his estate. 

My primary concern is not getting hammered by taxes while being smart with my withdrawals, needing to distribute the pension funds within 10 years.  Added to this concern is that I'm getting married soon and we'd like to buy a house, and the inherited money would definitely help with the downpayment. I'm also in the midst of getting my MBA and will likely be in a higher tax bracket with a new job in a year or two. And of course I have both undergrad and graduate loans. We also might not be as focused on buying a house if we lived elsewhere, but in our area rents are very high and rising. And we seem unlikely to move anytime soon. 

It doesn't seem like I have any real options other than taking as much of a distribution as I can each year without breaking into a higher tax bracket, which would net me around 72% of the money I think. But I'm open to ideas. 

There's also the lesser issue of the smallish amount of money that went into a family trust and I'm the trustee. I understand there's no rush to distribute the money but the trust will get taxed and at a rather high rate, and when I split the funds with my siblings and distribute them we all get taxed at the normal income rate. There aren't any other real options to help with these tax matters, right?

personalfinance,what to do with extra money,Disputed a Charge and now the merchant is threatening me,"My front windshield of my car got cracked from a baseball. I called around to multiple glass shops to get prices and such. Due to the kind of car I have, it cost extra because of the safety cameras and extra nonsense so everyone said it was an extra 300 dollars to recalibrate it after the windshield if replaced. I settled on a shop, took my car there and they replaced the windshield and called me to pick it up, but said they accidentally broke the molding around the windshield so they had to order new ones (which I got charged for) AND the windshield they put on had a crack on it and they couldn’t get it recalibrated. They told me they would order a new windshield and molding and have me come back in at a later date. I brought my car back in, they replaced the molding and windshield but ended up calling me saying they couldn’t get it recalibrated. So there is a dash alert in my car and I’ll have to take it somewhere else for them to fix it because they couldn’t. Mind you, it worked fine before they replaced it. I assumed they would take off the recalibration fee and the cost of the molding since it was their screw up, but they didn’t. They took off 100 dollars off the price, that’s it. I explained I’m going to have to take it somewhere else and pay for someone else to fix it and if the recalibration fee is 300 why am I only getting 100 off? No budging from them. So once it posted to my credit card, I disputed it with my bank and explained what happened. The glass shop gave their side of the story and I gave mine to the bank and the bank sided with me and gave me the money back. The next day, the glass shop calls me and says they want their windshield back and if I don’t answer my phone and bring it back they will find me, and cut it out of my car. 
I’m worried my car is going to get vandalized at this point because of the unprofessional behavior of them. The only legal thing they can do is take me to court right? What are the chances they would do that and get their money back when the whole thing was a screw up on their part??",993,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1ln34wr/disputed_a_charge_and_now_the_merchant_is/,1751161683.0,RiskNo6531,1ln34wr,advice_seeking

personalfinance,what to do with extra money,Owe 8k in taxes and have never owed before. I'm at a loss.,"Hello. First time posting here. Before this year, I always got at least some money back for taxes. This year WAS my highest-paying year, so I anticipated it, but not EIGHT thousand dollars. For context, we filed jointly married. I worked two jobs, and my husband worked one. I did check that I work multiple jobs in my w4. Outside of that, I have a kiddo but I only claim her every other year (her bio dad got it this year).

Is this normal/just what I should expect? Or what else could lead to such a high cost?

UPDATE: I'm doing my best y'all and am taking the time to learn. We realized our mistakes. I had my w4 as jointly married with multiple incomes. My husband had his single without multiple jobs marked...

Where could one move with a $2,400 monthly income from social security?

For context, and to hopefully avoid a bunch of sarcastic answers, here's the story:

Mom and Dad are in early 60's. Dad worked in the field most of his life, migrated here when he was 8 and essentially got straight to work, so no education. Mom stayed at home most of me and my siblings lives, then began running an in home daycare for the past 10 years for a little extra income. It's a VERY small rural town, she only cares for a few kids at a time and never a big money maker but can bring in some extra few hundred from month to month. The farming company that my dad worked for about 35+ years did not offer a retirement package and due to my parents lack of education (I assume), they just never really looked into alternatives for investment. I don't think either of them even understood what investments were, until I became of age and began to talk to them about it. They basically lived paycheck to paycheck my entire life with no savings or investments.

3 years ago my dad was trying to fix something on one of those big pieces of machinery and destroyed his back. The company (not surprisingly) hired some big shot lawyer and threw him scraps off their table. He got $100k as a settlement. Since then, his body has been in decline and he had to legally wait 24 months to file for any social security benefits, so they lived off the $100k for those two years and the little bit that my mom brings in.

To add to all this, they live in California in a home they purchased in 1985. They STILL. OWE. $100k on it. I know . I know. Apparently, they re-fi'd their home years ago when they were struggling financially and got wrapped up into this f\*cked loan called the ARM loan. If you know anything about that, it should be illegal. Anyway, they don't even live in a house that they have $0 payments on after all this time. So that's about $1,500 payment.

So, my parents are in their early 60's. My dad cannot work, he's truly disabled and my mom with only a GED brings in a little extra cash some times with babysitting. They live off $2,200 a month, plus whatever little change is leftover from that shitty settlement. Mortgage is $1500, Car is $300, groceries, gas, utilities.. you do the math.

I am telling them that they need to sell the house and move to an apartment somewhere. They are sitting on an asset (maybe $500k total value, so net $400k-ish?) and there's NO way they would ever afford any repairs if something broke in the home. But with the cost of rent, I'm not even sure this is the best advice. If you were me, what would you advise them? If it's sell the house and move to a cheaper cost of living state, where would that be?

personalfinance,what to do with extra money,I think I finally understand Backdoor Roth IRA and why everyone seems to constantly say you need to do it.,"Please anyone feel free to correct me! 
I (36M) am making this post as it has been hard to find things that aligned with my thoughts. 

I have spent a while trying to figure out if doing a backdoor roth is even worth it compared to dumping it in my normal brokerage account and it hadn’t really seemed worth it. I finally had the epiphany last night. 

With my taxable brokerage account a best case scenario (for me) would be long term capital gains at 15%. 
Worst case pending where life takes me would be up to 24%+ 

However by doing a backdoor Roth my worst case would be I need money and I withdraw contributions before the 5 years is up and it’s a flat 10% penalty and that is it… 
And a more likely case if nothing crazy happens is that I need money and I’ve hit the 5 year and I can just take my contributions out as needed as long as I don’t touch any growth or funds less than 5 years old…  

So overall it seems whether or not I need money in a year and one day or I need it in 35 years by having the Roth as an option it would be 5-24%+ difference in actual money… before I thought I’m not rich so a couple percent inefficiency doesn’t move the needle but now I realize it’s much more than a couple percent. 

I have been fortunate enough these last couple years to be in a place I can max my 401k and my HSA and still be able to have some left over to invest so it has always been a “is it worth the hassle to do a conversion and to have an extra account to track” and it finally appears to be a resounding yes. Given retirement is 30 years away that’s been a hard concept to grasp of what I may need then etc so looking at it in a 1-10 year timeframe for me made all the difference. 

I hope others that are starting out find this useful as well and I hope anyone that has been doing this a while can expose any inaccuracies in my thought process.

personalfinance,what to do with extra money,Need help with analyzing my budget and what to do with extra money,"My(25M) current roommate will be leaving in about 1–4 months. Before they move out, I'll have about $700 more available monthly than my current budget shows. I just had my yearly review at my job, where they said I exceed expectations, so I feel like I have good job security. Attached below is my budget after my roommate leaves.

Plan:

* I do not want to get another roommate, I work out of my bedroom, so I want to have an office once my roommate leaves
* I plan to put $700/month into savings until I build up $7k–$10k. I just started saving last month, so it'll likely take 9 months to save up before focusing on debt.
* After that, I plan to start tackling smaller debts. My student loans have about 9 years left, if I don't do additional payments.
* I plan to put all mileage reimbursement money toward early car payments but since that amount varies between $0–$150/month, I don't include it in my core budget. But since my car is on a 6 year loan, I hope that I can at least shorten the length of my term.

Questions:

* What should I do with the extra $700/month until my roommate leaves — put it toward debts or savings?
* Overall, does my budget seem healthy?

personalfinance,what to do with extra money,Making the most money I’ve ever made at 25,"Hello! I’m a male living with parents, just this year alone with 2 jobs I’ve made good money, in my eyes this is what I mean. 

I work at a dealership and I’ve yet to not atleast hit $6k a month, but I work at part time job that gets me $3k extra a month, on a good streak I can make over 10k this is after taxes. I am almost done paying all of my credit cards and have no debt to my name. I started the year at $-1.00, and I’ve saved up to 15k now after paying off most of my debt. 

I haven’t bought myself anything not even shoes and I do eat out everyday but it never goes over $20. Cars paid off. And I give my parents $750 a month for myself to be there.

So my dilemma is this: I plan on moving out in a year or two, I would really like to upgrade my car and get something nice for myself, but I don’t want it to affect me buying a house later. I also don’t know if I should keep money aside for anything. Essentially I am lost when it comes to having money because I’ve never had this much and would really just like some feedback on what good next steps would be. If you were in my shoes.

My employer does not subsize my spouse’s medical premiums, so I pay $1,500 pre-tax monthly for medical + dental. When he turns 65 next year, he’s going on Medicare.

Question: Where should I put this extra money?

Spouse is retired and has $2.3 million in a 401K.

I currently have $860K in a Rollover IRA, $115K in a brokerage account, $22K in my company’s 401K. I earn $32/hour, but I’ve always been good about saving money. I currently save 20% pre-tax and I get a 4% match at the end of the year. I don’t have any extra money at the end of the month, so I cannot increase my savings at the moment.

In 2026, my spouse will go on Medicare and he wants me to retire at the end of 2029 when I turn 56. The house will be paid off at the end of 2028 and we will have to keep up on property taxes and maintenance. We have no other debts.

Should I increase my 401K contribution or save my after-tax dollars to bridge the gap from early retirement to age 65, since I will need to cover my medical premiums?

personalfinance,bonus invest,How should I invest my signing bonus,"**Background**: During Covid, my SO and I moved from a HCOL area to a MCOL area. In 2021, my employer introduced hybrid RTTO but offered a remote option with a COL adjustment, which I took in order to stay in the MCOL area. In 2023 we purchased a house and had a baby. The house needed some renovations which we weren't able to fund completely but we made enough updates to make it livable before moving in. In 2024, my employer began enforcing full time RTTO, giving everyone a 90 day window to adjust. I wasn't able to secure another job in that period, so we ended up moving back to the HCOL city in a rush and moved into an apartment in a relatively affordable area. Shortly after, I was able to find a better opportunity in the HCOL city, with a hybrid schedule and much better pay. They also offered me a pretty good sign on bonus and decent RSU options which will vest by the end of the year.

My bonus will be deposited in about a month and I'm wondering how we should invest it. Below are the main options we're thinking about:

**Option 1**: Finish the renovations on the house we purchased in the MCOL area and begin renting it out. Pros: Obviously helps pay the house's mortgage and increases our monthly cash flow. Cons: We don't have the bandwidth to manage tenants and aren't sure how straightforward it is to deal with property managers. We also travel to the MCOL city quite a bit due to my SO's work and it's nice to have a place there. 

**Option 2**: Pay off the house. Pros: Improves our credit scores and gives us more leverage to, say, apply for a HELOC and spend it on renovations. Cons: We still have to think about how to manage a property remotely. 

**Option 3**: Sell the house in the MCOL area, and, combined with the bonus, apply it towards purchasing a new house in the HCOL area. Pros: Allows us to move into a much better school district. Our toddler is now 2 so we have to start planning for school over the next 2-3 years. Cons: The MCOL city is something we've always wanted to move back to as soon as I'm able to find a decent job out there. It's also much more climate-safe than where we are right now so we are hesitant about buying a place in our current city. Also as I mentioned above, we still travel to the MCOL area quite frequently. 

We're thought about holding off on option 3 until the RSU vests because that might give us additional leverage, but here's always a risk that the RSU won't pay off as much as we expect it to (especially given the current economic situation).

What would you suggest I do?,"I (28yr old dude) work part time for a small business in Southern California, and also help the owners with their personal bookkeeping. I'm pretty much their all-around guy. Owners are married and own the S-Corp. One of their parents died, and they recieved a $360k non qualified annuity which they decided to pull out as a lump sum. Not wanting to pay high taxes, they did a lot of stuff, including put some money into the S-Corp and gave me a bonus of $60,000. Their accountant encouraged this and I was totally speechless. They like me a lot, and want me to stick around helping them with the business and their personal lives until their deaths. Theyre in their 70's. The bonus was sort of a retainer for keeping me around and a way for them to write off the losses in their business and have it carryover into their personal.

That's the backstory for how someone who has lived with no savings or investments has suddenly come up on a huge sum of cash, and has no idea what to do next.

Things I understand:

\- Big chunk will go to taxes as withholdings, I already anticipate this, and until I get a solid number from a tax professional, I'm ready to send off $40k for withholdings. Side note: They wrote me a check instead of doing it through our payroll processor, and so now I have to have fun trying to send that money to the Fed and State on my own...

\- I should put some of it into a HYSA

\- Maybe try to open up a trad. IRA before tax day (hoping this would help reduce my taxes on this while also putting the money somewhere safe)

\- invest some of it? this is the part I know less about, and don't really anticipate becoming an investment/stocks head. However I know there are options for me to have someone else handle those decisions.

personalfinance,getting started investing,Question about social security should I wait or start getting it at 62,"I recently reached level 59 and logged into my social security account. 

It says that at 62 I can get $2081 a month, at 65 I will get 2,666 and at 70 I will get 3295. I am assuming that is the highest amount not counting any COLA increases each year. 

What is the best way to calculate whether it would be more advantageous to start at 62 and invest in a HYSA or wait until I can get the full amount? I would calculate the amount at 65 also.

personalfinance,getting started investing,Is it too early to get into high dividend yield investments?,"I’m a recent college graduate (22M) and an accountant, doing this line of work (tax) I see a lot of successful people and what they have for income. Particularly, older people with high dividends. My question is, is it a bad thing for me to invest in something like Vanguard High DVD Yield ETF in a brokerage account and set this to reinvest all gain/dividends? My thing is, I see people making half a million dollars a year RETIRED with a lot of interest income and dividend income. I have IRA accounts, a brokerage account, savings accounts (generic and HYSA), but is it bad for me to start putting money into this income focused investments at such a young age?

Edit: these wouldn’t be my only investments, and although I’m an accountant I’m not a finance/investment guru. I currently put away about 20% of my income across workplace retirement plans as well as personal retirement plans/investment accounts. Part of the reason I’ve done more research on this and have asked this question is because my state got rid of interest/dividend tax (NH, no income tax so only I/D tax is federal) so I’ve been looking more heavily into interest/dividends.

personalfinance,getting started investing,I Spent Years Optimizing My Finances—Then I Realized What I Was Missing,"For a long time, I believed that if I just saved and invested wisely, everything else would fall into place. I tracked my spending, optimized my ETF portfolio, and avoided unnecessary expenses. I told myself I was building for the future—financial freedom, options, security.

And in many ways, I was. But then I noticed something:

While my bank balance grew, my life wasn’t necessarily getting better.

I put off trips because I wanted to save more.
I hesitated to buy a new mattress, even though my old one sucked.
I skipped social events because I thought they were a “waste” of money.

At first, it felt responsible. Then it felt empty.

I was optimizing for security, not for happiness. And security is only half the equation.

So, I started making small changes:

I bought a quality mattress because good sleep is an investment.

I traveled, not recklessly, but without overanalyzing every expense.

I let myself spend money on things that actually improved my life—not just my future net worth.


The crazy part? I didn’t regret any of it.

I still save. I still invest. But I also live. Because money is just a tool—and a tool you never use is useless.

I want to learn about investing money, trading stocks, etc not because I want to be rich but because I want to try and have some kind of safety net for the future. I have been reading some online forums about stocks vs bonds and kinds other investments, but I often see people making a sizable investment up front. I understand the concept of ""spend money to make money,"" but what if all I have to get started today is $20?

I have no idea where to really start. I can read all the forums, watch all the youtube econ videos, but I just don't know what the first move to make would be.

I am starting graduate school soon and will be living on 30k/year. I did some budget calculating and after taxes (oh god the taxes), rent, bills and utilities, and groceries with ABSOLUTELY ZERO FRIVOLOUS SPENDING, I will have maybe 200 a month to put into savings. I could contribute more, small amounts of money to this hypothetical account in the future once I start my new program, but for right now, I have $20.

I was wondering if anybody had some advice/has ever been in a similar spot, or even any additional resources you might recommend. Thank you!

personalfinance,how much to save,What do you do after your emergency fund is depleted?,"I was laid off in April. I had 3 months of savings, now depleted, and I won't be able to pay my mortgage next month. I have applied to over 400 jobs with a decent amount of interviews. What can I actually do? 

Editing to add relevant details: 

I am on unemployment. My unemployment will last 2-3 more months. One month of unemployment does not cover my mortgage. I am ineligible for any other public services, such as food stamps or Medicaid. I am uninsured. My unemployment is roughly 20% of my prior salary.

I have done all the things I should have done after being laid off - filed for unemployment, contacted my banks and credit card companies, cancelled all subscriptions and memberships, even refilled my expensive prescriptions before my insurance ended. Did you know that one inhaler - one month of use - is $600 without insurance? 

I have already contacted my mortgage company, but they cannot do anything until I miss a payment. Then, I can apply for hardship, but it is unclear whether that would be a full deference or a few hundred dollars off the mortgage. I would not know until I start the process. 

I wish I could have saved more than a 3-month emergency fund, but this is my third layoff in three years. I'm lucky that I was able to save up just 3 months worth of money. The first time I was unemployed, I took out a personal loan. The second time, I cashed out my 401k. I do not have much leverage with loans at this point. A HELOC is my absolute last resort. I have only owned my home for 3 years, so it will not be a substantial loan and I will have nothing once that is exhausted. 

I live in a HCOL area and I work in tech (hence the repeated lay-offs). I am applying to any and all relevant jobs in my field. I would like to get a job outside of tech, but that is not really up to me in this job market. I will accept the first offer I get. My interview stats are pretty solid for my field. Unless you have similar experience, there is no reason to comment on my job search. This is a personal finance subreddit - not a career judgement one.

While I would love to get a side job in the meantime, my unemployment will decrease with every dollar I earn. My unemployment cannot cover my bills, but it is more than I would earn from a part-time, minimum-wage job. This is not MY choice - it is just how it works. And yes, I can and do work for cash but that's not going to cut it. Please see this comment for a better explanation: https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1liiqtb/comment/mzcn3gy/

Some commentors are saying the math doesn't add up. I don't know what to tell you other than I had 3 months of money saved up, and the end of that 3 months will be July 1. I can scrape together all of the money for my other bills to pay my mortgage, obviously, but then I'll be defaulting on loans and credit cards - again. My credit is wrecked. And no, I can't ask family - they are abusive - I haven't spoken to them since I turned 18.

I am looking for answers other than the obvious 'get a part-time job' and 'file for unemployment.' I am steps ahead of that. I am hoping someone has some niche or other idea that might work for me.

I liked Die with Zero but only recommend it as a balance to the books the heavily emphasis saving and investing.

  
This got me reflecting on my grandparents. They essentially gave me my inheritance from 18-30. I received between $5000-15,000/year during that period and I'd estimate it at little over $100k in total. I  took hard course loads in college and worked throughout but they gave me enough money that I didn't have to take out student loans, I had money to buy an engagement ring, and money for a downpayment on first house (though it was 2008 and the house cost $125k). 

When my grandma died last year, there wasn't much left in her estate. My grandparents gave in a perfect way where there was no strings attached. They grew up in the depression and worked blue collar jobs but lived modestly and saved. At 40, a home owner with a good career and a happy marriage I can't help but feel gratitude and wonder where I would be if they hadn't done that. 

I like using the 4% rule for estimating how much to save for financial independence goals but those models all assume you're going to end with a chunk of money at the end. I'm beginning to shift my thoughts of ending with just enough to cover my retirement home expenses till 95 and trying to give more to my kids in the 18-30 year range. They're 12-16 right now. 

Curious how others think about this. What assumptions do you use for withdrawal rates or savings if you plan on giving out ""inheritances"" when you're still living?

personalfinance,how much to save,78-year-old mother has $600 a month income from Social Security and that’s it I don’t know what to do,"Edit Update:  thank you also so very, very, very much for your kindness, and your time. Your suggestions have given me a lot to think about. I think my sister and I need to sit down with an estate attorney and really go over all of these options thoroughly. I really can’t thank you all enough for spending time here with me tonight to help me and my family. You all seem like very wonderful people and I’m grateful for all of you. I hope you have a wonderful rest of your evening.

Original Post:

My mom worked for herself for years with a home daycare, so she didn’t put much into Social Security apparently. I don’t exactly know how that works to be honest. But she gets about $600 a month and that’s it.

She has Medicare, and no supplemental insurance and no drug coverage.

She divorced my dad when I was about three years old and he took off and disappeared. I found him about 15 years ago and then he passed away. I am in my early 50s.

My sister and I were the recipients of a little bit of money after my dad died because he was in a lawsuit that he ended up winning. We got my mom a used car and each contributed $7000 to that, and gave her and my grandmother each a check for $14,000 because they took care of us without any financial support from our father and that was the least we could do. This was about 10 years ago. 

My grandmother was living then, and she had her late husband‘s military retirement and her own Social Security, so between the three incomes, and my sister giving my mom $500 a month and me giving my grandmother $500 a month they were doing OK.

Grandmom sadly passed away at the age of 103 at the end of 2022. Beyond the grief, that left my mother with $600 a month of Social Security and $1000 from her two daughters put together to live on every month. 

I encouraged her to apply for Medicaid. Because of the money in her savings account she does not qualify. The house is paid for as my grandmother paid cash for it back in 1971 when it was a new build. 

My mother cannot work. She is not in the best health. She also does not go to the doctor but that’s a whole different subject.

I am currently not in a situation where I can continue to pay her $500 every single month. But she needs it. She currently doesn’t have insurance on the house as there is no one in Florida writing for it right now in the condition that it’s in. GrandMom‘s home insurance of course dropped coverage when she passed away and the house was built in 1971 and will need work to be up to code in a couple of areas to pass the four-point inspection. We already paid for a new roof, but it has the old wiring that I don’t know if the plumbing would pass inspection.

My understanding is that if my mother was to qualify for SSI and Medicaid she would have to first spend all of her savings down. My understanding is that the house would not count against her as an asset as she is living there and it’s already paid for.

I have no idea what to do. My sister and I are really struggling right now to continue with the money that we promised to pay her to help support her. She is not living extravagantly at all. She has canceled every subscription including Amazon prime. She has no cable television or streaming services, no newspaper no magazines nothing like that. She has one cell phone no landline. She never runs the central heat or air she uses a window unit in her room for AC in the summer and a Space heater in her room in the winter. 

She pays for car insurance registration and gas and repairs, electricity, cell phone, Internet service (very basic slow cheapest one they had), groceries, water sewer trash. As I said before she doesn’t go to the doctor so she doesn’t have medical expenses. She or a neighbor takes care of the yard.

It worries me that the house has no insurance but I cannot afford to get the whole thing rewired and I cannot afford to get new plumbing. 

I guess the TLDR is that she can’t work, she’s not in great health, my sister and I are stretched to the limit in giving her $500 a month each and getting a new roof recently for the house, (it was literally leaking and there was black mold at about 15 or 18 years old I think, so there was no choice), she currently does not qualify for SSI or Medicaid because of the $14,000 given to her that has grown a little bit in her Discover savings account.

If anyone has any suggestions at all I am all ears. I think she’s gonna end up having to move in with one of us actually, but without sharing too much, that would be the very last resort as she was a very abusive parent and we are caring for her because we are being daughters. Living with her would be a nightmare but if that has to happen it has to happen.

PS this is in Florida and we all live within about 20 minutes of each other. My sister and I both work full-time. We physically visit once a week and help out with any chores or items needing fixing that we can help with.

I’m hesitant to even hit post here because I really don’t think there’s an answer but maybe someone here will have some ideas?

personalfinance,savings rate,Laid off with stay-at-home wife and 3 kids and a mortgage...,"Throwaway account - felt too personal

Got laid off a couple of months ago. Severance and health insurance will keep me afloat until Dec. 31st and I'm on my own starting 2025 unless I land a job. I have very little cash savings, but do have $500k in 401k, home equity of about $300k (30 year interest rate is 3.1% so I'd rather not refinance). My $3k mortgage covered property tax and home insurance. Estimates on CalCovered (health insurance) is $2,000 for a family of 5. I suspect that would be reduced if I'm unemployed? I need a minimum of $6-7k/ month to cover necessities. No car payments, very little credit card debt. Been working since I was 16 and this is totally new to me and very anxious. My wife was a stay-at-home mom and is now looking into getting back in the workforce.

My question if I stay unemployed. What's the best way to navigate my retirement money. I'm just preparing for the worst and have 6 weeks to figure this out. Appreciate any recommendations.

Additional information - EDIT  
I am collecting unemployment.   
I am trying to find any job regardless of industry or pay.   
I am willing to take on part time/ gig jobs/ neighborhood help, etc.   
I have looked at budgeting and have eliminated non-essentials. I could do better.   
I have until end of year for severance and health insurance, but I think I can squeeze 3 more months to Q1. 

I need to get back to hustling and will come back to the thread tonight. Man, I can't thank you all enough for the suggestions, the encouragement and just the overall time you all have put in to help out a stranger.

I do want to pay off my credit cards, but spending my entire savings account in one go is painful and worries me incase some major emergency happens.

What should I do? Pay off half? Pay off all of it? Keep my savings and keep chunking away at it?

Thank you all for the advice, I plan to pay off my Paypal/Capital One immediately, do a balance transfer from my bank card to a card with a 0% APR for at least 15 months and have it paid off before that ends.

personalfinance,savings rate,What I learned after tracking expenses for 2+ years,"Hey everyone! I've been tracking my expenses for the past 2 years, increased my savings 8 times, and I wanted to share some unexpected insights that might help others.

**1. Inflation is way more personal than headlines suggest**

I always read about inflation rates, but never noticed it in “real life”. After about a year of tracking expenses, I discovered this. It’s hard to track based on weeks or even months, and I really faced that after \~1 year. With the same expenses, the same quality of life level without any significant changes, I can’t fit my budget anymore. This realization was pretty disappointing. I was even thinking about stopping any budgeting and tracking activities. But that’s not the way, after a few days I returned to my normal state and decided to focus on increasing my income instead of abandoning my tracking habits.  
(my old tracking sheet after budget adjusting: [https://imgur.com/oweKCyc](https://imgur.com/oweKCyc))

**2. ""Normal months"" are rare - and that's normal**

One of my biggest revelations was that there's no such thing as a ""typical month."" Looking at my data:

* Some months were 30% over budget due to unexpected car repairs
* Other months were surprisingly under budget.
* Holidays and birthdays always threw things off.
* Medical expenses came out of nowhere.

The key learning: Build a buffer for these ""surprise"" months. They're actually not surprises - they're part of life. “Emergency fund” is a must-have, but it’s not a magic pill, don’t rely on it too much.  
(my February nightmare, s\*\*t happens, just keep going: [https://imgur.com/WXyb5ix](https://imgur.com/WXyb5ix))

**3. Impulse buying becomes harder when you track**

This was unexpected, but knowing I'd have to log purchases made me think twice about random buys. I simply don’t want to see those red numbers in my green budget life. Of course, it doesn’t save you millions (actually depends on your income/expenses, but not my case). It is more about preventing spending more.

**4. Finally understand where my money ACTUALLY goes**

Before tracking, I had this vague idea about my spending. Now I know:

* My ""cheap"" coffee habit was actually $180/month. (Dropped it to \~50 after a year)
* Subscriptions were eating $85/month (that’s a hard thing to deal with, but at least it doesn’t grow for now)
* I was spending way more on food delivery than I thought.
* Weekend activities were 2x more expensive than I estimated. I do not have children, it is just me, my partner, and a dog. I can not imagine the children’s impact on that.

**5. Adjust**

Adjust, adjust everything, and find your comfort zone. Do not set hard limits without knowing your actual spending. First several months **must be** “testing” months. You should get to know your habits, your money, your expenses. Do not set unrealistic limits. You will be disappointed when you go over that number. Instead, be curious about your spending, investigate them. Just live an everyday life. But set in advance the duration of the period. 2-3 months worked well for me, I think that period is crucial not to drop all that expense-budgeting things.

**6. Peace of mind?**

I do not think you can achieve real peace of mind with all that. However, you can gain control over your finances. I have never considered the connection between my psychological state and budgeting. Those two years were tough for me, and my expense-tracking habit was a small part of my stability. But it depends on your personality.

**Conclusion**

Tracking expenses is truly impactful, and it has really changed my life. Those 2 years were not my first try. I have tried several times before, but all of them have been unsuccessful. Maybe I was too young (I’m 27 now), or there were other reasons for that. I’ve been working full time since I was 20, and for the first 5 years, I had less than 8k in savings. Now, after 2 years it is 8 times more. I can't attribute everything to budgeting and tracking expenses, but it helped 100%. Most of my money is in stocks and ETFs, so I do not have any short-term plans for them.

**Tips for anyone starting:**

* Start simple - just track everything for a month.
* Don't judge yourself in the beginning.
* Focus on patterns, not individual purchases.
* Be consistent with categories.
* Do not automatically import transactions from the bank, enter them manually.
* Use tools that don't feel like work.

**What's next?**

I will continue to track my spending. And I have a few more ideas about budget optimization and hacks to save money. I will test them this year and hopefully I will be able to increase my savings even more without any downgrades.

personalfinance,savings rate,Should I sell my home in the Caribbean to buy a house in the U.S. and become debt-free?,"Hey everyone, I’m 33M, married with two kids (ages 10 and 6), and I’ve been living in Connecticut since 2011. I'm a U.S. citizen and work full-time in the trucking industry, earning about $60,000/year.

Back in 2019, I used profits from trading stocks to help buy a house in my home country in the Caribbean. I put down about $130,000 cash and took a mortgage for the remaining ~$130K. It was actually my mother’s idea—she had plans around the property too, but sadly, she passed away a year later. That’s part of why the property means something to me, but at the same time, it hasn’t been a great financial move since then.

Right now, that home is worth around $425,000, and I still owe about $130,000. I’ve been renting it on Airbnb, but after mortgage, HOA fees, utilities, housekeeping, and management, I only make around $600/month profit, and even less in off-seasons. It’s been stressful to manage remotely, and there’s added pressure now—my HOA has threatened to shut down Airbnb rentals, so the future income is uncertain.

Worse, the mortgage is variable and currently at 10.5% interest, with no fixed-rate or refinance options available locally. That rate has climbed steadily, making the house even less financially viable.

Meanwhile in the U.S., I’ve got about $30K in credit card and personal loan debt, and I’m currently renting. So I’m thinking about selling the Caribbean house, paying off the mortgage, and walking away with about $265K net.

Here’s my plan if I sell:

Put 20% down on a $66K)

Pay off all my debts (~$30K)

Start college funds for my kids

Invest ~$75K in index funds or CDs

Keep ~$20K in high-yield savings for emergencies

Use income from work to build a future home back home slowly, debt-free


I’d be left with no debt except a U.S. mortgage, a stable home for my family, and room to save and grow.

I like having something back home, but with everything considered—the limited income, rising interest, remote stress, and life here—it’s feeling more like a weight than an asset.

Would you sell and start fresh? Or am I giving up long-term value too soon?

  I made a very mad choice a few years ago to get a heloc I finished my landscaping got solar panels and a few other odds and ends home improvements.  
  My heloc is variable apr around 7.5% it was only like 3.5 when I first got it.  Now Its everything I can do to make my minimum payment intrest only payment on the heloc.  Me and my wife both drive old paid for cars with high miles we are one emergency away from not being able to pay the bills. 
  Is there any options to lower my monthly payments?
  I thought about getting one of those 0% introductory rate credit cards and transferring as much as I get approved for from the heloc to the credit card thus lowering my heloc payment and actually paying down the principal on the credit card.  Is this a bad idea it's all I could come up with to reduce my debt.
Edit:
I have so much equity in my home because I built it myself and my father in law gave us the land so we could live next to them.

Budget: 2300 mortgage with escrow, 600 utilities, 540 heloc, 700 food and other necessities. Oh also owe 6k on student loan payment is about $100  also have cell phones, fuel, kids activities, car insurance. Income is about $6k take home.  My wife doesn't work right now because we have two year old twins and her income was about equal to what daycare would have cost she wasn't making much as a receptionist before we had the twins.
 
I would love to sell our home but we promised my father in law we would stay there next to him so I could help him on his farm. when he gave us the land. 
 I know the heloc was a dumb move but at the time I thought I could refinance my home and pay off the heloc then interests rates started going up and never stoped.  It just doesnt feel like I have any good options.  I had a second job driving a trash truck last year but I wasn't sleeping enough due to only being home 4 or 5 hours a day and fell asleep driving and got into an accident. 
Edit #2
I appreciate all the responses.   As others noted I don't know where my money is going and I don't have a real budget I just know its all spent every month.  So Im going to make a real budget with the wife.   Im going to make cuts to expenses.  Golf, home projects other non essentials.  I listed my mtn bike for sale.  I also reduced 457k contributions and Im going to start  donating plasma. That should give me more than $1000 a month to put on debt. Im gonna put the first $2000 in a savings account in case an emergency comes along.  And after that Im going to start chipping away at the heloc.   Maybe if rates go down someday I'll lock in a fixed rate second mortgage to pay replace the heloc but until then its gonna be slowly plugging along.  I think based on the comments that people are under the impression I currently am behind on payments and going to lose my house.  Thats not the case I have never had a late payment on anything in my life.  Im just stressed and overwhelmed about the mess I got myself in and paying interest only on the heloc at the moment.

personalfinance,savings rate,Buying a condo was the WORST financial decision,"File this under “it seemed like a good idea are the time.”

TLDR: it’s a money pit, depreciating asset, feel stuck, afraid I will have to sell or rent at a loss. 

I bought a small condo in 2021 in a HCOL area. I had been renting it from an elderly landlady who wanted to sell the place and retire from property management. I thought I had found a gem: it was rent controlled when I was renting ($1300) and the sale price ($181K) seemed like a nice, affordable little starter home for a young single woman. And the 2.9 interest rate didn’t hurt either. I got assistance from the county’s first time homebuyer program, and because the landlady sold it directly to me, I was able to avoid a lot of the realtor costs (just regular closing) and didn’t have to compete on the market. 

Fast forward to 2025. I’m no longer single. With two people and a dog, the place is quite crowded. We want to get out, but we feel stuck. Partner is moving in with me because he rents and I own, his rent is more expensive than my mortgage, and his place is not dog-friendly but mine is. We figure if we grit through living in this small (600 square feet, but at least it has direct access to the backyard and its own outdoor patio) place and split the expenses we can save for a year or two and move out. 


But this place is a MONEY PIT and it DOES NOT APPRECIATE in value. I’ll spare the details of everything that’s wrong with it, but among the worst: the laundry room doorway was BUILT AROUND a stackable washer dryer unit that broke, and was too old to be serviced, and I had to dismantle the unit to take it out, and only the tiniest of tiny compact washer/dryers can fit. The doorway cannot be widened without moving a radiator, which cannot be done without a licensed plumber…among a ton of other major, no-fault-of-my-own plumbing issues from very old and wonky pipes, they can’t be addressed on their own because… the building does not have individual shutoff valves for each unit. When any plumbing or heating work is done, they have to shut down the whole building (10 units), which only a licensed professional can do, and it is very expensive. There is so much wrong with this place that wasn’t visible from the surface. So much internally, architecturally, structurally wrong. But the kind of thing you don’t notice until you need to fix or replace something. I was 30 years old and thought this place was a good opportunity to own my own home and adopt a dog. And not have to move. 

The necessary repairs we need to do to make it liveable, and especially rentable, are in excess of $15,000. That’s money we don’t have right now without going into our emergency funds or going into debt. And it looks like I won’t even make that money back in sales or rental income. The history of the place’s value has flatlined if not decreased. 

Getting on the property ownership ladder really isn’t worth it unless you can buy a house. Homeownership is also not for everyone. I miss the freedom of having someone else take care of and pay for crap that breaks, and to just be able to move at the end of a lease if I want to.

The gist: After rebounding from unemployment six months ago, I have been saving surplus money from contract jobs to a one-year emergency fund. I kept 4K in a CD, while the rest...went into VTI and VTSAX. I was unaware of how much cash I should really keep liquid, it was a mistake.

Current situation: My tax-exempt savings accounts were all maxed out first, so I have 25K bouncing around in VTI in my taxable brokers account. I have been throwing every penny at it for months, literally down to any spare dollar. I'm about 1500 away from having my one-year fund complete, but that fluctuates because of the market value. I want this 'done' so it's frustrating that I whiffed this badly, but so be it.

So. Now what? Should I...

A. Wait for a slightly 'better' market week, sell off some VTI to keep in a HYSA or CD. Six months of expenses?

B. Do not sell, just focus the rest of my surplus on liquid savings and end up with about 5500 on-hand.

C. Do not sell, focus rest of savings on liquid, and then basically start from scratch to try and set aside six months of liquid funding while leaving the VTI stash as-is?

personalfinance,build emergency fund,Taking personal loan to build emergency fund,"Before you react, just hear me out.
My wife (26F) and myself (27M) are expecting our firstborn any day now. (Due date Aug 10)
My wife is taking her 12 week maternity leave starting on Monday (Aug 4th)
We live in NY, which means for that 12 weeks, she will be receiving 67% of her normal paycheck.
Current incomes (Net)
Myself: $5,500
Wife: $4,300
Combined Net income after taxes, insurance, retirement etc.: $9,800
No CC debt, both have low interest vehicle loans, and mortgage payment is $1,000/mo
Current emergency fund savings: $7,500 (I wish this was a lot higher, just got done paying off the last of our credit cards in preparation for the baby.

So my dilemma is, right now we have a great combined income. With the hit to my wife’s salary over the next 3 months and possibly even losing her income for the next 12 months (We have considered having her stay home with the baby for the first year) I am feeling uneasy about having less than $10,000 in the bank for an emergency fund

Should I for instance get laid off from my job, and my wife not currently working Im concerned that emergency fund would get eaten up incredibly quickly and we could run the risk of missing a mortgage payment.

As of right now I can easily afford all of our combined bills with just my income, I just am always concerned with potential job loss and an extended subsequent job search.

I currently have a personal loan offer for 2 years, at 7% int. 

Is it completely unreasonable to take this personal loan now to have a solid emergency fund built up as we navigate an uncertain next few months?

Thanks so much

personalfinance,build emergency fund,Should I save an emergency fund and pay off debt before funding retirement?,"
I’m a new grad nurse making ~90k yearly in the south. Pre tax is around $7000 monthly. I currently have about 2k left on my car, $3500 in CC debt and $16k student loans that are deferred until November. My current expenses 
Rent + utilities $1000
Car + insurance & gas $520
*phone bill is paid by my parents 
I’m thinking of paying off my credit cards before my student loans start to ease the load a little bit and also paying down my car by the end of the year so that my only debt is my student loans. During this time I also want to start saving. 
Regarding retirement I don’t plan to contribute much until after my loans are paid off and I have build up my savings. 
My current plan is to contribute 2-3% to 401k, $50-$100 to my HSA and 2% to Roth IRA. Bringing my total retirement contributions to 7%. I understand this is lower than the recommended amount of 15% but I think it’s a start to start contributions while maximizing my other goals. Any advice on how to set up my budgets or retirement is greatly appreciated!

I have been incredibly irresponsible with money and it took me a looong time to grow up! My eyes have magically opened this year and things are making more sense. I've just started budgeting! 

I'm projected to pay off all of my debt by the end of 2027. If I care less about my student loans ($20k, just pay the minimums?) then I could have the main bulk of my debt paid off by end of 2026. $2100 per month for \~20 months.

personalfinance,saving for retirement,Been working for 15 years and have almost nothing saved except retirement,"
I’m 33 and have nothing saved outside of retirement. I started making $21 at my first real “career” job at 23, and now I’m 32 and earning $45, but I still have nothing. I lived at home until 27. I’ve never bought a new car or any big-ticket items except for a new motorcycle ($7,000), which I sold after a year. I always spent my money on little things—mainly nicotine and marijuana products, eating out, or items costing $100, $200, or $300, sometimes more. If it was under $1,000, it didn’t stress me out too much. I always had a new phone and carried around $2,000 or $3,000 in debt. I spend money like water; my thought process is, “I’ll have more next week.” I know it’s the wrong way of thinking, but I just didn’t care, and it’s ruining my life. It’s bad.

My mindset is starting to change. I recently quit my bad habits, and reality is hitting hard, especially after doing the math on paper. I’m realizing how long it’s going to take to save up and how much I could have had if I’d just saved half of everything.

I need a plan before my girlfriend realizes I’m a loser and leaves me, and before I’m too old and unattractive. 
I have $55,000 in my 401(k), $60,000 in a Roth IRA, and $22,000 in an HSA. Outside of retirement, I have $4,000 in XRP and $1,500 in my checking account. My credit card balances total $2,100. I make $45 an hour and contribute $180 to my 401(k) right now, nothing to my Roth IRA, and $84 to my HSA. I have a 2004 Tacoma and a 2012 Honda Accord, both paid off. My portion of rent is $1,000, and my bills are about $400 a month.
I need to fix my life. I can work 15 hours of overtime if needed. I just need a plan to stop feeling like a loser. How fucked am i? I wanted to buy a house and start a family before im in my late 30s. Also im a high cost of living state. My one bedroom with 1.5 bath is $2000 and thats pretty cheap around here. Houses start at 500k. I don’t even know where to start.

personalfinance,saving for retirement,What's the best way to save for my parents' retirement?,"My wife and I both grew up poor and now make what is, to us, a lot of money - about 160 combined. Between us we have 3 parents still living, all in their late 60s, average health, and still working low-income jobs. We have always known we'll be responsible for them when they can no longer work - but I don't know what the most effective way to save money for that eventuality is.

A little more info on the parents, in case that's relevant:

Wife's mom: Has a small retirement fund from her factory job of 30 years. lives in a paid-off house that is in bad shape (ie she'll have to be moved out at some point when her health starts to go). No significant debts. Wife has 1 sibling who makes around 80k and will help us however she can.

My parents: Have only been saving for retirement for 10 years. House is not paid off, not sure how much they have left. Significant debts - my dad is self-employed and has various business debts, I don't know how much. I have one sibling who is currently not in a financial position to help.

I've just been saving as much as possible, but wondering what I should be doing - like an age-targeted fund even though it would only be for a few years? Or CDs? Help please! 

EDIT: we are already saving for our own retirement - maxed out on both employer plans + additional/separate Roth IRAs. We do not and will not have children. 160 is where we are right now, but my wife in particular is likely to significantly increase her income over the next few years based on her career path.

We are not going to leave our parents to suffer for their bad decisions. Some of their choices were bad, and some of them made it possible for us to have the lives we do today.

I have a bank account under my name and have already started saving a decent amount and just learnt about the 50-30-20 rule. The rule states: 50% goes to needs (i.e. rent, gas, groceries, etc.), 30% goes to wants, and 20% to savings. However, benifit of still being a teen is that your needs are covered by your parents (though I'm not taking that for granted); I'm not sure what to do with the 50% that is supposed to go to my needs in the rule. Do I put that into my savings so that it becomes a 70 (savings)-30 (wants)? Should I increase the both the percentages of my savings and wants (i.e. 55% wants, 45% needs; 40% wants, 60% savings; and vice versa). If I can remove needs currently, where do I fit it in my sectors of wants and savings?

  
Another question i'm having (a little irrelevant) is if I, in my time as a teen, would need a seperate division in my savings for emergency funds. Examples of me using my emergency funds would be as simple as maybe my phone broke one day and I had to get a new one or just any emergency that may happen in the case of urgency that I need the money.

personalfinance,50/30/20 rule,50 30 20 rule should be switched?,"I AM NOT A PROFESSIONAL IM JUST A HIGH SCHOOLER PLS BE KIND

tbh i learned only 2 concrete things ab personal finance, compound interest is good, and on average the s&p returns 5% ish a year after inflation.

after researching the compound interest formula with recurring investment, i found this:

(P(1+r/n)\^nt)+(PMT((1+r/n)\^nt)-1)/(r/n)), where P is the principal, r is the rate, n is # times per year compounded, t is the time in years, and PMT is the recurring monthly investment.

my souce is [https://structx.com/annual\_compound\_interest\_with\_contributions.html](https://structx.com/annual_compound_interest_with_contributions.html), but not the picture (it isn't accurate, as it doesn't account for recurring payment). i had to look at the source page and JS scripts to find the formula the site actually used

anyways, using this, and the 5% rule, I came up with this equation:

amount of money saved = 20(12)(monthly income in retirement), as i need 20 times my yearly retirement income, which is just 12 times my monthly retirement income. i want my monthly in retirement to be equal to my monthly in my earning years, so

(%M((1+r/n)\^nt)-1)/(r/n))=240M, where M is my monthly income and % is the percentage of my monthly income i invest each month during earning years

assuming r=0.05, n=12, and t=30, and solving, i get that % should be 0.288, or roughly 30%.

so, if we told people to just switch the 20 and the 30 in the 50 30 20 rule, and save 30% of their income each month, they wouldn't have to see their income drop at all in retirement. i know for a lot of people that can make a difference to quality of life in the income earning years, but maybe it might be worth the extra comfort in retirement.

now, i already hear you saying, ""people don't need to save/spend as much DURING retirement, so it's okay if monthly income drops."" however, it's a hard emotional sell for a lot of people to accept that they will be taking home less money each month during retirement, even if they will be spending/saving less.

At the age of 30 I was able to land a position where I made at least 40k. At age 33 I separated and eventually divorced (she became an alcoholic). During that period, I was able to get rid of all my debt and start saving for the first time in my life. At 37, I now married a financially (and all around amazing woman)  who is willing to work with me to make an amazing life together. It feels amazing to have a partner who works with you, not against you!



EDIT: We have no debt of any sort. 
My employer does offer 401k options. I knew I needed to get started on it but honestly; I delayed getting enrolled out of fear of not knowing what I was doing. I knew since I was getting married I needed to buckle down and get it started. Since I just hit my 1 year anniversary at work I received a letter in the mail detailing their retirement options and my measly balance. Tonight, I plan on doing a a ton of research on the subject.

personalfinance,50/30/20 rule,$2200 a month mortgage on $5500 salary ,"Currently living at home and getting to the age that it’s time to move out (25). I’m currently making 90k a year which comes out to $5500 per month post tax. Was looking at a few options for loans and it’s looking like my total monthly payment including taxes, hoa, insurance, pmi, etc. will be 2000-2200 a month on a $260k home. I’m trying my best to budget responsibly and am trying desperately to follow the 50/20/30 rule, however I don’t think that will work. Following the 3x of income rule I’m hitting the upper limits on what I can afford on the home. However I will unfortunately need to buy a new car as my current cars transmission went out, looking at current car prices and rates il have to spend an additional $400 on the car payment is I decided to finance. Currently my saving are 50k and I’m putting 4K per month into them from my 5500. Of this 50k I have a few options I can do if I chose to pursue the house. I can put minimum down 12k and have a 2200 a month payment out 30k down for 2k… this would require 8 years to break even so I don’t think putting more down makes sense as I’m generating interest on my savings which are kept in sgov. I could buy the car in cash and not pay $400 a month however I’m returning 5.2% on the apy of my money meaning if my APR on the car is less than 6% it would essentially be a wash of interest. I’ve come up with several scenarios but my main concern is if I can infact afford this high of a payment on my income. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

personalfinance,pay off debt,Best way to pay off my credit card debt?,"I am in my late twenties and currently have $14,000 dollars in credit card debt (all on one card with a 19.2% Interest Rate). In February, this debt was at close to $19k and I have been following more of a budget/limiting spending and paying $3-$4k a month to lower this debt. I also recently started a new job and my paycheck after taxes/healthcare are deducted comes out to \~$6k a month. 

I recently came into some inheritance money totaling $19k. This would bring my savings account to \~$22k and I really want to put this money toward my savings and for it to grow, but I also would love to pay off my debt faster. 

With my new salary and inheritance money, does anyone have any recommendations as to how much of this money (if any) I should contribute toward my credit card debt? Or do I just invest/put the inheritance money in my savings and not touch it and continue as I have been with paying off my balance?

personalfinance,pay off debt,If you have credit card debt,"I’m writing this because it took me way too long to deal with my credit card debt. I avoided it because I didn’t know where to start, just making minimum payments.

My $42k credit card debt was stressing me out so much it had a negative effect on my physical health. With a 20%+ interest rate, the minimum payments were over $1k per month and even though I make good money, I wasn’t making any progress paying it down due to my other fixed obligations (mortgage, home insurance, HOA fees, car payment, car insurance, etc). 

Eventually I started watching YouTube videos and reading articles to try and find a path forward so I could actually sleep at night. I’m not a financial professional and I have no motivation to post this other than to try to help other people who are crushed under credit card debt. 

1- transfer balance credit cards - these are great, especially if your credit debt isn’t too high. Shop for one or more that offer a long (12-24 months) period with zero interest. I got two of these and transferred $20k and have just 4 months left until it’s paid off, no interest. 

2- personal loan - the key here is to shop for the best rate and terms. They don’t do a hard inquiry on your credit until you accept the loan. I got a personal loan for the remaining $22k at a fixed 9% interest rate (way better than a 20%+ interest rate) with a 3 year timeline to pay off. This way I’m actually paying off the credit card with a monthly installment I can afford instead of just making minimum payments forever. 

This may seem like basic/“duh” information, but it took me a long time to figure out due to my own fear. I also have tons of friends with significant debt who avoid dealing with it, and when I told them about these methods they were shocked that these options exist. I hope this can help even one person who has credit card debt get out from under it. 

If you’ve had significant credit card debt, what methods did you use to get out from under it?",213,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1ksbep0/if_you_have_credit_card_debt/,1747867399.0,dnmcdonn,1ksbep0,advice_seeking
personalfinance,pay off debt,Any point in paying off a 83 year old's debt?,"So my 83 year old great aunt has recently contacted the family distraught because she has dug herself into a hole of no return. She has 79k of credit card debt ranging from 20-30% interest as well as a timeshare that she stopped paying a few years ago that now shows as 23k delinquent debt on her credit score.

She owns her house outright but turns out shes a hoarder so its is totally trashed and full of black mold, so we might get 50k for it from a flipper if we are lucky. And even then she would need place to live.

She does get around 6k a month from a combination of her pension and social security, so theoretically if she was debtless she would be doing fine.

My moms idea was too get a big loan against home equity but she got turned down for a sight unseen HELOC loan (probably because of her delinquent timeshare payments) and also to borrow against a life insurance policy she had but that only yielded 44k which we think she will need to find a new place.

The family is trying to think of all these creative ways to pay down her credit cards including her deeding the house into someone with good credit's name in order to get the HELOC and then pay off her debt and fix up the house a well as use her pension to pay off the heloc at 8% instead of the CC at 25% average.

But the thought I had today is why? Why pay the debt at all? At 83 years old shouldn't she be able to either declare bankruptcy or ignore the debt until she dies? Its not like she needs credit for the rest of her life.

If she stops paying on everything, she makes more than enough to live comfortably, she just wont be able to get any new credit cards. If she deeded the house to someone else they could get the heloc loan to actually fix the house and she could pay it off with her monthly income to keep living there, because she really doesnt want to move. If she REALLY needed credit, then someone in the family could take care of her.

Am I missing something here? What would be the point of trying to wrangle that amount of debt at that age? Isnt the play to just ignore it? Paying it off for someone who will realistically die in the next ten years (her heath is terrible and she won't go to the doctor) seems like a big waste of resources. But I don't want to tell her to just default if theres something I am missing other than she should give the house to one of us first.",725,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1ib2k8p/any_point_in_paying_off_a_83_year_olds_debt/,1737962862.0,OuchLOLcom,1ib2k8p,advice_seeking
personalfinance,pay off debt,Will paying off my 4k in CC debt all at once be bad or should I do it in chunks?,"I have just under $4kin debt spread across four different credit cards. I've been ignoring it and only making minimum payments for too long. Recently, I came into an $18k inheritance and plan to set aside $10k for a house fund, as I intend to buy in the near future. The remaining $8k will go toward paying off my credit cards and establishing a small emergency fund.

I understand that paying off the entire debt and closing the cards could hurt my credit score. If I open a new card for recurring bills and recurring payments like subscriptions, would that help offset the hit? Or would it be more beneficial to pay the cards off gradually, in medium increments like $500 a month, focusing on one card at a time until they’re all paid off?

\--EDIT--

So my general incentive here is to 0 out debt and save the 170ish dollars in minimum payments towards savings. the goal is not to raise the credit score but hurt it as little as possible.

we have 10k of our own savings and a 10k from the in-laws that is very generously in a high interest savings waiting for us.

I only think to close the cards because, I don't physically have 2 of them they expired and got tossed.

1: two of the cards are from chase and expired, coming from covid times.

2: the other two are from kays jewelers for rings and the other one is a best buy card for electronics. so not important cards.

personalfinance,pay off debt,Accumulated about $10k of credit card debt during a two-year depressive period with multiple manic episodes. Trying desperately to pay it off.,"I have bipolar disorder and have gone through an extreme depressive period with a couple of manic episodes. I’ve finally gotten my medication sorted out (I hope) and am in a much more stable mental state. I’m really embarrassed but I’ve accumulated $10k of debt during this time spending money on trips and unneeded purchases. Just excessive spending all around. 


I have $6k on one card, and $3k on another. I have good credit (thank god) and am thinking i should get a small personal loan and aggressively pay it off.


Again, very embarrassing, but I make good money and I should feasibly be able to pay off the cards fast, but i think my living expenses are making that harder for me. I have $6k in my Employee Stock Purchase Plan, should I cash that out and pay off my cards?


Monthly expenses are:
$4800 in (after taxes)
$700 to savings
$270 to 401k
$1960 to rent
$450 to car payment
$200 to car insurance
$80 to internet/cable
$120 to phone
$300 to minimum payments to cards
$75ish to streaming services


Sometimes I feel like I’m dipping into my savings more than I’d like. I only have $1,500 in savings right now. I’m so embarrassed that I’d rather ask for help anonymously on the internet than talk to my friends and family about this.

Edit: better formatting for bills and credit cards

Edit 2:  thank y’all for the advice so far in such a short time!  Having outside opinions really helps think through this.  So far I think I will be avoiding a loan, it seems that the loan wouldn’t be necessary as it has been made aware to me that this isn’t an absurd amount of debt to have to pay off.  The plan I am most likely to take is:

Paying cc2 first.  With my current account balance and expected spendings per month I should be able to have this card paid off on July 20th ($1000 on June 20th, and the rest in July). After that the remaining off what I would’ve paid with $1000 in July would go to cc1 and it would repeat for each card.  The next card would be cc1 which following the same order would be paid off in September, leaving cc3 as the longest haul being from October to December.

In the meantime I’m definitely going to look into my insurance to help lower the payment.  And maybe after all of this I can rebuild and get a better rate on my current loan for the truck to help reduce it even more.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1l0y6z2/512842_in_credit_card_debt_at_23_yo_and_im_not/,1748807705.0,RelationshipBudget70,1l0y6z2,advice_seeking

personalfinance,credit card debt,"My former sorority is telling me I owe thousands in debt, and has destroyed my credit score. I have no idea what to do.","Not sure if this falls under credit or debt. Really not sure what to do here at all.

For reference, I am 23, I graduated college a few months ago. My freshman year, I joined a sorority. Had a horrible time, but was living in the house, so couldn’t resign until the end of my sophomore year. But I paid all of my dues and rent during that period of time. I submitted the paperwork and severed all ties.

It’s been a few years since then. I recently received a letter saying I owe about $3,000 in unpaid dues to my sorority—or more specifically, to a debt collector. And despite my dues having been tied to my mom’s bank account, this debt has showed up on *my* account, and tanked my credit. I guess I’m grateful that *she* doesn’t have to deal with this, but I have no idea what to do. I can’t get approved for a credit card, I can’t get approved for an apartment without a guarantor. 

I brought it up to my mom, who is insistent that we don’t pay this, because we don’t owe it. And having seen a couple similar posts, it does look like sometimes they might just hit you with more charges after you pay the first one. I’ve also been told that debt collectors will fold relatively easily. But I have no idea what to do, and neither does she.

It seems like the bureaucracy element of this is gone, because 1) this collector bought my debt, so I’m negotiating with them, not the sorority itself, and 2) my sorority's chapter actually shut down last year. Do I talk to nationals? Do I get a lawyer? What kind? How do I restore my credit?

extra note re: paperwork: I'm worried they're going to say that I didn't submit all of the necessary paperwork. But when I tried to log into the account where it would be held, it basically said my account didn't exist... I imagine because I dropped years ago. (Or because they got shut down.) But I don't know how to provide proof, or if I'd even need to.

Worst case scenario, either because I can't prove otherwise or because I truly overlooked something, what if I did overlook one piece of paperwork? I had no involvement with them for several years.

I won’t go too in to detail, but we were living with family and due to life changes had to suddenly move into a rental.

She’s always had a ton of debt due to raising me and my sister as a single mother during the recession. I thought she was making progress on this, but then she told me since her credit score was so bad she wouldn’t get approved for any of the places we were trying to rent, so she needed me to co-sign so we could get into a place quick. I was 23 and knew pretty much nothing about this stuff, and she told me it was only temporary and would be removed from my account later.  I believe when moving into the new place my credit score was in the 700s.

It’s now a year and a half later and I’m trying to move out and educate myself more about this stuff. I needed a credit report for one of the places I’m looking into, and upon looking it over I see my score has dropped down to 560, and there’s 22,000 dollars of debt on my card in my name. I was obviously very upset and asked her what this was about, she told me she was working on getting it removed and that it will go away after a couple months because she is refinancing it into a debt consolidation loan, but from what I’m reading this will be following me for another 7 years. On the report too it’s saying I’ve been getting hit with over due payments since August, up to 150 days in December, and then getting hit with a “charge off” every month since February.

I’m beyond confused on what to do, and honestly don’t understand all of this. I know I should have been more careful, but now that I’m in this situation I’m not sure how to proceed. I feel I’m just starting out and already have a massive stain on my credit report. She says not to worry about it, but I know she’s very bad with this stuff so I feel I can’t trust her. Is it true this will be removed from my record? Or am I just stuck with this stain on my account? 

How can I get out of this situation? Or at least any advice on how to improve it would be very helpful.

I haven’t signed to accept the loan yet and wanted to hear what you guys recommend. I do have quite a bit of equity in my mortgage but was told that a HELOC is unwise as it’s a secured loan on my home. Any advice?

personalfinance,drowning in debt,I’m 23 and drowning in over $75k in debt,"
I don’t know what to do anymore. I work 2 jobs. One job is $20 an hour and about 30 hours a week. The other job is $20.85 an hour for 23 hours a week graveyard. I do DoorDash when I have any spare time. I work everyday and don’t have any days off. I’m back living at home. I don’t have to pay rent since I don’t have a room. I was without a job for 6 months and now I have this schedule. My current bills are $100 for phone, $250 insurance, $275 storage unit (my stuff is in another state I can’t get rid of the storage unit), $450 for my car. All my cards are closed and in collections. My mom wants me to file for bankruptcy to get rid of the stuff that can be gone and pay the stuff that can’t. My credit went from 750 to 450. Should I just spend the next 4 years paying everything down or do bankruptcy to clear most of it?

Relevant personal details about him: 
* 24M full-time graduate student with 1 part-time job
* Recently and unexpectedly had to start paying his own tuition
* Used his credit card to pay off said tuition, putting him thousands in CC debt and inflating his minimum payment (ouch)
* His family is unwilling/unable to help (more than they are already with food)
* He drives a 2023 Hyundai Elantra

Current after-tax income: ~$1400/mo

* Food: $0 (student pantry + family aid)
* Car loan payments: $500
* Car insurance (accident in history): $300
* CC minimum payment: $400
* Rent (lives with roommate): $800

Debt:
* CC Debt: $12k across 2 cards
* Student Loan debt: $30k (soon to be $35k…)
* Remaining car loan debt: $18k

“Emergency fund”: $500

In no particular order, here are my observations:
* The vehicle is too expensive. Downsize to a mechanically sound $5-10k vehicle
* Get another part-time job to supplement income until graduation
* Speak to CC company about hardship accommodations
* Try combining car insurance with family if possible (but ask insurance company to bill separately)
* Consider a debt management plan
* Contribute extra earnings to emergency fund; avoid paying extra on any debt until emergency fund increases to ~$1500
* Do NOT use a CC for any more tuition

I know, stupid stupid stupid. I was young and ignorant to what could happen to my life if I faulted on my payments. 

Here’s where i’m stuck, my debt is in collections and while i’m working on paying them off slowly I can’t get the debt collectors to negotiate the total cost down to be paid in full, but a few hundred dollars. 

I live with family and while they’re okay with me living with them and paying rent I no longer want to be doing this and would love to move out on my own     

I can’t be approved for a debt consolidation loan and paying everything off is taking longer than i’d like. 

Thoughts on filling bankruptcy? Any advice is welcome.

personalfinance,drowning in debt,I am drowning in cc debt please help me ,"Hi all, I am so embarrassed with my tail between my legs asking for help. I know I got myself into this situation, but I don’t have anyone to ask for guidance, and I’m really struggling and overwhelmed with how to tackle paying off this debt. 

Backstory : I am 24F, and I moved to Quebec last year, which was a terrible decision. I moved there not knowing French, and could not find a job for a long period of time - which resulted in living off of my credit cards. In addition to that, I have borderline personality disorder, and one of my horrible self destructive and impulsive actions is a shopping addiction. I am in therapy and on meds now, and the shopping addiction has completely stopped. 

Currently : I moved back home to get a job, and I currently work at Starbucks and Walmart, Starbucks full time and Walmart part time. On my chase card I have almost 23,000 dollars and on my Wells Fargo card I have almost 7,000 dollars. I have not spent on these cards in almost five months, but I just can’t seem to get them down. Everytime I pay the minimum payment, the interest just cancels it out. As you would expect, I don’t have a great credit score right now, it’s about 670. I just do not know what to do, or where to go. I pay the payment but it just gets canceled out and I feel like I am drowning. There are not any debt counselors in my area, so I am truly sol on that front. I know this is my fault, and I know I am the only one who can fix it, but does anyone have any advice on what I should do or where to go with this? I just need help making a plan of action 😭😭

Extra Info: I get paid 15.75 at Starbs, and I work 30hrs a week. I get paid 16 at Walmart and I work 20hrs a week.

I have so much debt and I don't know where to start. I'm trying to figure out what is the most pressing thing to pay off and start there.

I have a master's degree and soo much student loan debt, most of it is federal, though I have two private loans as well. It all adds up to over 100k. I am also an independent contractor and I have not been making enough the last few years to pay all my taxes on time. So I owe about $14k right now.

I track my expenses and I am really not a big spender at all. I am barely making enough to get by, all I spend money on is rent, utilities, my car payment/insurance, medical bills, some loan payments, a couple subscriptions, and food. Sometimes clothes but not often.

Any advice? What do I focus on? Also maybe just some encouragement that one day I will be out of this hole? D; I am really trying. I have 3 jobs right now, one of them is a w2 so I don't need to be saving as much with taxes.

personalfinance,drowning in debt,"Disabled Senior Drowning in Debt, Which Path to Take?","I tried to make this short and to the point, but I don't think I did a good job of it. Thank you to anyone who can bear with me here!

I'm 60 years old and my only income is social security disability $1,755 a month. I live in subsidized senior housing and my rent is $764 monthly with all utilities paid except my internet.  I don't have car payments or other payments except my Medicare supplement (more on that later), costs for food and gas. 

Last year I was completely debt-free and had paid off my debt over the past 4 years.  I was living in Washington state with my adult son for about 5 months and paying $700 monthly for my portion of the rent and utilities, but still had my expensive Medicare supplement, food, etc to pay monthly, so wasn't able to save money to speak of in the end as I was really running it close.

My son helped me with a lot of things on a daily basis. But, I started falling down the stairs and the only option I had was to try to find other housing. I was already on severl waiting lists for senior and disabled housing, which can be anywhere from 3-10 years there. 

The only option I had was to move back to Wyoming where the cost of living is lower and there are senior subsidized housing with short wait lists. So I moved to Wyoming in November 2024 to the senior housing mentioned above, but had to stay in motels until my apartment came available for move in.

The problems started when I had to finance the move to Wyoming and secure the apartment. The move, including truck, movers, the deposit, motels to get there and to stay in until my apartment opened, gas and meals, deposit and rent, took me to $7,000 on my credit cards. There was about 6 weeks worth of motels I had to pay for while I waited for my apartment and that really made the debt sky-rocket quickly.

Fast-forward to now, 5 months later. My $300 monthly Medicare supplement went up to $400 monthly.  The specialists I see are in Denver, so my gas costs are about $300 a month as I have to see them monthly. That leaves me with about $200 for food and essentials.

I can't drop my Medicare supplement as I got it before age 65 and by a miracle didn't need health underwriting. That supplement saves me money as I haven't had a medical bill since I've had it - it pays for all copays, scans, hospital stays, inpatient skilled nursing, surgeries and procedures. It allows me to see doctors who are skilled and to see my cancer doctors at Mayo. Getting rid of the supplement would take away my ability to get excellent medical care and leave me further in debt. 

I am $9,000 in credit card debt. I am out of money by the second week of the month. I have $32,000 in credit, but 9K of that is now used. I have one card that is 0% for another year and that I transferred some balances to. 

I don't know if I should claim bankruptcy? My car is old and I will be needing a vehicle. How in the world can I finance a car and make a payment when I can't even manage as it is without using credit cards for food? 

I am contemplating dropping my Medicare supplement (Advantage Plans are the devil - I had one for a few years and I spent $6K my first year for care not covered and copays, not to mention all the doctors that won't touch someone with and Advantage Plan, including Mayo now).  So, what if I just keep my original Medicare and save myself $400 each month....I can apply for financial assistance at all the large hospitals I go to in order to cover the copays that my supplent would normally cover. That is until our medical system completely crashes and those medical assistance programs die. Even then, any medical debt wouldn't be reportable to the credit bureaus with the new law, is that right?

  
If any of you young, smart people have any ideas, I welcome them all and will consider them. I don't know where to turn and need to make a decision before things get even worse. I'm not alone. So many seniors are in my situation and it's very frightening.

Need recommendations on where to go for financial planning / budgeting. ,"Trying to make a long story shorter, but it's important you see the big picture.  46 years old, married to a retired Navy guy with 3 kids, oldest finishing up first year of college. I have ALWAYS been poor with budgeting and have terrible spending habits starting from when I opened my first credit card at 18. In my 20 years of marriage, we have always kept our finances separate as I have always had my own career / paycheck. Because of this, he wasn't really aware of how crappy my spending / debt was. These bad habits went into warp speed starting in 2021 with the combination of depression (I uncovered his year long affair) and my new high paying job. I was basically self destructive with credit cards, gambling, frivolous spending and now I am DROWNING. I made (just my income) $244,000 in 2024 and I feel broke. I ended up doing credit counseling where they negotiated my interest rates down and closed the cards so I make a $770 monthly payment on that for 5 years. All credit cards are closed which is a step in the right direction. I have personal loans I have taken out totaling about $3000 a month in addition to student loans I cannot afford to pay monthly yet. With debt and regular monthly expenses, I am shelling out $7000 a month, minimum. This is basically my entire base paycheck. My commissions are paid quarterly where I get murdered on taxes and still owe the feds at the end of the year. Getting paid once a month, and commissions paid quarterly is not good for someone that is terrible with budgeting.

Today I found the Gordon Ramsey snowball plan. When I put our debts in there it has us out of debt 8 months sooner than the debt mgmt plan. Clearly, we are going to go the snowball route.

My point in saying all this is that I know could ride out the remaining loans (barring getting fired or something) and theoretically I should have a better gain from my investments. But there's also that corner of my mind that wants to just be rid of the debt.

Auto Loan 1 is for my partner's car and the vehicle is 4 years old. Logic behind paying it off -

>Highest interest rate across all accounts

>Don't want to ride out the full 60 month term in case we start running into mechanical issues with the car and need to pivot to another option. Current $75/mo additional payment should cut 1.3 years off of the loan term

Last Friday was the worst day of my life so far. 

Ive been working very hard 12 hour shifts for the past 5 months and managed to save up 2.9k. That money was meant to be used for me to move out. I live with my parents and i am still studying. I don’t have any big expenses or any debt. 

Before this i would occasionally occasionally  go out to the casino with my friends maybe once every two months. I never made big bets, never had any problems with gambling. And whenever i did play it was always money that i could afford to lose. But long story short i decided to deposit 50$ last Friday into some slots, which snowballed into a 2000$ loss because i kept naively chasing my losses.And i feel absolutely wrecked right now. I am left with 900$ in my bank account.

2000$ is a really large amount for me but in the moment that money felt like nothing. I never done anything like this before. I can’t believe what i did. I can’t believe it was me who did it. No one in my family would ever expect me to do something like that. I am really ashamed of what i did. What makes it sting even worse is that a day prior my mom told me how she is proud of me and how i am so good with my money and now it feels like a spit in her face.

Ever since it happened it is hard for me to eat, sleep, and i am absolutely terrified. I am not sure if i should even tell anyone. My mom wouldn’t even believe me if i told her because i was always good with money.

Last year I was able to pay off my student loans and car completely (cheap 2011 ford escape). I have about 87k in my 401k and am 29. My base salary is 113k. 

My only expenses are rent and utilities. 

I basically would like an adult to help me with what do to do with the money in my savings given the insane volatility in the market right now. I have a moral objection to crypto and am extremely risk averse with regular stocks (hence only the 401k)

personalfinance,student loan help,"Should I sell my S&P 500 holdings to pay off student loans faster, or keep them invested?","Hi everyone, I’m looking for some advice on a financial crossroads I’m facing.

I recently graduated college and just landed my first full-time job in IT, making a bit over $50K/year. I also have student loan debt that totals just over $50K. I’ve been investing a little over the past few years and currently have about $5.6K in an S&P 500 index fund. The account has grown roughly 50% over four years — I initially invested around $3.7K and have made about $1.9K in gains.

Now that I’m in a better financial position, I’m trying to decide whether it makes more sense to:

Sell my S&P 500 holdings and use that $5.6K to pay down my student loans, or
Leave the investment alone and focus on making monthly loan payments while letting the market (hopefully) continue to grow my money.
A few more details that might help:

- I don’t have any other major debts or expenses yet (just paid off my car) and I use my credit card like a debit card.

- I’m not maxing out my 401(k) yet, but I am contributing enough to get the match (5% to get 7% match).

- My student loans are currently at interest rates between 3.7% and 6.5%. In combos, loan 1 & 2 are both the same rate at 3.7% and they increase in these “combos” to loan 7 being 6.5%. 

- The “combos” of loans have a high amount loan and a loan amount loan (around 2k)

My gut tells me that leaving the investment could pay off more in the long term, but the idea of reducing my debt quicker is very tempting — especially now that payments are resuming as of 11/10/2025. 

Out of the 7 loans I have, 3 are currently accruing interest (all around 2k each) and the other 4 don’t start accruing interest until 11/10/2025.


I’d love to hear from anyone who’s been in a similar position or just has a good perspective on weighing debt payoff vs. market growth. Thanks in advance!

personalfinance,student loan help,Spouse has student loans in default. How do I protect myself?,"So I was able to work and get scholarships through college and thankfully didn’t have to take out student loans. My husband, on the other hand, borrowed the maximum amounts possible. I don’t fault him being that he was only 18 and had no help or guidance from his family. It was definitely a poor decision, as he went into an unstable creative field that was already suffering by the time he entered the workforce. 

He has never managed finances well, partially due to mental health issues that were discovered later. I didn’t realize the depth of everything until after we were married. I tried to help him with repayment plans and organize the debt, but after a while, I trusted him to keep up with it.

With the announcement about student loans going back into collections, I discovered that he is in default, despite what he had told me earlier. Now I’m afraid of garnishment since we desperately need his pay, and of course I want to figure out getting out of default. But I’m also concerned about how this will personally impact me and my credit/finances. I know this could lead to the garnishment of our joint tax return. I would appreciate any advice. I’m almost wondering whether I should maybe get a legal divorce at this point to separate our finances further.

personalfinance,student loan help,DEBATE: Between my dad and I on paying off student loans,"I (25) still live at home with the folks. They have been so generous to let me stay while I pay off loans and get myself established. I am unsure on when exactly I will move out, but for context of this post, let's just assume I'll be out by the summer of 2026.

I have about 12k in debt total as of May 2025. 10k in student loans, and 2k on a car. The student loans range from 4.25-5% and the car is 7.5%.

Here's the debate:

\-I would like to hammer down the debt as quick as possible. I've been taking on extra hours at my job, doing some lawn work for neighbors, etc so I can pay this off quickly. If I continue this method, I can have *everything* paid off by August or September. I am currently saving about 400 a month into a money market account, and investing 150-200 into a Roth IRA. Depending on the month, I've been contributing anywhere from 1600 to 3600 towards the debt.

I would like to hammer this debt ASAP. That way, I can begin saving a lot more money for the next year instead of paying more interest.

\-My dad, however, thinks that I should be prioritizing saving money, at least much more than I am now. From his point of view, even if I'm paying, say, 500 total towards my loans, that I'm still way ahead of many people, and building up a good savings / Roth. He also stated that my student loan interest is pretty low, meaning that I'm not accumulating a lot of interest compared to a credit card.

So I seem to be a little stuck here. Obviously my dad cares about my future, and I trust a lot of his judgements. He's been pretty good about money and he's made a lot of smart choices with it. But I've still been pretty firm on my stance. What do you guys think?

personalfinance,student loan help,"55, no savings, no retirement, no home ownership. Terrified. ","I’m 55, no savings, no retirement, no home ownership.

I’ll try to be brief in telling you how I got to this point, but bottom line is I made a poor life choice.

10 years ago, I was married, a stay-at-home wife and mom for 15 years, when my husband “abruptly” walked out. (It turns out, an old girlfriend had tracked him down on Facebook and they’d been plotting his “departure” for several months.) I was shocked to learn he had secretly stopped paying the mortgage, knowingly leaving me and our children in a foreclosed home. He’d also depleted all of our savings. I received nothing in the divorce, as there were no assets left. An additional wrinkle was my diagnosis with a debilitating, chronic illness. 

The past decade has been rough. My education and work before marriage had been in interior design. I was unable to find a job in that field post divorce. I returned to college, cramming through an accelerated bachelor’s program in healthcare administration. I used student loan money to help keep a rented roof over our heads. Upon graduation, I found a no-benefits, $10 per hour job in a doctor’s office. It took nearly every bit of my take home pay to cover rent. 

Fast forward, I’m now making $20 per hour, as a contract worker. The contract house offers a self-funded health “insurance” plan and a ZERO-percent matching 401k. There are no raises, ever, and no chance to become a direct hire. My take home pay is a meager $2500 per month. I have tried and tried to find a better job, to no avail. At one point, I managed to find a second job, but after 5 months, the 16-hour work days caught up with me and my health. 

I have no idea how to get out of this mess. I am terrified about my financial future and worry about how many more years I’ll be able to work given my poor health. I would like to own a home again, not a large house like I used to have, but a small condo in a safe area, and I know I need a retirement savings, but I don’t know if it’s even feasible. Where do I start?

personalfinance,student loan help,Pay off student loans or invest?,"My husband and I are in our late thirties and we still carry student loans. We have 35k in loans with interest rates ranging from 4.2% to 7.75%. the majority are at about 6.5%.

We have become higher earners over the past few years (~300k combined annually) but haven't really changed our financial mindset - we both grew up in paycheck-to-paycheck families and we didn't honestly understand the magic of compounding interest until ...well, now. We've moved a lot, bought and sold multiple homes, and have generally not made good financial decisions. We are really just now starting to try to improve our financial health. 

We currently have 80k in the bank just sitting in cash. This is our emergency fund but it is larger than it needs to be - we are both in relatively stable jobs. We're trying to decide whether to take half the emergency fund and fully pay off the loans or invest that money in an index fund. 

To give you a picture of our current financial health: We also have about 470k in our 401ks and we max out our 401k contributions each year. I also have around 10k in an HSA. I understand we should also be investing in an IRA, but we've been kind of lazy and just used the employer sponsored 401ks so far. We also have saved about 20k in 529 plans for our daughters (ages 6 and 4) and a few thousand dollars in low cost index funds in the stock market.

We have no credit card debt or no car payment, but we pay a mortgage of 5k a month, 1500 a month in student loans, 1400 a month for my daughter's preschool, and 1000 a month to help my mom with rent (~9k of fixed expenses every month plus bills, food, and flexible spending). We aren't struggling to handle these payments but we want to make better choices going forward than we have so far. 

There's something attractive about getting out of the student loan debt, but there's also something attractive about making a larger investment in the market and starting our investment journey. With the market being so volatile, though, I think that's probably a bad idea? 

We considered talking to a financial planner because we know we could be saving more and generally being smarter with our money, but they all seem pretty expensive and I'm not sure it is really worth it.

I’ve been trying to read up and plan ahead, but it’s a lot to take in.

I’m already thinking long-term about how I’ll manage the repayment. One thing I’ve noted is living like you’re broke even after graduating and to use every available dollar to pay down your loans, and always try to pay more than the minimum when you can.

Another thing is to pick up a second job, even if it’s just something seasonal like during the fall or winter. Some people use that time to make extra payments without burning out the rest of the year.

I’m hoping to get ahead of this before I’m too deep in. If you’ve been through this process, what do you wish you knew when you were starting college? Any resources or strategies you’d recommend?

personalfinance,student loan help,Should I use a student credit card or loan to buy a laptop? Low-income student with an urgent need for a powerful laptop (school + major project),"Hi everyone,

I’m a low-income college student (pretty much at/below the poverty line), and I urgently need a new laptop. My current one is barely functioning, and I need something reliable before the semester starts next month. But this isn’t just about classes, I also need a laptop powerful enough for a major long-term project I’m working on.

I’m working on something big that involves video work and heavy multitasking. I need a high-performance laptop, possibly something like a gaming or professional workstation laptop, because this project could seriously shape my future (and potentially bring in income down the line).

My mom suggested I open a student credit card and use that to buy the laptop. She said she would help by paying off a portion of the balance each month. But the credit card would be in my name, and I don’t currently have a credit history. I’m nervous about making a decision that could damage my credit long-term, especially since I have limited income and no real savings.

So I’m wondering if  I should I go the credit card route and build credit while paying it off (with help)?

Should I try to take out a small personal or student loan?

Or are there any other options I’m not thinking of?


To summarize:

I’m very low income.

I don’t have a credit card or any credit history yet.

The laptop is a need, not a luxury, it's for school and a major project.

I want it to last through undergrad.

I want to be smart and protect my credit long-term.


Any advice, suggestions, or maybe even personal stories would really be appreciated.

personalfinance,ready to buy a house,Are we financially ready—and is it smart—to buy a second house? (25 & 23),"Hi all, I’m (M25) a long-time lurker here. My wife (F23) and I are thinking about buying a second home that just hit the market. It’s in the same neighborhood as our current house, but this new place has a better layout and lot. The plan would be to move into the new house and keep our current one as a rental.

We feel like we’re in a strong position for our age, but since we’re still early in our financial journey, I wanted to get outside opinions before making such a big move.

# Financial Snapshot

* Combined income: $220K/year (\~$12.5K/month take-home)
* Net worth: \~$165K
* Savings: $13K
* Retirement accounts: \~$80K (Roth IRAs, Roth 401k, Traditional IRA)
* Home equity: \~$30–40K (current home: $220K owed @ 4%, $1600 monthly payment, worth \~$260K)
* Cars: Both paid off, worth \~$40K total
* No other debt

We just finished aggressively paying off my wife’s car loan, $23k in 3 months, so right now our only liability is our mortgage. Our spending averages about $4,000/month, which includes the mortgage, and with no car payments anymore, we’re in a good spot to save heavily going forward.

The house we’re looking at is listed for around $270–280K. We’d plan to put 10% down, and I’d get about $8K in commission credit since I’m a licensed realtor. Mortgage would come out to around $2,000–2,300/month. We’d rent out our current house, and I’m confident it would at least break even or cash flow $200/month. It’s in great shape, relatively new, and won’t need major repairs anytime soon.

This is where my hesitation comes in: to fund the down payment, we’d most likely use $20K from our Roth IRAs, mostly contributions, some converted funds (we’re aware of the potential small penalty). The idea is to take $10k from my and my wife's IRAs. We’d still keep $13K in cash savings after closing, and since our monthly expenses are relatively low, we should be able to rebuild quickly.

This feels like a smart move: better primary home, retain our 4% mortgage as a rental, solid cash flow, and no lifestyle inflation. But we’re young, and I want to make sure we’re not skipping steps or getting ahead of ourselves.

Would love to hear what you think, good move or too much too soon?

personalfinance,ready to buy a house,Am I ready to buy a house?,"Trying to get some sanity check on my logic.

I got about 220k available I could use for a down payment on a house. Household income without my wife’s new job is 400k. Potentially 550k with it. We got about 60k in an emergency fund. Retirement accounts are getting maxed out every year. 1k in monthly debts from a car loan with super low interest rates (1.99%).

Considering the funds earmarked for a down payment of 20%, we could afford up to 1.1M in housing. At 6.8% mortgage rate over 30 years fixed that would result in about 7.4k mortgage payment a month. We currently pay only 2.5k in rent so this feels like a big change.

Am I being too conservative here? I saw much higher budgets in online “how much house can I afford” calculators. 

If I play through this with a larger number, say 1.5M, we’d have to pay PMI as we won’t reach 20% down, 220k would only be enough for 15%. This would leave us at about 11k a month including 500 a month in PMI for 5 years. 

Alternatively, we could wait until we have enough for 20% down on 1.5M, but who knows, the house that’s 1.1M know may actually cost 1.5M by then and we didn’t gain anything aside of not having built equity.

1.5M feels aggressive as I am so used to the low rent we are paying, am I being too conservative here with how much we can comfortably afford?

personalfinance,ready to buy a house,My (37) Parents came clean about financial disaster and I don’t know where to start,"I’m looking for directional advice on where to look to start tackling the financial disaster that my parents have created. If anyone has thoughts on avenues to help address this situation and considerations that I need to account for, that would be enormously helpful. I live in IL and my folks live in NJ

History: If you don’t want additional context you can skip to The Situation.

Me: I’m 37 (M) married with a five month old. I’ve been in sales engineering for 12 years and have built myself a decent nest egg. Ever since I saw my parents weather the financial crisis, I’ve realized how important it is to be economically stable. Recently, my parents, who are otherwise wonderful people, came to me asking for help organizing their finances and what I saw horrified me.

Parents: My dad (72) is a self made entrepreneur and my mom (71) was a preschool teacher. I grew up in a loving, upper middle class household. My dad owns a small business in market research for 30 years that was very successful. He managed to make it through the .com bubble and the financial crisis relatively unscathed. While there were scary times, he was always able to pull it out. 

Covid was a different monster. His company hung by a thread, but my dad always knew he was going to make it through. His hubris got the best of him and he started lending the company money to keep it afloat. He put everything into it and I mean everything. I knew it was bad when he asked me for money a couple of years ago. I understood the risks and loaned them the money. He asked again a year later and I gave them a small infusion to hold them over.

They came to visit me after the birth of my daughter five months ago. I could tell that they were distracted when, what should’ve been a happy occasion, felt somber. They told me that they were falling behind on their bills, so I started to ask questions. I knew things were tough at the business, but I didn’t know how bad things were, and frustratingly, neither did they. They told me that their credit card payments were getting too high, which I foolishly thought that they had some big purchases, but when I questioned them further the money was for minimum payments on their credit card. I essentially told them that I would help them out if they gave me the full picture as long as the money goes to them and not interest payments.

The Situation:
Flash forward to last week. They finally come clean with their financials and it was way worse than I thought. My dad borrowed from their entire nest egg to keep his business afloat. Not only did he borrow from his 401K and his IRA’s, but it went so much deeper. He borrowed millions from his and my mom’s retirement. They finally opened up their books up to me and I was shocked

Debts
Credit card debts: adds up to $92K across seven different cards. Some of these cards my dad is the main card holder and some are in my mom’s name. Their total minimum payments come to ~$3,300/month and the interest rates vary from 14% to 33%
Car Debt: They leased a car in my dad’s name from GM Financial with $532 payments and a buyout  price of $38,530 
House Debt: They owe ~$90K on their mortgage and took a HELOC with ~$60K left. 
Bank Account: $300 overdrawn

Monthly Expenses
Variable Expenses: ~$3100/month across groceries, internet, car, etc
Insurance: $2600/month this includes
* Life insurance ($1.5M): $1,200
* Long Term Care: $800
* Medicare Supplement: $300
* Various other policies: $300
Mortgage+Taxes: $3,230/month at a 4.25% rate
* Because all of this happened as a result of COVID, they qualified for a 12 month reprieve on housing expenses. The stipulation is that they don’t sell the house or refinance for three years.

Asset:
House: would say that this is their best asset and could conservatively sell for $600K. They live in a development with three home layouts and one with their layout sold for $850K in the last month. Their unit is much less updated and needs a little work to get it ready.
Social Security: $5,150/month

Cash Flow:
Current total expenses: ~$12,400/month
Total Income: $5,150 + some teaching jobs they’ve picked up
Net: -$7,250

Today: 
There are obviously some emotional and behavioral factors that need to be addressed  in the situation. I’m not looking for feedback on whether or not I should help - I first want to stabilize the situation and set them up for longer term sustainability.

Initially, I was going to pay off their credit cards and buy out the rest of their mortgage then they would transfer the deed to me. This would allow them to live in the house for essentially free (paying taxes and HOI), but as I dug more into the situation, I’m realizing that this is a bit above my pay grade. My sense is to go to a bankruptcy lawyer to help unwind this mess. I’m not sure if there are other avenues that we need to explore.

We were both pretty late to the game when it comes to saving money (for both house and retirement)

The houses we are looking at/really like have been between $275K and $375K and how much we like it is pretty consistent with the pricing. 
(haven’t bothered looking at higher because idk how comfortable I feel with a huge mortgage, but if I can comfortably do it maybe we can up the price range?)

- Checking: $15,000
- Savings (HYSA): $48,000

personalfinance,ready to buy a house,Would it be better to buy a Condo or small house,"I'm stuck and ready for my own place but not ready for my forever home. I currently travel for work, working 6 weeks with the 7th off. I have saved alot of money (80K) hoping to buy my forever home, paying it off, then getting a job where the home is. But in doing so my parents have been kind enough to let me stay rent free at their place to save money, but I absolutely hate staying with them for long periods of time because who does haha.

 So I've been thinking of investing the money into a place to have my own space but don't want to lose to much money in the process and having to worry about taking care of to many things while I'm gone.

My area where my parents live is absolutely booming and prices are sky rocketing (Wilmington NC) and I don't really like living in the area but would be easy to move my belongs to a stepping stone place.

I'm terrified of making a bad decision, I've worked really hard to save the money, but being still single at 32(M) and still wanting to work the job I currently have I'm stuck trying to figure out what's best.

personalfinance,buy vs rent,Its always smarter to rent than buy?,"So the wife and I (both mid 30s) are expecting a child soon and she he has been really pushing to buy a property. I have ran the numbers and we can certainly afford the down-payment and the all in cost of ownership (EMI, maintenance, HOA fees etc.). So affordability isn't an issue and we would not be buying ""too much"" house as per the standard rules of thumb like the 28/36 Rule (Debt to Income ratio) and 3-5x annual income rule. The upfront payment however will represent 50% of our savings.

For context, we live in Dubai and the reason I mention it is because its tax free. No income tax , no property taxes or capital gains taxes either on property value appreciation or on equities.

I have also developed a detailed model on rent vs buy. If certain assumptions I have made (property appreciation, long term mortgage interest rates) etc. hold then its better to buy vs rent. However, I have no way of knowing if those assumptions will hold even if I think they are reasonable at this point.

I just feel there is way too much concentration risk with buying a property. I am placing a huge bet in the Dubai economy or the specific building and apartment that it will increase its value even if my assumptions are modest.

My alternative is to invest my money in a globally diversified stock/bond index fund. It may turn out that the dubai property market continues to boom and I will be kicking myself for missing out on all the sweet sweet gains 10 years from now but just given the concentration risk, I don't think its a smart decision. I may end up making less money by going the index fund route but given the massive diversification and 100+ year history of stock market returns, it just feels like the smarter choice.

And then I wonder, why is my situation so different to any other? Wouldn't it always be better to rent vs busy just given the concentration risk?

I know you will say that there is an emotional angle of owning your own property and the stability that comes with it. But then isn't that emotional perspective logically overblown given that that there is significant downsides to owning property besides just potential sub-optimal returns (significant debt, illiquidity potentially creating a catastrophic situation if you lose your job for lets say 6+ months in a down-turn)

My wife is really keen to buy and I am open to be convinced but I just don't see a good reason. Maybe I am blind?

EDIT: I am slightly surprised by the responses. I know a lot of people are sometimes emotionally invested in the idea that owning a house is great which I can appreciate as I am not immune to the same feelings. However, a lot of people have ignored the crux of my question. Given the disparity in concentration risk in buying vs renting(and investing the downpayment in index funds), why would buying make sense? Yes owning a house and investing can be different but they don't have to be mutually exclusive always.

personalfinance,buy vs rent,Buy vs rent: are we crazy to buy?,"Have been home shopping for 2-3 months now. But I just realized that our total monthly housing payments will be **double** what we will pay in rent. 

* Our rent is **5k**. 
* The mortgage payment for a home that fits our minimal criteria is 1.6-1.8m.  @ 20% down the monthly payment incl mortgage, taxes, HOAs, ins is around **10k**. Even without a mortgage it is around 2k.

Background is that my partner and I are DINKS and make good incomes so we can afford the monthly payments, but job stability is not great(we are both in tech). So I like that for renting if we have a job loss we can rent a less fancy or further out place, or relocate for a new job, though we like our current city so we would like to eventually come back here.

personalfinance,buy vs rent,Close on a condo in a highly desirable area vs. Lose earnest money and rent?,"I jumped the gun and put an offer on a condo in a great area of Atlanta at the pressure of my parents (obviously it was my choice but I did feel influenced and pressured by them) and because it seemed like a good deal. The condo is in a walkable and desirable area. It’s next to restaurants and bars, in the middle of it all but it’s also quiet and has lots of trees and shade. 

The condo is in a two story, historic building. Less than 10 units. It has a remaining economic value of 42 years. Bathroom and kitchen have been remodeled and new roof. Good HOA/reserve. But It is a one bedroom condo that is around 700 square feet. There are 0 amenities in the building (not even parking), no elevator, and I am feeling claustrophobic thinking about being on the second floor. I’m used to apartment living but somehow paying out of the wazoooo for a place I don’t even own the land is making me reconsider. 

I made a mistake by not offering lower than the sale price- because my real estate agent was adamant I don’t. I was told that the seller had gotten an appraisal valuing it higher than listing price and that I need to offer listing price. It was certainly on me to not have pushed back and deep down I *knew* I should have offered less than the asking price. But alas, I put in the offer for the listing price and it was immediately accepted. (I later found out that a unit in the same building sold for 7K less 😭).

I kept getting cold feet and wanted to walk away immediately after putting the offer down. But I was convinced and swayed by my folks that I would be making a mistake and that this is a good opportunity. 

Now as I’m approaching closing date I’m getting cold feet and can’t help but wonder I’m making a mistake.

If I run the numbers, this condo is going to cost me about $2700+ in monthly fees (principal + 6.75% interest, PMI, HOA, insurance and utilities). The monthly interest rate I would be paying for the first year is roughly $1620-$1634 per month and principal is $250-$260 per month. 

I am able to find a rental of 600 square foot loft for $1664 per month. So even based on these numbers my interest would be equal to my base rent. And that’s not counting utilities, PMI, etc.

I know that I should have waited but I jumped the gun and felt pressured by family and the real estate agent to make this happen. 

Now I’m considering walking away from the earnest money deposit (5K) and to rent a one bedroom loft for ~ $1700 a month and buy a SFH a year or two from now. 

I’ve run the numbers every which way and it’s impossible to predict the future…. I know that condos are seen as a bad investment online but IRL I would never be able to afford a house or even a townhome in this area. So a condo offers me an ability to build equity. But on the same time, I’m already thinking how small it is, and how limited I will feel with the space. I want to be able to have a garden or have an extra office room to make into an office or a studio. I did consider all those things when making the initial offer but the appeal of being a “home owner”, living in a beautiful space in a walkable area, and building equity clouded my vision. 

Now I’m facing either closing on this condo or walking away. I’m losing money regardless. I just worry that closing and purchasing this condo is going to make me lose more money than the 5K I stand to lose by walking away (I’d confirm with my agent that there would not be additional fees).

There has also been talk that similar to Austin, Atlanta’s market is going to be flooded by condos and it will drive their value down even more. I feel like the condo I am set to purchase is slightly overpriced and the small space and lack of amenities really concerns me. I know I should have thought about this BEFORE putting in an offer but I’m a first time home buyer and was deep in fantasy land of being a home owner.

I could outright buy this car, but that would virtually wipe out my savings. I could get a car loan with decent terms to protect my savings, but that’s more money in the long run.

I'm 22, and don't have a lot of money saved up yet. My current car has been having serious issues, and is reaching a point of being more expensive to sink money into it than to buy a new one. 

The problem with buying a new car is I can only spare at absolute *most* 4k before any money I can get for my current car (I'm getting the impression I'll be lucky to get 1-2k, but will probably get less). 

I'm hearing so many different opinions and things about financing, leasing, and buying outright, and have no clue where to even begin searching for answers. 

Would it be better to get a used vehicle that may last me a few years for 4k? Or to put 2-4k down on a more expensive, probably more reliable, car and finance it? I have a stable income and no reason to believe that will change, as well as a good credit score. 

I know this probably isn't a black and white question, but if people could point me to helpful resources or give me input on their experiences, that would be great. Thank you :)

personalfinance,buy vs rent,Renting Vs. Buying help me decide,"A little background Me (22M) and my fiancé (22f) (getting married in 1 month) both finish college in December and we are trying to make a decision on whether to rent or buy for the next few years. We both have worked full time through most of high school and college and will have saved 75k. Eventually we plan to have kids around 2030 and would like to buy a larger house then with a lot of land (but that’s not affordable right now). 

Budget - We both already have job offers making 150k-160k (depending on bonuses) between the 2 of us. I’ve created a monthly budget and have allocated $3,100 for housing. In both scenarios I will be putting $1000 a month into an index fund (This is important in the renting argument).

Buying argument - If we were to buy we would put a 50k down payment on a house around 260,000 fix upper at a 6% interest rate for 15 years that would leave us with $1,774 per month payment for a total loan of $319,427. After property tax, home insurance, utilities total monthly estimated cost is around $2440. Which is well below the budget. Over the 3-4 year time frame I would plan on investing around $45,000 into the home. I have the skill to personally do all home improvements decreasing the cost. So after some research  I could expect to resell the home between 315k-325k. Before the purchase of any house I will compare to comps in the area. After 3.5 years my loan would have 184,202 left. Thus after paying this off I would have around 130,000 (going towards next house down payment) bringing my net cost of housing for 3.5 years to -25,000 not including closing costs on buying and selling (so probably closer to $35000).

Renting Argument- We are going to look at the same 3.5 year time frame. After all costs of renting and utilities I am looking between 1500-1700 a month so let’s go with the higher. I would then take the 50k down payment put it into an index. On top of my already 1000 a month I mentioned earlier I will put an extra 1500 a month (the rest of my housing budget & money I would have used for renovations) into this fund. So it would cost me about 71k over the 3.5 years to rent. But over 3.5 I will have invested an additional $110,000 on top of my 1000 I had originally planned a month. After 3.5 years at 8% return I will have about $190,000. I would want to leave $50,000 in the fund leave me with $140,000 to go towards my next home. Bringing my total cost of housing to -35,000.

The numbers are so close that’s why I am struggling to decide. Do I trust the market in such a relatively short time 3.5 years and go easier investment and rent. Or do I trust myself in home repair and slowly fix up a house for the next 3-4 years. Let me know your thoughts or if you disagree with my numbers or just any ideas.

The other house has someone moving in soon, there will be moved in before I could close, and they will only be paying $500 a month also. I know these numbers are laughably small in today's terms, but that's just how it is where I live. 

The houses have newer metal roofs, decent vinyl siding, but are otherwise very basic. I can do 99% of the maintenance myself. 

So is it worth it to buy them both, continue living in this house until I build and rent the other for less than I'll be paying per month, just to build equity? I currently have no debt, not married, no kids. Was planning on breaking ground this year but I could wait if this is the smarter route. 

Any and all advice welcomed. Thanks in advance. 

Edit: will definitely have it inspected by a licensed inspector. Also I could afford to pay for both of them, without a renter. Just wanted to see if it was a smart move financially. Thanks again for all the advice. I may not be able to reply to everyone but I appreciate everyone.

personalfinance,afford a house,"Here is my current financial situation as a 32 year old doctor, how much house can I afford?","I’m a 32 year old hospitalist in Los Angeles. I graduated residency one year ago and have been working ever since. 

My students loans are $324k and we’re on the SAVE plan, who knows what will actually happen with that; but as of right now I have never made a single real payment towards them and was originally planning on PSLF for loan forgiveness 

I make roughly $305k per year, which is going to increase over time year over year as I stay with my medical group longer. I think next year my raise is 5% and then after that I’m not sure. My take home pay is roughly $175k, or $14,500 per month. 

From the above $14,500 per month, I’ve been investing about $8k per month into a stock portfolio that today is at roughly $300k. I’ve got $25k in an emergency savings account and that is approximately all of my savings.

My other expenses currently are $2750 for rent (which obviously I’d stop paying if I bought a home) and then roughly $3000 on everything else (food, expenses, bills, travel, dining etc…)

I have a girlfriend who is debt-free and makes about $160k before taxes, which I estimate will roughly be at $90k after taxes. I hope to eventually make her my fiancé then wife, so we would both be pitching in to this house.

Whatever benefit there is to filing our taxes jointly, I would also assume we would have in this situation.

Obviously Los Angeles is an expensive city to live in, and homes that seem quite average looking can go for a million or more. I’d like to know what the most expensive home we could reasonably afford would be. Let’s assume we are somehow able to get a 6% mortgage rate on a 30-year loan. 

Lastly, please don’t suggest we move, neither of us is interested in doing that.

My saints of parents have offered us a full bridge loan at the lowest minimum IRS rate, which is 4.53% as of this month.  As my salary increases over the years (hopefully) and we can comfortably afford a bank loan at whatever rate, we will refinance at a bank to free up my parents' money.

We would like to keep our monthly PITI below **$2.5k/month** since with little ones we're needing to save for college.

After all the recent inflation (not to my salary lol), houses where we are looking go for **$450k-550k**.

Let's say we purchase a $500k house.

Property taxes here are around 2.3%, so that's about $1,000/month.  That leaves $1,500 for everything else (P+I+I).  At 4.53% on a 30-year mortgage, that means we have to put down at the very least **$250k**, or 50% of the value of the house, to keep our payment below $2.5k/month.  We'd still have at most $110k left over for moving, closing costs, home maintenance, and an emergency fund.

Is this the right approach to take?

On the other hand, we could put $100k down (20%) and that makes PITI $3.2k/month, making saving from paychecks a little harder.  With the additional $150k of savings we'd have however, we could invest it.  Not sure if after taxes we could get >4.53% returns though without taking some risks.

personalfinance,first home,"Former employer forgot to stop paying me, now they want ME to pay back take home and taxes, SS, etc.","Hello!

My former employer forgot to notify HR of my leaving. The next pay period I received a direct deposit from them. I reached out to my former supervisor and let them know. Said it would be taken care of and I'll be notified if they need anything. Two weeks later, didn't hear anything, received another deposit. I then notified my supervisor's supervisor. They apologized and said they'd get a hold of HR.

Almost two weeks later, HR sent me an email and informed me they were just notified of my leaving. My total take home was about $3000, but they are requiring that I pay them back about $4500!  That's my total of both paychecks before SS, taxes, 401k, etc.

They took blame for this, but that's not even remotely fair to have to pay back those taxes and everything!  So I have to be out $1500 because THEY screwed up?  Is that legal??  And of top of it all, those taxes will still be there and count against me at tax time!  Shouldn't then be required to petition the government for those funds back??

This is in Indiana if that makes a difference. Should I get a lawyer for this?  Is there anyone I can talk too??

**EDIT:**

As some of you may have seen below, I posted an update earlier after talking with my tax guy.  Taking his advice,, as well as some of yours, I responded to HR in an email explaining that I was only paying back what I received (and I specifically put the dollar amount and included screenshots of my pay stubs), that they could get the state and federal stuff back through their software, I wanted proof my W2 was fixed, and I wanted confirmation of receipt of email and a specific address on where to send the certified check.  I also reminded them how this was their fault and that I had reached out to them multiple times to get the situation fixed.

I week goes by, no response.  After a week and a day, I responded to the email I sent, asking for verification that it was received, only this time I put that HR persons boss on it as well.  First thing the next morning, I had an email stating they received it, where to send the check for the amount that I dictated, that they would schedule a zoom call with me and accounting to go over my W2 and how they fixed it, and that they were glad WE could come to an agreeable solution to the issue!

I have 100k in stocks I’m selling. Wife has 100k in savings. I have 66k in a Roth IRA and 500k in a 401k.

Wanting to put 200k down, and need about 30k at least for modest remodels and to have a cushion to move and for any unseen circumstances. More like, 50k perhaps. 

I contribute 100 bucks to Roth IRA that I never think about. I intend to stop that payment and liquidate account (taking penalty hit after 10k) and leaving my 401k alone. Any money I could plan to save for retirement in the future will be in the form of increased 401k contributions. I’ve maxed out what my company matches. 

At the moment, we found a bit of a gem for the neighborhood, and are rushing to buy from a terminally ill seller who just lowered it 100k. Dream location and home in the making. Would never plan to sell. Want to lock it down and need to come up with more money than I have on hand to secure it. 

I am not financially talented, but frugal and have made some smart moves. Am I crazy for liquidating Roth IRA that I plan to stop contributing to when I already have a good amount in a 401k? Also have a pension with company and pension provides half my retirement to my spouse(additional amount, not taken from my amount).

personalfinance,down payment savings,Is it wise to use a ROTH IRA simply as a savings account for a house down payment?,"Hi everyone, before you panic, no I do not want to dip into my retirement savings to buy a house. I realize how stupid that would be (I have a 401K that is my main retirement account). I opened a Roth IRA last year and immediately put 7000 in it, from what I’ve read, since you can withdraw your contributions at any time after 5 years (4 for me now) and you can withdraw up to 10K of the earnings tax and penalty free for a first time home purchase, it seems like the perfect account to use as a house savings account. So in my case, let’s say I contribute 7000 a year for the next 4 years, I would then have 35k of contributions plus whatever gains that investment makes in the meantime to withdraw (up to 10k) to buy a house. This seems much better than using my regular taxable brokerage account to save for a house since it doesn’t have the tax benefit of withdrawing for first time home buying. Am I missing something here? Again, I have my retirement squared away, this would not affect that part of my financials. So my question is, is using a Roth IRA purely as a short term savings account to use to buy a house a smart strategy? 

Edit: I think I’ve mostly changed my mind, I’m not giving enough weight to the tax benefits of using a Roth for long term retirement account.

personalfinance,down payment savings,NYC can be cheaper than Orlando Florida,"Lately, I’ve been thinking about moving down south to Orlando or Tampa, Florida.

I pay $850 for my room, plus some utilities, which brings it to around $930 total. I make about $26 an hour—not great for NYC, but it’s better than what I'd earn in Florida for a similar driving job. I work in paratransit, helping people with accessibility needs.

I also save money by shopping at local, often foreign-owned grocery stores that offer lower prices than places like ShopRite. Even produce is cheaper there.

And here's another factor: in NYC, I don’t need to own a car. Subway fare is way cheaper than car payments, insurance, maintenance, and gas—especially with how much people drive in Florida.

My husband and I are going to be moving into my in laws house that they so generously do not want us to pay rent/bills for so that we can get ahead in life. I have been juggling whether or not we should just pay off my loans or save up for a down payment (my financial advisor’s vote) being we live in California and we’ll never be able to save up for a down payment as heavily as we can right now again. Psychologically, I want the loans gone but I also want what’s best for our money. My husband and I make about 135k together pre tax. My student loans with interest rates are attached for reference:

Planning to dump more into Nvidia if it dips, else continue VT and chill. My returns just crossed 10%, leading to $1000 US portfolio value. I just started a job after an MBA last year so I have been investing regularly for a year now. 

I have around $9000 in Indian index funds and gold bonds. I know $10k isn’t much for most people here, but it’s a big amount in India and I’m pumped to finally reach $10k invested. 

Since I’ll most likely be retiring in India, I’m not going to focus more than 10% of my portfolio on international diversification. Can’t wait to reach $100k now. Baby steps. I’ll get there sooner or later as long as I spend less than I earn and invest the rest.

investing,invest $1000,Vanguard silently lowers the expense ratio on 53 ETFs,"**The average expense ratio reduction is 23%.**

The official Vanguard news and announcements URL - [https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/corporatesite/us/en/corp/who-we-are/pressroom/index.html](https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/corporatesite/us/en/corp/who-we-are/pressroom/index.html) \- has made no mention of these changes at the time of writing this post.

Vanguard has reduced the expense ratios (the annual fees you pay) on many of their most popular ETFs. For example, their [Total International Stock ETF (VXUS)](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vxus) now costs just 0.05% per year – down from 0.08%. That’s a 37.5% reduction.

Investors benefit from reduced fees because every dollar saved in fees is a dollar that stays invested and can grow over time. While fees aren’t the only factor to consider when choosing investments, they’re one of the few aspects of investing that you can control. Lower fees mean more of your money stays invested for your future.

You don’t need to take any action to benefit from these lower fees if you already own affected Vanguard ETFs (list below). The reduced expenses will automatically apply to your investments.

Update:

* Added the value of a portfolio that DCA'ed $1000 every month from 1995--2013. That's two big recessions, the first one lasting 3 years. 
* In both cases, the portfolio was negative only year (per recession)!
* IMO what the data says is that if you're looking to retire in the near future, a recession in the near term will postpone those plans by only a year or two. So I may have over reacted ;-)

investing,invest $1000,100k-ish to play with. Burned in ‘01 and ‘08. Gunshy with little to no knowledge,"I got burned twice as a newer and younger investor in the previous crashes mentioned. Essentially have stayed out of the market since.

I’ve got about 90k spread between a Roth and traditional that is sitting in bonds. I’ve also got 100k, give or take, that I could invest when the time is right - to finally get back in after all these years of being gunshy.

I’m not a savvy investor by any stretch. To be honest, I haven’t paid much attention to the market since being burned twice.

If you were a novice looking to potentially use some of this dry powder, what and when would you be focusing on?

Would you look at some of the individual tech companies if the market further drops, or would you look to some of the more popular funds that people rave about?

Would investing $500-$1000/day or every few days be the better approach than dropping bigger chunks at a time?

I’m kind of ashamed for not stepping up my knowledge after all these years. So, I’ll look at any potential responses as part of my education process.

investing,invest $1000,Why is Roth better because of tax free growth?,"I often hear people say that one of the main benefits of Roth vs Traditional retirement accounts is that it grows and compounds tax free. I'm trying to understand what exactly is meant by this benefit because the amount that you end up withdrawing in retirement will always be the same given that the tax bracket remains when you contribute vs withdrawal.

If I invest $100 today in a Traditional account and it grows 10x to $1000, if my marginal tax rate is 25% then I end up with $750

If I invest $100 today in a Roth,  I pay the 25% before I contribute. Making my contribution $75, which then grows 10x to $750 which I withdrawl tax free.

I know that there are other benefits to each type of account, but I'm specifically asking about the point I always hear about ""Tax Free Growth"". The math doesn't seem to indicate that you end up with more money if your account grows tax free, so what meant by the benefit of tax free growth?",63,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1fj8dgb/why_is_roth_better_because_of_tax_free_growth/,1726601341.0,Tmorr,1fj8dgb,advice_seeking
investing,invest $1000,What to do with 100k inheritance ,"My husband and I recently inherited 100k from family. It’s currently sitting in a money market account.

We make 140k combined total income, and have our first baby on the way in a few months. 

We already own a house with a 2.62% interest rate, and initially thought we’d use the 100k as a down payment for a house in the suburbs. The idea being we would rent our current house out and net anywhere from $1000-$1500 a month.

After house searching for a few weeks, everything I would want for a family home is out of our budget, so we started to think about other ways to invest that money. Should we just keep it in a money market? Buy a franchise? Invest in a business? Buy another rental property? 

We both have a dream of retiring early and somehow having a passive income. What’s the best use of this 100k to give us the lifestyle we want? How can we make this money really work for us? 

TLDR: Inherited 100k that’s currently sitting in a money market account. We have another 80k in a Roth IRA, and about 100k in equity in our current home. We have very middle class jobs and make 140k combined but we have no debt and we’re good savers. 

Do we:
-Buy our forever home for our growing family 
-Buy a rental property, 
- Buy a franchise of some kind 
- Invest in some kind of turn key business? Maybe e-commerce?

Fulgent ($FLGT) trades at ~$18.5 with net cash of ~$26.9 /share, yet its core diagnostics business still grows +7% YoY, market penetration <1%, and TAM set to expand ~7× this decade. Previous “cash-rich traps” either never hit liftoff (Vivus, Sesen) or were past their peak (BlackBerry, Sun). Fulgent is solidly in the steep-growth part of the S-curve.

⸻

What is Fulgent?
	•	Core lab: CLIA-certified NGS diagnostics (oncology, reproductive, rare disease)
	•	2024 results: Core revenue $281.2 M (+7% YoY); 2025 guide ~$310 M
	•	Balance sheet: $828.6 M cash & equivalents (no debt) → $26.87 cash/share
	•	Market cap: ~$570 M (≈30.8 M shares × $18.5)

Why “value trap”?
	1.	COVID windfall gone; bears assume core collapse
	2.	Biotech cash-burn scars
	3.	Small-cap illiquidity scares pros

S-curve positioning

```

```


	•	TAM: $12 B → $91 B by 2034 (23% CAGR)
	•	Penetration: ~0.3% today (281/91,300)

Lessons from past value traps keeps investors away
	•	Vivus: soft-launch weight-loss drug → no fit → burned cash → Ch 11
	•	Sesen Bio: FDA rejection → no product → reverse merger → shareholder wipe

Those companies were too early in the S curve and never got traction.

	•	BlackBerry: post-peak tech disruption → slow cash bleed on dead phones
	•	Sun Micro: dot-com plateau → $4 B mis-acquisition → sold at near cash

Those companies were too late in the S curve and couldn’t pivot.

Contrast: Fulgent’s core is profitable and in high-growth mode, not pre-lift-off or past peak.

Possible Catalysts ahead and future thesis material to cover: 
	•	New oncology & reproductive panels in 2H 2025
	•	As revenue grows from conservative guidance, market cap will grow, 1 billion and 2 billion market cap levels re-infuse more investment from larger firms
	•	Automation & AI accelerate discovery, and reduce R&D
	•	Disciplined M&A (Inform Dx deal = ~20% of cash)
	•	Therapeutics arm in early trials offers a second growth vector

Risks to watch
	•	Core growth slipping below ~10% CAGR
	•	An outsized (> $400 M) non-core acquisition
	•	Onerous regulation that stalls adoption
	•	Pharma pipeline missing key milestones

investing,what to do with extra money,"Trade Wars and Treasuries, or, How I Learned to Start Worrying and Watch the Bonds
(A longform ELI5 explainer on why the bond market is reacting — and why that's dangerous)","OK Reddit, I have been asked to synthesize a few ELI5 posts I made over the past week into an explainer, because folks found them helpful.  Believe me, it’s an exciting action story, covering the fall of Randy Reliable, cutthroat geopolitical macroeconomics, and some face-punching.  And you’ll learn why people in the know are worried. 

**TL;DR**: Bond yields aren’t just a number — they’re a signal of trust. And when the 10-year treasury starts rising during a market crash, it’s not a good sign. It means the world is losing faith in the U.S. Here’s why that’s dangerous, what it says about our leadership, and how macroeconomic pressure is the new frontline in geopolitical power.

## **Trade Wars and Tariffs, or, *How I Learned to Start Worrying and Watch the Bonds***

Over the past two weeks, equity markets have plummeted in response to Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcement.  However, by the middle of last week, the 10-year treasury yield began to rise sharply overnight. Those in the know started to worry- a lot.  The following day, Trump significantly revised some of his tariff policy, citing bond market “queasiness."" This brief primer is designed to help ordinary folks understand the basics and gain the macroeconomic literacy necessary to grasp these times, what may be happening, and why it is so concerning. 

## **What is a Treasury Bond?**

Imagine the U.S. government borrows money from people for 10 years and promises to pay them back with a little extra (interest). That “little extra” is called the yield. A treasury is essentially that. It’s an instrument through which the government borrows money and agrees to pay back more after a certain period of time.  So the 10-year treasury is a loan the government will repay in 10 years with a bit more.

Let’s say I buy a treasury for $10 and receive $11 back from the government over 10 years. That’s a 10% return over its lifespan, or about 0.96% annually if compounded, but approximately 1% per year if simplified. We refer to that as a 1% yield.

Why does selling bonds cause prices to decrease? It's simple: supply and demand, just as selling stocks lowers their prices. When you suddenly sell a large quantity of anything, the price drops because supply exceeds demand.

Now let’s say I sell that bond for $8 because someone is dumping bonds and prices are falling. That bond still pays $11 over its life. So the person who buys it from me is getting a $3 gain on an $8 investment — or a 37.5% total return over 10 years. This translates to about a 3.2% annual return (compounded) — a big jump from the original 1% yield! 

As you can see, when bond prices go down, yields go up — they move inversely.

This is worth emphasizing:  The U.S. always repays the same amount ($11) regardless of how much someone later buys the bond for on the secondary market ($8).

- If the bond sells for $12 later, the U.S. pays back $11.

- If the bond sells for $10 later, the U.S. pays $11.

- If the bond sells for $8 later, the U.S. pays $11.

The reason the yield changes is not due to what the U.S. repays, but because the secondary market buyer paid a different amount for that return.   Making back $11 from a $12, $10, or $8 investment results in different profits, and thus different yields.

Why would someone sell a bond for $8 at a loss that is guaranteed to eventually pay $11 (in 10 years)?  Because they need the $8 now and don't want to wait 10 years for the bond to mature!  Or they might think they can get better than a 3.2% return by investing the money elsewhere.  Just as it makes sense for you to withdraw money from your bank account, even if it's guaranteed to earn you 2% interest, because you need to pay your rent or because you believe you can do better than 2% by YOLO-ing into 0-day TSLA puts.

## **Why Should I Care About the 10-Year Treasury?**

Remember my example where I sold my bond for $8, which caused the yield to rise to 3.2%? Now, when the government needs to borrow money again, it can’t offer the previous 1% yield. Why? Because people can simply buy that 3.2% yielding bond on the open market. To stay competitive, the government must raise the interest rate on new bonds to satisfy market demands. As a result, it ends up paying more to borrow money.

Think about it this way:  Imagine you’re a builder in a town called Springville. For years, you’ve successfully sold one-bathroom houses for $100,000. However, Springville has evolved. It's now a family-oriented town, and everyone wants two bathrooms. The one-bathroom homes you previously built are now selling for only $50,000 on the resale market, as buyers realize they will need to spend an additional $50,000 to add a second bathroom.

Here’s the issue: You can’t continue building one-bathroom houses and expect to sell them for $100,000. Buyers won’t be interested. Why would they, when the market values a one-bathroom home at $50,000?

If you want to maintain that $100,000 price tag, you’ll need to provide more value, such as including the second bathroom from the beginning. The same applies to the U.S. Treasury. If it wishes to keep issuing debt, it has to match what the market currently provides. Otherwise, investors will simply look elsewhere.

You might say:  Well, so what? I don’t care what the government pays in interest.  Not my problem!

*Oh, it is very, very much your problem.*

This is because the 10-year treasury yield is a benchmark.  Many other loans (like mortgages, car loans, student loans, and business loans) key off of it.

So when the yield goes up, it means the U.S. government has to pay more to borrow — and so do you.

Higher yields = higher interest rates across the board.

That’s bad for:

- **Homebuyers** – higher mortgage rates = higher monthly payments

- **Businesses** – higher borrowing costs = harder to invest, hire, or expand

- **The government** – more of the federal budget goes toward interest payments instead of programs like schools or infrastructure

- **The stock market** – investors shift money out of stocks and into safe, high-yielding bonds, pushing stock prices down

Basically, because so many interest rates are tied to the 10-year treasury yield, any increase in that yield raises the cost of capital for the entire economy. Getting money becomes more expensive. Business slows down. At the same time, stock prices drop.

It’s a double whammy.

That’s why people watch the health of the treasury market so closely — because it impacts nearly everything in the economy, even if you don’t own a single bond yourself.

## **Why is the 10-Year treasury such an important benchmark?**

I want to say “just because” — but that wouldn’t satisfy you.

It’s not that the 10-year treasury must be the benchmark, but it’s the one everyone watches because it hits the sweet spot.

Treasuries (so far) are considered “risk-free.” They’re backed by the U.S. government and are super liquid. That liquidity and low risk provide the market a ton of real-time data about inflation expectations and the overall cost of capital. So they’re a natural baseline for figuring out what riskier borrowing should cost.

Imagine you have a friend, Randy Reliable, who’s always good for his money. Everyone is willing to loan him money at 2%. He borrows a lot, so there’s plenty of data on what rate people charge him — and you can be confident that 2% is the right baseline.

Then Sam Suspicious comes along and wants to borrow. You don’t know exactly what to charge him, but since you know what Randy pays, you simply add a risk premium to that. That’s how the market treats borrowers — it builds off the known “risk-free” rate.

But why the 10-year treasury specifically? It’s not too short (like a 2-year) or too long (like a 30-year). It captures market expectations about inflation, economic growth, and Fed policy over a medium-to-long horizon, making it the go-to reference point for many long-term loans.

Many countries have their own 10-year bond benchmarks, but Randy Reliable, the U.S. 10-year treasury, remains the gold standard globally.  In Europe, most euro-denominated contracts don’t key off the U.S. treasury. Instead, the German 10-year Bund is the de facto benchmark; it’s seen as the most stable and liquid bond in the Eurozone.  Other examples include:

- UK 10-year Gilt – a common benchmark for domestic British rates.

- Japanese 10-year  – used domestically, though heavily influenced by BOJ policy.

- Chinese 10-year – also exists, but tends to be more policy-driven and less market-transparent.

These bonds exist and are useful, but their reliability and global relevance can vary, especially when markets perceive a government as unstable, opaque, or overly interventionist.

The US 10-year beats these because it checks all the boxes:

- Deep liquidity

- Transparent, market-based pricing

- Long track record of stability

- Dollar dominance — many contracts worldwide are USD-denominated

- Safe-haven status during global crises

When benchmarking global risk, Randy Reliable (aka the U.S. 10Y) remains the handsome, well-dressed guy with a good credit score.  If you benchmark against another country and it suddenly does something wild (Brexit, for example), you get burned. That’s why predictability is essential — investors need confidence, not surprises.

## **So It’s Good to Be Randy Reliable?**

Yes, it is indeed good to be Randy Reliable. The dollar’s position as the global reserve currency grants the U.S. considerable soft power. Countries often avoid financially attacking the U.S. as those actions tend to backfire on their own economies, making economic retaliation against the U.S. both risky and costly.  Additionally, high global demand for U.S. dollars keeps the dollar strong internationally, allowing Americans to purchase foreign goods more affordably.

However, there’s a downside:

A strong dollar also makes American exports more expensive, which can hurt U.S. manufacturers selling abroad.

That’s why undermining the dollar's status as a reserve currency is an unspoken (but nearly essential) goal of Trump's agenda, even if he is not fully aware of it.  Yet, it’s a perilous strategy as it significantly weakens the U.S.  A good article discussing all this can be found here:  https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/how-trump-could-dethrone-dollar.

## **It All Comes Down to Trust and Predictability?**

Now you’re getting it.  The yield on the 10-year is seen as a key indicator of trust in the U.S. economy and its macroeconomic leadership.

So what if old Randy Reliable develops a ketamine habit and begins threatening his friends?  Well, suddenly he doesn’t seem like such a safe person to lend to. 

This is why the “long part of the curve” for treasuries (i.e., 10-year, 30-year) is often seen as an indicator of the financial health of the United States economy.  Are we Randy Reliable or Randy Reckless?  That’s the question the world is asking right now, and it reflects in the yield curve. Add potential strategic bond selling pressure from China and other countries on top of that, and we have a problem.  I’ll get to that in a bit.

## **The Yield is the Entire Field**

So, putting it all together, the 10-year yield is a key barometer of the health and strength of the U.S. economy and the trust in American economic leadership.  As that trust erodes, folks see the U.S. as a riskier borrower.  So the rates they’re comfortable charging to loan money to the U.S. go up. 

Typically, during periods of financial uncertainty, the yield on 10-year treasuries goes DOWN.  That’s because long treasuries – lending to Randy Reliable – have always been regarded as a safe haven.  Remember, it represents the risk-free rate!  When equities (stocks) weaken, investors usually shift their money into that safe place.  More buyers lead to an increase in the value of treasuries. Because value and yield are inversely related, the 10-year yield declines.

But that’s not what we saw last week!  Instead, while stock prices were falling, the 10-year yield was increasing.  That was… weird.  The markets no longer saw treasuries as their safe haven.  That’s a scary thought.  It implied a market losing faith in the United States and concluding it was actually Randy Reckless. 

## **Wasn’t I Supposed to Be Worried About an Inverted Yield Curve?**

Aren’t higher long-term bond yields a good thing?  You may have heard that an inverted yield curve is a worrisome sign.  That’s when long-term bonds have a lower yield than short-term bonds.  This situation is also anomalous because you would expect longer-term loans to have higher risk.  More time means a greater opportunity for the lender to default or for inflation to wreck you.  This higher risk typically leads to a higher rate of long-term bonds compared to short-term bonds. 

An inverted yield curve is a signal.  It historically signals a recession and is worth monitoring.  Remember, when equities and other investments decline, we expect people to seek safety – like Randy Reliable – leading to a drop in 10-year yields. Therefore, while an inverted yield curve is concerning, it’s still NORMAL. It remains just a signal, not a systemic risk in itself.

Rising 10-year yields during market weakness present a different type of danger: strategic selling by foreign holders or a decline in confidence in U.S. creditworthiness.

That’s not a recession signal. That is the disease.

That’s a sovereign confidence event.

Different animal. Nastier teeth.

## **What Does China, Japan, and Canada Have to do with This?**

Now, China has almost $800 billion in treasuries (and they are also a big buyer, which creates demand). Japan holds even more — about $1 trillion.  Canada also has a sizeable holding. These can move markets.

And remember, even if China holds only a small fraction of the total outstanding treasuries, what matters is the float — that is, how much is being bought and sold at any given time. For example, suppose typically 1% of the houses in your city are on sale at any time. Now, a real estate mogul decides to sell all of his houses, which make up 2% of the housing stock. That’s a small fraction of all the homes in the city, but it triples the supply for sale. There aren’t enough buyers for that. So, prices drop. A lot.

Even though it’s just a 2% change in total inventory, it’s a huge disruption to normal market activity. Japan, China, and Canada can impact the treasury market in a similar way. If they sell a lot at once, particularly if others are selling treasuries too, there simply won’t be enough buyers with cash ready, and that’s what we refer to as a liquidity crunch or a low-liquidity situation. Since China is a major buyer of treasuries, it can also influence the demand side by halting its purchases.

## **Bond Market Chess vs. Trade War Checkers**

Conversely, the increase in the 10-year yield last week may have resulted from major sovereign bondholders striking the United States right where it hurts.  They can engage in macroeconomic Bond Market Chess while Trump and the United States play Tariff Checkers.  And China, Japan, and Canada wouldn’t even need to crash the market — just sell slowly and steadily, nudging the long end of the yield curve upward over time. This matches what we are witnessing now. That alone can quietly erode the U.S. economy. Think boiling frog.

The Chinese can then take the capital released from their treasury sales and reinvest it into their domestic economy — infrastructure, industrial policy, and innovation — effectively blunting the impact of a trade war. So, they’re hitting the brakes on us while stepping on the gas at home.

China is smart enough to know this, and they have the tools to do it.  So are Canada and Japan.  Indeed, the current Canadian Prime Minister, Mark Carney, is one of the smartest macroeconomic thinkers out there.  

The dollar’s status as the global reserve currency gives the U.S. immense advantages. But there’s no such thing as a free lunch, and this kind of yield exposure is the price we pay for that privilege. As the saying goes, “With great power comes great responsibility.”

When the U.S. is strong, stable, and globally engaged, the financial pool is too deep for even China and other countries to make a splash. But if we start pulling back from the global economy, undermining our own institutions, and projecting unreliability, that’s when the macroeconomic knives can come out and actually hurt us... a lot. This is particularly true if we, through belligerent economic policies,  encourage other Western or Western-aligned countries to collaborate against American interests.

This is exactly why people like me are warning that Trump’s policies are not only misguided but also economically dangerous, fundamentally undermining American power.

## **Can’t the Fed Do Something?**

Yes and no, but not really.  Yes, the Fed can step in and buy long-term treasuries — that’s what it did during previous rounds of Quantitative Easing (QE).

But there’s a catch: it’s much harder for the Fed to control the long end of the yield curve (10- and 30-year bonds) because those markets are massive and heavily influenced by investor sentiment regarding inflation, growth, and fiscal credibility.

When the Fed buys bonds, it can lower yields. However, doing so aggressively on the long end could send a dangerous signal: that the Fed is suppressing risk in a manner that markets may not deem sustainable.

If the underlying issue is fiscal credibility, QE can backfire — driving up inflation fears and ultimately causing long-term yields to rise instead of fall.

So yes, the Fed can intervene, but doing so risks unmooring inflation expectations, weakening the dollar, and undermining confidence in treasury markets.

## **So Why Not Just Make Those Chinese-Held Bonds Null and Void?**

After reading this primer, many have suggested, why don’t we just declare Chinese-held treasuries null and void? We have the power to take that leverage from them!

No, we do not have that power.  Do you want to crash the entire bond market and cause the US to default on its national debt?  Because that’s how you do it.  This would be an economic catastrophe of the highest order and would make the Great Depression look like a mere blip.

It’s as if someone is out there spreading rumors about your violent tendencies.  So, in retaliation, you publicly punch them in the face. Voiding China’s notes makes about as much sense.  It simply proves exactly what the market was unsure about.    

As an example, suppose you, Charlie, Joan, Peter, and Mary each loan me $10,000.

I decide I hate Peter and tell him I’m not paying back his loan and that I won’t repay it if he sells it to anyone else.  Peter’s loan becomes worthless.  This situation is called a default. 

Charlie, Joan, and Mary all realize that I could easily default on their loans as well.  So, they panic and sell their loans as quickly as they can because now they don’t trust me.

The value of the notes drops to zero or close to it because nobody trusts me to pay them back.

Now, I go out to the market and ask for more loans.  Nobody wants to lend me money except at extortionate rates.

## **What Can We Do?**

Ultimately, fixing this will require a great deal of time and rebuilding trust.  Unfortunately, trust is not something the Fed can print out of thin air, or that the President of the United States can enact through an Executive Order.  Trust comes from relationships and time.

There’s an old adage:  Trust takes decades to build, a moment to lose, and forever to regain.  We are witnessing that in real time.  Restoring trust may well take decades now.  There will be no easy fix.  Hopefully, now that you understand the macroeconomic issues, you can begin the hard work ahead.

investing,what to do with extra money,"The best ""Life-Forward"" move for my son?","So, my son (18) is graduating highschool in a few weeks and has landed himself a great job starting the week after he's done with school. He will be making $23/hr (in our area, that's pretty stupidly great money, especially for an 18 yr old kid). He is coming to live with me for a while so he can save some money and get himself on a good path in life while he decides what he wants to do (school, military, career, etc). 
I will be charging him rent but aside from putting a little extra into the household expenses, I'm planning to put most of it back for him as a ""you did good, here's a gift to get you going"" thing when he moves out as I'm doing reasonably well myself and don't really need the extra. 
Now, having said all that, I'm wanting to know what I can have HIM invest in while he's working to set himself up as well as he can. I'm already helping him separately save up an emergency fund ($1500) and money for some other expenses we know he will have, but aside from that, I want him to put some money into some long term stuff that will set him up as well as is possible while he's got this opportunity. 
So are there some good general funds, mutual funds, I know target date funds tend to under-perform so we're staying away from those, but like, what can I have him sink a few hundred dollars a month into without it going to waste?

investing,what to do with extra money,Dividend Irrelevance Theory,"There is a popular subset of the investing community that focuses on generating income through dividend paying companies. The goal is to create an income stream that can either supplement or replace active income from employment. Dividend-paying stocks often feel ""safe"" to these investors, as they provide regular, tangible cash payments, which activates certain reward centers in the brain. This stands in contrast to the perceived uncertainty and volatility of a total return approach, where investors must depend on fluctuating stock prices for their returns. But while dividends feel safe and reliable, there’s more going on under the surface. 

**Dividend Irrelevance Theory (Modigliani and Miller)**

The Dividend Irrelevance Theory, proposed by Modigliani and Miller (MM) in 1961, asserts that dividend policy has no impact on a firm’s value or cost of capital in a frictionless market. Under this theory, a company’s value is determined solely by its earnings power and investment decisions, not by how it distributes its profits. Whether profits are retained or distributed, the firm’s underlying valuation remains the same.

In an efficient market, a stock’s price converges to its book value per share plus the present value of its future earnings. When a company issues a dividend, it typically does so when it cannot reinvest its profits in any profitable investments. Therefore, expected future earnings should remain unaffected. This means that the share price should drop by the same amount as the dividend paid out, as the decrease in the firm’s cash holdings lowers the book value per share.

Empirical evidence, such as the drop in stock prices on the ex-dividend date, supports this theory. When a dividend is paid, the share price tends to decrease by the amount of the dividend, as cash leaving the company is reflected by a reduction in book value per share. This indicates that shareholders are not gaining extra value, just converting it from one form (capital appreciation) into another (cash). The key here is fungibility. There is no reason why $1 in the form of a dividend should be preferred more than $1 in the form of capital appreciation.

**The Role of Asset Pricing Models in Analyzing Dividend Stocks**

While Modigliani and Miller’s theory holds under certain assumptions, real markets have frictions, and historical data has shown that dividend paying stocks tended to outperform their non dividend paying counterparts. If dividends don’t inherently add value, why is this the case?

This is where asset pricing comes into play. I encourage you to see my post on Asset pricing for more information, but to give a brief summary, we have identified 5 factors which are believed to be proxies for excess exposure to underlying systematic risks that stocks with certain characteristics have. Stocks with higher exposure to systematic risk should have higher expected returns, as you are paying a deeper discount for future earnings. The risk factors are as follows.

1. **Market Risk (Mkt-RF)**: The excess return of the market over the risk-free rate (proxied by treasury bills)
2. **Size (SMB)**: The premium earned by small-cap stocks relative to large-cap stocks.
3. **Value (HML)**: The premium associated with high book-to-market value stocks (value stocks) over low book-to-market value stocks (growth stocks).
4. **Profitability (RMW)**: The premium associated with stocks with robust profitability over weak profitability stocks.
5. **Investment (CMA)**: The premium of firms with conservative investment (low asset growth) over aggressive investment firms.

Running what is called a factor regression, we can determine how much dividend paying stocks are exposed to the underlying risks these factors are proxying for, based on how a dividend paying ETF covaries with each factor premium. See below an example of this factor regression for Schwab’s US Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD).

[Regression done on Portfolio Visualizer](https://preview.redd.it/y11ok31tmusd1.png?width=1562&format=png&auto=webp&s=e099f569509f42986d240b38bd9a351761e10f0b)

The regression results show that dividend payers have statistically significant exposure to the Market, Value, Profitability, and Investment factors, with high explanatory power (R² = 90.4%). The alpha, or unexplained return, is statistically indistinguishable from zero. This suggests that dividend paying stocks do not have unique value adding characteristics that cannot be explained by their exposure to these risk factors.

What this means is a dividend portfolio’s performance can be replicated through targeting the risk factors directly. This finding challenges the conventional wisdom that dividend payers are safer investments, because this regression clearly shows that they are exposed to additional risk. See below a comparison of the returns of Schwab’s US Dividend Equity ETF and a hypothetical factor tilted portfolio with the same exposure to those risk factors.

https://preview.redd.it/uhifc7j0nusd1.png?width=1518&format=png&auto=webp&s=85ad46f5496dd6588a24aaa4440ef3ced5162665

You can see how closely they track each other. This goes against the conventional wisdom that dividend payers are safer. Dividend investors should reassess their asset allocation assuming they chose dividend stocks due to risk aversion.

**Why targeting risk factors directly is a better idea**

Given that dividend payers performance can be replicated by targeting risk factors like value, profitability, and investment, a more efficient approach might be to directly allocate to these factors through diversified factor based strategies. Here’s why:

* **More tax efficient**: Since dividend distributions are taxable, targeting these factors is often more tax efficient, especially in a taxable brokerage account. Capital gains taxes are only triggered upon sale and can be delayed into perpetuity, while dividends create an immediate tax liability.
* **Broader Opportunity Set**: By targeting the underlying risk factors, investors avoid limiting themselves to dividend paying stocks, which tend to be concentrated in certain sectors like utilities, consumer staples for example. This broader opportunity set allows investors to gain exposure to value and profitability factors across a wider range of companies.
* **Why Defer Spending Plans to Corporate Dividend Policy?:** Corporations never take into consideration your spending needs, so why rely on them? To repeat, the key here is fungibility. There is no reason to prefer $1 in the form of a dividend over $1 in the form of a capital gain. If you need money from your investment portfolio, you can sell your shares, and cater the plan to your needs. Dividend focused plans have no considerations of your actual needs.
* **Market Inefficiency and Behavioral errors**: Investors often chase dividend yields during low interest rate environments, driving up the prices of high yielding stocks. This creates a temporary premium that is unlikely to persist long term. The preference for dividend stocks during low rate periods might reflect that the asset is overvalued due to the behavioral errors of investors. By focusing on these factors directly, investors can avoid the pitfalls of paying a premium for what is essentially an income preference rather than a sound investment decision.

Final note: This does not mean that dividends are inherently bad or that you should avoid them altogether. However, dividends themselves are an irrelevant criterion for investment selection. Investors should consider whether their preference for dividend stocks is driven by misconceptions around safety or income generation, rather than sound investment strategy.  A stocks value ultimately comes from its future earnings and risk characteristics, not from how it distributes cash.",99,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1fwgg7t/dividend_irrelevance_theory/,1728095735.0,Swole_Bodry,1fwgg7t,not_advice_seeking
investing,what to do with extra money,Are there better options than a HYSA for semi-liquid savings?,"Hi everyone,

I have read through MANY posts on here and several investing articles (most seem to be selling something). I am also still relatively new at investing outside of my 401K and Roth IRA. That is why I thought I would go ahead and post this question to get your opinions on this.

Here is a quick history... I was planning to pay our house off early, but with a 2.875% mortgage and interest rates going up I decided to put the extra in a HYSA. For the last couple of years it has been over 5% and just recently dropped below, with the latest Fed cut. Including the emergency fund, I now have about $150K in the HYSA. I also have a son graduating in May (and two daughters following in the 3 years following) and will likely need to pull from this to help with college expenses over the next decade.

My question is this, is there a better place to put this money now that HYSA rates are dropping? I expect they will continue to drop given the Fed's current direction. I have considered Dividend ETF's, MMF's, REIT ETF's, etc. I am a little nervous putting needed cash in a market ETF give the stellar run the markets have had over the last two years. At some point, one would think there has to be a correction. Some of the data appears to point to this, I think, but I am really a novice at this.

I would love to hear your suggestions, what-I-would-do's, and recommendations given my scenario. It seems like there should be a method to find 5-7% with relatively low risk... or maybe I am just dreaming.  Thanks!",99,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1fzckr9/are_there_better_options_than_a_hysa_for/,1728426750.0,PhilD41,1fzckr9,advice_seeking
investing,what to do with extra money,Pay the Mortgage off or invest???,"So I spent too much time debating finance with people tonight on a guys post wondering if he'd be better off investing or paying off a mortgage with an extra 600 a month.  

I'm gonna do some math to show the long term outcome so you can decide what is better with round smaller numbers... 

I owe 200k on a mortgage  that I'm paying 2.5% on and have 30 years left to pay at the defined payment obligation. 

At the end of the month after all bills are paid i have 500$ left over.  Do I use that to pay down my Mortgate or do I invest it. 

Most of the responces were invest it and I assume that was thinking liquid money is worth more then house money but is it???

Mortgage loans are heavily weighted... in as much as the first 1/3 of the time you are paying mostly interest and very little to the principle. 


If your paying just your mortgage payment you will be paying the lender on above stated money... you will pay 5000 a year for the use of their money for the first 10 years or so.  

If you pay the extra 500$ a month to the mortgage even for 5 year the amount you owe will reduce.  However if you assume it's better to invest with a 5% net... here is the math

500x12=6000 
6000x .05 = 300$ 

So if every month you put 500$,in an investment that will make 5% the following year you will make 300$

Which is greater?  

Paying off 5000$ a year debt or making 300$ a year?  

Every year that you put that extra into the mortgage on a 30 year note, for at least half the time,  the loan you are reducing what you owe at a much faster pace then what you would make on interest.

There are exceptions... say you roll the dice 6 months ago and put it into 20$ a share Palantir... but... thats highly unlikely... with the ups and downs of any given market 5% annual income is safe bets.  

At no time no matter your tax load or expenses are you not better off paying down a 200k @2.5% interest rate debt then investing.  Sure liquidity is good for many reasons so put 100 a month into a high yield secure vehical at 4% for liquid... but reducing your debt by 400-500a month is far better then making 500$ a year.

investing,bonus invest,Almost debt free — pay down $8.5K at 8% or invest bonus while market is down?,"TLDR: Should I use a $4,400 bonus to finish paying off high-interest debt (~$8.5K at 7.98%), or invest it while ETFs (VOO/QQQM/SMH) are “on sale”?

I drastically cut discretionary spending this year and have already paid off $10K of debt, with ~$8,500 remaining at 7.98%.

I’m getting a $7,400 bonus on 4/30 (expecting about $4,400 after taxes). Obviously I should put all of that toward the remaining debt, right? Or is it too good an opportunity to pass up buying quality ETFs (VOO, QQQM, SMH) while they’re relatively cheap?

Without the bonus, I’m on track to pay off the debt by December at $1,300/month. Paying it off sooner would save me about $200 in interest. But lump summing or dollar-cost-averaging into the market could potentially grow into a lot more in just a few years.

What would you do in my position?

Other info that might be relevant:
	•	40M, single, live in NYC
	•	Behind on retirement savings (have about 1/3 of what the internet says I should have by now)
	•	~6 months of emergency savings
	•	Previously paused investing to focus on debt payoff
	•	Very little invested outside my retirement account
	•	No immediate need for this bonus money

I know paying down debt is a guaranteed return, but I’m trying to think long-term and not miss opportunities like I have in the past. But this is also the closest I’ve ever been to being completely debt-free in my adult life (all my fault), and I’m excited to finally get there.

investing,bonus invest,Ran 5-year investment analysis vs $1.2M Bay Area home purchase - Is it better to walk away and keep renting?,"We're considering walking away from a $1.2M townhome purchase in the East Bay and want to validate our thinking before making this final decision.

# Our Financial Situation

* Household income: \~$360k base with annual bonuses (adds 12-18% yearly)
* Down payment ready: $400k
* Current rent: $3k/month for 2br/2ba with rent control protections
* Market rate for similar rentals: $2800 -4,200+ in our area

# The Property Details

The townhome is in Dublin and is in a newer development near good schools, but comes with some high costs:

* Mello Ross: \~$500+ monthly for 25+ years (until around 2050)
* HOA fees: $440/month
* Property taxes: Standard rate but on $1.2M assessment
* Financing: Looking at 6.875% rates in current market or 5.875 for 5 year ARM

# Our Analysis

When we calculated total monthly ownership costs versus our current situation, we would be paying approximately $4,500 MORE per month than we do now. This includes mortgage, taxes, special assessments, HOA, insurance.

Here's where it gets interesting: We ran a 5-year scenario assuming the house appreciates at 7% annually (aggressive but possible in this market). Even with that appreciation, investing our $400k down payment plus the $4,500 monthly difference in index funds would give us nearly $1M in investable assets after 5 years.

This means we could potentially put down 60%+ on a $1.68M house (what this one would cost in 5 years) versus 33% today. So basically, we would move from barely affording the down payment to having enough to buy most of the house outright.

# Why We're Hesitating

The math seems almost too good to be true, which makes us wonder if we're missing something important. The Mello Roos special assessments really hurt the economics - that's $500+ monthly (2% increase every year) that provides no return and continues for decades.

# Our Questions

1. Are we being too conservative by assuming we can consistently invest the monthly difference?
2. Is there a flaw in comparing liquid investments to real estate ownership benefits?
3. Are we underestimating the non-financial benefits of homeownership?
4. Could we be missing tax advantages or other factors that change the calculation?
5. Is the ""priced out forever"" fear legitimate, or does the math actually work in our favor?

We genuinely liked this property and the location, but the numbers made us step back. The special assessments(Mello Roos) alone would cost us \~$180k+ over 25 years - money that could compound significantly if invested instead.

Has anyone else done similar analysis when facing Bay Area purchase decisions? Are we overthinking this, or does the investment approach make sense given current market conditions?

**TL;DR**: Running numbers on $1.2M Bay Area townhome vs continuing to rent + invest. Math suggests waiting 5 years while investing creates much stronger financial position even with home appreciation.

investing,getting started investing,Today I made $1m gains by selling my entire Nvidia portfolio,"Today marks perhaps my greatest investing milestone of all time!  The short story is I bought $36,000 worth of Nvidia over the course of 8 years. Last year I told myself once my account breaks $1m profit, I will sell the entire position, lock in the gains, and have a hell of a story to share for life.  Well today Nvidia hit a new all time high and I made that dream come true.

Below is a long version of how it all came to be: 

I first acquired Nvidia back in Feb 2017 and in a few lump sum purchases wound up with a total of 6,500 shares of NVDA.  My first purchase was for 1080 (in honor of my GTX 1080 I bought that year) and the share price at the time was a whopping $2.77!  My total investment around this time was $4000.  

Edit: I looked up the actual purchase numbers and the number of shares was actually 27 at $110 but since Nvidia had split multiple times, the number shown in my report today was reflecting those splits.  End of edit 

Back in 2017 all the talk was about Crypto mining and I naively thought Nvidia was the way Bitcoin would be mined forever so I bought into the mantra “during a gold rush, buy the company selling the shovels”.  This was around the time BTC hit $20,000 for the first time but it quickly collapsed and I was introduced into the volatility of the crypto world.  But I still held my Nvidia because I believed crypto was still at an early adoption stage.  

Over the next few years I continued to buy small amounts of Nvidia, in chunks of 100 shares here, 900 shares here, and eventually had 6,000 shares by 2019.  The average cost of all of these were around $2-$8 in today’s value.  

2019 is a significant milestone for me because I made a major life decision to move to Puerto Rico.  This move was made for several reasons but one consideration is the 0% tax on capital gains from stock sales.  I didn’t consider Nvidia being the one stock to move for but one reason for selling the whole lot was to lock in the 0% capital gains today 

I remember somewhere around 2019-2020 starting to think that GPUs and Nvidia specifically weren’t going to be tied to crypto as much as it would be the hardware needed to power self driving cars.  The hype around Tesla was growing and crypto mining started moving away from personal computers and I learned GPUs were falling out of favor for more powerful ASIC mining rigs.  So my mentality moved from Crypto to Electric Vehicles.  Keep in mind, I really didn’t know a lot about any of this and I view my Nvidia convictions at the time more as luck looking back.  

Then in 2020 the Pandemic hit and we saw major sales of GPUs for gaming, virtual reality, and supply chain disruption and of course massive inflation.  Stocks across the board were super volatile but in general things went bonkers in the tech sector.  Tesla was killing it and Nvidia might have doubled during this time.  It still had not gone parabolic yet but I still just kept holding onto my initial position.  My portfolio wasn’t really moving in any major way yet and in early 2019 I was actually slightly negative in my total Nvidia investment.  

Then in 2023 we saw the first mainstream use cases for Ai started popping up.  I’m in the photography and videography world so I noticed how disruptive image and video creation would be as soon as it hit.  All my colleagues were making images in Midjourney when the majority of my non photo friends had no clue what Ai image generation even was.  It ballooned quickly and that’s when my mind set changed a third time. Now Nvidia was going to be needed for data centers and personal computers to power this new Ai revolution.  It wasn’t about crypto or self driving cars anymore, it was about perhaps the biggest innovation humanity has seen since the internet was launched and the iPhone was revealed.  

Seemingly overnight my portfolio was sky rocking.  Where just a few years prior, Nvidia was in the red for me, it quickly started carving out a large portion of my portfolio.  Once a liability, Nvidia now made up 10%, 20%, and 30% of my entire investment account and retirement funds.  There were days when I would log in to see I had made $100,000 that day and a week later it would swing down -$105,000.  It was pretty crazy to see a full year’s worth of income bouncing around day by day in my account.  The temptation to sell had always been there since 2017 when I was up 20-100% but now I was up 4,000% and the temptation was even greater.  Every single one of my friends was telling me I had to take profits off the table.  I wound up holding.  

The last major purchase I made was in July 2021. I bought 400 shares for $14 which at the time was 3-5x what I had bought previously.  

Jump to June 2024 when Nvidia hit an all time high of $130.  My wife and I had just had our first child and my Nvidia position was hovering around $800,000 in total gains.  I knew I only had to make it to $160 per share to break the $1m mark and I told myself I would sell everything if that happened.  Of course the next month Nvidia corrected pretty hard and the reality of hitting $160 didn’t seem possible until July 3rd 2025, nearly a year after I made my original decision to sell.  

I should have sold everything on July 3rd but I didn’t realize the trading day was shortened for the 4th of July holiday coming up. I also didn’t setup any automated sell triggers since I wanted to ceremoniously do the trade myself.  It worked out in my favor as I was able to sell today at $163 and make a little more than the $1m cutoff I originally set to sell at. 

Here are the raw numbers:

Total invested: $36,352
Total sale: $1,059,591
Total gains: $1,023,238
Average cost per share: $5.60
Time to materialize: 8 years and a lot of emotional rollercoasters!


I know a lot of people get caught up in fancy investment options that feels more like gambling but hopefully this success story inspires those of you who are like me and just what to buy shares, hold them, and eventually offload them when the time seems right.

investing,getting started investing,How to get a loved one to see the benefit to investing early,"I am currently 23 and just moved in with my girlfriend - also 23 - and I have always been pretty into finance and the world of investing for the future, starting at 18 finishing high school. My girlfriend is close to the opposite, but in no way is she irresponsible with money.

I have dropped mentions of her starting to invest from age 18-22 but increasingly so now that we have both graduated college and are in full-time positions with limited expenses. Ive tried to get her to 200$ a month but even that feels like way to much, while im investing close to 1/3 of my net. She did setup a reoccurring investment of 5$ a week but it feels like a wasted opportunity...

How can I convince her to invest more of her money while we are still young and see the outlook of what this can do for you?

Update: we talked yesterday, I ran through the various reasons why investing early is important and doesnt mean you ""lose"" the money when its invested.

investing,getting started investing,"Turning 18 very soon, always planned to start investing - I’m now concerned due to Trump/ economy","Hi, I’m turning 18 very soon and am from the UK. I planned for years to start investing my own money pretty much as soon as I turned 18, but a couple of weeks ago my parents said they would give me access to my savings and could use that to invest/ put into a bank account etc. 

The amount was higher than I had expected and of course I’m really happy and it will be such a useful starting point for investment. I intend to top up the investment fund monthly with spare money which I get from my job. I plan on using Trading 212, and putting the majority of the money into the S&P 500, a bit into the FTSE, and a tiny amount into a few others (I have QQQ, VUAG and VUSA written down but I can barely remember what they are and will do more research). 

The problem is, I keep seeing in the news/online about how, due to many things but especially the election of Trump, the economy is in a bad place right now and the stock market is very volatile. I don’t mind if the ROI is below average, I just don’t want to lose any money - especially my savings, which has been saved up my whole life by my family and could mess up my future if I lose. Should I invest now or wait a bit? Thanks!

investing,getting started investing,401k takes a long time to grow,"Hello community. 16 years ago my 401k seemed not to go anywhere. It was taking too long to climb to even $5,000. At times, I even thought about not contributing anymore as it felt I could use that money and get better things. Things like enjoy life. It took for ever to reach my first $100,000. Like I stated, I use to work for minimum wages and I am a late starter. I started contributing at 32 years old only because I was promoted to a job that matched 5% (I understood the free money concept). Investments were never a thing for my parents as they lived paycheck to paycheck. I was raised with the mentality that investing was only for rich people(wrong). Now, I am 48 years old and have moved to other jobs. For the last years, I have witnessed the power of compounding. I am so proud and happy I didn't stop contributing to my 401k when it seemed not to grow. Know, I fully agree with what is said about investing. Don't get disencouraged the first years as it feel it doesn't grow. My retirement portfolio is now $750,000 (aside from my house that has around $400,000 in equity). I should be able  payoff my house by age 56. My plan is to retire 12 years from now at 60 with $2,000,000. It feels possible. Regardless of where you come from, we all have a chance.

investing,how much to save,How My Parents Missed Out on Millions by Never Investing!,"My parents are both 62 now, and they’ve never really gotten into investing. They have a small amount in IRAs—maybe around $15,000 combined—but that’s about it. They’ve always just kept their money in a regular savings account with their bank. No high-yield savings accounts, no stocks, no mutual funds, and not even certificates of deposit (CDs). For decades, they’ve earned next to nothing in interest—probably less than $15 a month.

Growing up, we were a family of five. My dad earned around $85,000 a year, and my mom worked part-time, bringing in maybe $25,000 annually. We weren’t rich, but we were comfortable. They worked hard to provide for us, but they never prioritized investing or learned much about it. Now, as they’re getting closer to retirement, my dad still plans to work for a while since he runs his own business and enjoys it.

It’s honestly eye-opening to think about what could have been if they’d started investing earlier—like back in the '80s or '90s. Even a little bit in the stock market over all those years could’ve made a huge difference.

For me, I didn’t start investing until my late 20s because it wasn’t something we ever talked about at home. My parents never really understood it, so they never passed that knowledge down. It’s kind of surprising how much of an impact financial education (or lack of it) can have across generations.",1281,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1i7ykr4/how_my_parents_missed_out_on_millions_by_never/,1737619463.0,Puzzleheaded_Park102,1i7ykr4,advice_seeking

investing,how much to save,Has anyone elses parents or family members gone their whole lives without ever really investing?,"My parents are now both 65, and while they do have some small amount of money in IRA's (how much I don't know, but it seems to be very little like less than 20k), they have never invested their entire lives. They left their money in citibank their entire lives collecting virtually no interest at all (not even a HYSA, just a regular savings account that they only earn like $10 of interest a month), and of course never owned any stocks, ETF's, mutual funds or never even did any CD's at a bank.

They raised 4 kids (we're all adults now), and we were always around lower/middle class growing up. My father makes 100k a year roughly so we were never struggling growing up, and mother around 40k, but I'm just surprised they went their entire lives with basically investing practically nothing. So they went through their whole lives and are now on the verge of retirement, but my father works in sales so he'll probably continue to do it into his 70's since he likes it.

One of the reasons it took me so long to invest is because my parents literally know nothing about it and never told me anything about it growing up.

investing,how much to save,Financial professionals mostly aren't paid to care what happens to the S&P 500 the day after tomorrow,"Container volumes at the port of Los Angels are down this week. They'll be down farther next week. We know this because arrivals are scheduled in advance and crossing the ocean by boat takes awhile. Container volumes at east coast ports are expected to do the same thing, but on a delayed schedule, because ""Shanghai, through the Panama Canal to New York City"" is a longer trip than ""Shanghai to Los Angels"".

And because of *that*, it's a safe bet truckers will have trouble finding work next month. Large-scale retail layoffs seem likely to follow soon thereafter. Very little can be done to stop this, because even if the tariffs on China were lifted tomorrow, it takes 3-7 weeks to get merchandise from a Chinese port to an American retail store. (Plus, I feel pretty confident saying the tariffs on China won't be lifted any time soon.)

A natural question when you hear this is, ""if that's true, why isn't the stock market down more?"" And I think a lot of the answer to this question can be summed up as: **hardly anyone is paid to care.**

I was going to title this post ""financial professionals mostly aren't paid to care what happens to your index funds the day after tomorrow"", but the **index fund providers** *are* paid to care... in the sense that they are paid to care about minimizing tracking error. They are paid to make sure that when the index goes up X%, the fund captures those games, and when the index goes down Y%, the fund doesn't do any worse than that. But they aren't paid to know whether the index will be up or down tomorrow. And this is not a criticism! It's not their job.

Who's job is it? For **high-frequency traders**, it's pretty much the opposite of their job. Their job is to do a trade and unwind it a few milliseconds later at a penny-per-share profit. And some of the hate HFTs get strikes me as overwrought; before HFTs were skimming a penny a share off every trade, floor traders were skimming 12½ cents (because stock prices used to be quoted in eighths of a dollar). But HFTs definitely don't care about what's going to happen to the trucking industry next month.

Now, despite what you may have heard, HFTs aren't the *entire* stock market. HFTs like to do small, quick trades. So instead, if somebody wants to sell half a million shares of TSLA, they might call around to various **dealers** and ask for quotes. The dealers will quote numbers below what an HFT would pay for *ten* shares of TSLA, but hopefully high enough that the seller agrees to the deal, and then the dealers will need to sell the stock to someone else, and that can't be done in a matter of milliseconds. Maybe they unwind their position over the course of 24 hours. So when the dealer gives a quote, they might be thinking about what the market could do tomorrow—but they hope that by the day after tomorrow it will be somebody else's problem.

Okay, but those are the middle-men. What about **professional stock-pickers**, active mutual fund managers, long-short hedge fund managers? Unfortunately, they also aren't paid to care what the S&P 500 will do the day after tomorrow. Managers of actively managed mutual funds care how they do compared to their benchmark, which is generally an index. If the index is down, that's fine, as long as *their* stocks are down less (or perhaps realistically, for risk-averse managers, aren't down significantly more). Meanwhile, a long-short hedge fund, which buys some stocks while shorting others, wants to be able to tell its investors that whether the broad market is up or down will have *no effect whatsoever* on the fund's performance.

So yes, actively managed mutual funds and long-short hedge funds are going to take a longer-term view of stocks they are thinking of buying or selling. And yes, they will care if companies could be affected by tariffs more than others. But even if they start to suspect *every* company should be down as a result of tariffs, they're not going to smash a big red button labeled ""sell everything"", because that's not their job.

Maybe it's *somebody's* job to care, but honestly it's hard to come up with a good business model based around that sort of thing. If you realize a crash is coming, but get the timing wrong, you could lose a lot of money—like if you went all-in shorting the market in 1999, when the dot-com bubble wouldn't burst until the following year. And if get the timing of *this* crash right because you bothered to look up how fast freight moves, how does that let you correctly time the next crash? It's not a lot to build a career on.

Hell, it's one thing to know about freight schedules, another thing to predict when the *market* will notice. It could crash tomorrow on bad first-quarter GDP numbers, or it might remain up until there are headlines about truckers unable to find work, or maybe it will take actual pictures of empty store shelves for the reality to sink in. And I certainly don't claim to know how badly the US will manage to drag the rest of the world economy down with it, which is why my money's in a mix of international stocks and international bonds, rather than simply one or the other.

What I can tell you is this: unfortunately, you can't assume surely *somebody* would do something about it, if there were a totally predictable crash incoming. Nobody else has as much of a financial interest in what happens to your savings as you do. Act accordingly.",454,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1kb4bkz/financial_professionals_mostly_arent_paid_to_care/,1745975532.0,TopherBrennan,1kb4bkz,not_advice_seeking

Personally, I am somewhere in the middle. I like to keep $100k of cash on hand at all times when we are at record highs, which includes my emergency fund and cushion for opportunities, or money available to pay down my mortgage if I so choose. 

During this bear market, I am taking advantage of the opportunity and deploying $10k blocks every 5% down in the S&P below 10% down. Since we are at 17% down now, I am down to $80k in reserves. I will continue adding all the way down. I won’t technically run out of money until we get to 55% down, which I don’t see happening. Once we rebound I will build those cash reserves back up most likely through my income and not selling.

A couple questions:

Will I owe capital gains taxes this year for receiving the account, even if I don’t withdraw?

Should I just leave it in MSFT and let it ride? I don’t follow MSFT and most of my other investing is in ETFs.

Just for example I have a Trad IRA and a ROTH IRA and both are very similar in builds. give or take 5-10% for the VOO/VTI combo. and between 3-5% for the smaller items. I know many overlap. But he wanted me to diversify by getting into emerging markets, commodities, and small cap growth. I have most of the money into VOO, with small amounts in the rest of the small stuff. I understand I probably have about 85% overlap besides the VXUS and the VXF. I am actually pausing investing until I pay off debt for the next 18 months. (Not getting any free money for a match) and as a 30 year old I have time. I obviously have the heavy tilt towards US Large Cap blend, but wondering if it's worth to diversify with emerging markets and commodities? I don't want to hedge bets while my portfolio can grow. I'm OK with transitioning more towards VTI rather than VOO. I'm also OK with buying more VXUS. But really don't want to sacrifice growth for something that won't grow much like commodities or emerging markets without some understanding from those who know more than me. (hence why I'm asking others) Please see below for the other ETFs I carry. Another problem with commodities is they have such a heavy expense ratio.

Edit: After looking at comments and talking with the financial planner (just the one time) I think I agree and have transitioned and raised my VXUS % to 15-20% between the two accounts, lowered the VOO and added into VTI. Removed the overlapping small funds and now have only QQQM, VTI, VOO, AVUV, and VXUS. One account only has 4 of those 5 with no AVUV. When/If VTI/VOO transitions away from tech it allows me to stay in tech with QQQM but I may transition that one as well.

investing,build emergency fund,50+ Times the resources in the Deep Sea? Could this be a multi trillion dollar sector soon?,"**America’s Deep-Sea Mining Push: Lockheed Martin Renews Seabed Licenses as TMC and MP Emerge as Strategic Leaders**

The United States is preparing to invest tens of billions in deep-sea mining as the Trump administration prioritizes rare earth minerals and energy security. Lockheed Martin’s renewal of its UK seabed mining licenses highlights growing defense interest in securing critical mineral supply. The International Seabed Authority estimates these ocean zones hold roughly 50 times more rare earth minerals than all known land reserves, making them central to future production.

As the US works to secure non-Chinese supply, exploration rights in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ) are key to strategy. **The Metals Company (TMC)** holds contracts covering 224,500 km² in the CCZ with estimated resources of 15.5 million tons of nickel and over 12 million tons of copper, cobalt, and manganese. **TMC** is developing advanced robotic systems to cut seabed disruption and CO₂ emissions by up to 90%, meeting tougher environmental standards to win approvals in multiple regions. Unlike traditional land-based mining, this approach avoids deforestation, large-scale excavation, and toxic tailings, offering a significantly lower environmental footprint while unlocking critical mineral resources.

Lockheed Martin’s renewed licenses show continued commitment to maintaining access and technology for defense-related mineral sourcing. Analysts see this as groundwork for future licensing, strategic partnerships, or government-backed offtake deals with operational players like **TMC**, which is positioned to scale production over 100 times its current pilot level with the right investment. Federal funding is expected to support domestic energy independence, advanced extraction, and expanded processing.

**MP Materials (MP)** is positioned to benefit alongside **TMC** as North America’s main rare earth processor with plans for domestic magnet production. Increased raw supply from deep-sea mining would drive demand for **MP**’s refining and manufacturing capabilities. As the US builds a secure, integrated supply chain free from foreign dependence, both **TMC**and **MP** are viewed as strategic assets supporting these goals.

Market projections suggest that with financing, government contracts, and offtake agreements, **TMC** could see significant valuation growth, with scenarios projecting multi-billion-dollar market cap potential. Lockheed Martin’s move to maintain seabed positions signals that major defense and industry players expect demand for these resources to rise as electrification, defense needs, and advanced manufacturing expand.

This combination of technology readiness, policy support, and strategic demand makes **TMC** and **MP** stand out for investors watching critical minerals. With Lockheed Martin signaling long-term interest and the US set to prioritize secure, non-Chinese supply chains, these companies are positioned at the forefront of America’s next resource shift.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1m0jb9f/50_times_the_resources_in_the_deep_sea_could_this/,1752589871.0,Anxious-Criticism652,1m0jb9f,not_advice_seeking
investing,build emergency fund,Four Stocks to Watch After Trump’s Critical Minerals Executive Order $MILIF $USAR $PPTA $UAMY,"On April 15, 2025, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that could reshape the U.S. mining sector. The order launches a federal investigation into the country’s heavy reliance on foreign sources for processed critical minerals—materials essential for everything from jet engines and missile systems to smartphones and electric vehicles.

The order comes amidst escalating tensions with China, which recently halted exports of several key rare earth elements. Trump’s move frames this dependency as a national security threat and calls for steps to rebuild and secure domestic supply chains.

As Washington pivots toward boosting U.S. production, certain mining and processing companies stand to benefit. Here are four to watch.

**Military Metals Corp. (OTCQB: MILIF)**:

Kicking off the list is **Military Metals Corp. (OTCQB: MILIF)**, a focused play on one of the lesser-known but increasingly vital critical minerals: antimony. As one of the few publicly traded companies dedicated almost entirely to antimony, MILIF is advancing multiple high-grade projects in politically stable jurisdictions, including the U.S. and the European Union.

Earlier this year, the company completed the acquisition of the 100%-owned Last Chance Antimony-Gold Property in Nevada. This historic site once supported U.S. defense efforts in the early 20th century. Located just 18 kilometers from Kinross’s Round Mountain mine, the property had seen little exploration since the 1980s. That is, until now. The company's team recently completed an initial site visit and is preparing for a full exploration program focused on antimony-rich quartz vein structures. Visible copper staining suggests potential for additional upside.

Internationally, **MILIF** is also making progress in Slovakia, where it controls two antimony-gold properties: Trojarová and Tiennesgrund. Trojarová, the company’s flagship asset in Europe, has seen over 14,000 meters of drilling and hundreds of channel samples from Soviet-era exploration. SLR Consulting (Canada) is now digitizing and interpreting the data to develop a modern mineral resource estimate. A LIDAR survey of the 1.7-kilometer underground workings was completed in early April and will guide future drilling.

Tiennesgrund is set for fieldwork starting in May. The property includes historical adits that produced high-grade antimony—reported at 18 to 24 percent—along with early signs of tungsten mineralization. MILIF plans to integrate decades of archived Slovak government data with new sampling and soil surveys to identify new targets.

All of this is unfolding amid rising antimony prices, which recently reached all-time highs near $60,000 per metric ton. Meanwhile, the White House’s decision to exempt antimony from new tariffs signals its importance to U.S. national interests.

**Military Metals Corp.** has also applied to the U.S. Defense Industrial Base Consortium, potentially opening doors for funding under the Defense Production Act—an invaluable capital source for a junior company.

“The exemption of these minerals from tariffs reinforces the urgent need to accelerate the development of secure, reliable supply chains,” said CEO Scott Eldridge. “It’s a clear signal that advancing domestic and allied sources is essential.”

With a focused commodity strategy, underexplored assets, and growing policy support across the Atlantic, **Military Metals Corp. (OTCQB: MILIF)** could be an early mover in the U.S. critical minerals market.

**USA Rare Earth, Inc. (Nasdaq: USAR)** is strategically positioned at the heart of America’s push for mineral independence. Directly aligned with President Trump’s executive order, USAR is building one of the country’s most comprehensive domestic supply chains for rare earth magnets—vital components in everything from electric vehicles and defense systems to wind turbines and smartphones.

The company controls mining rights to the Round Top deposit in West Texas, one of the largest known sources of heavy rare earth elements in the U.S. These include dysprosium and terbium—critical for high-performance magnets—as well as gallium, beryllium, and lithium—materials flagged as “strategic” by the U.S. government. In Stillwater, Oklahoma, USAR is constructing a 310,000-square-foot facility to manufacture sintered neodymium magnets. These magnets are used in electric motors, defense applications, and advanced technologies. USAR has also commissioned an Advanced Innovations Lab at the site, where it will prototype custom magnet designs and develop proprietary processes to bring production online by 2026.

“Our magnet facility sits at the center of the Trump Administration’s recent critical mineral executive order,” said CEO Joshua Ballard. “We’re open for business.”

USAR has strengthened its leadership team with the appointment of Rob Steele as Chief Financial Officer. With more than three decades of experience in finance and investment banking—raising $28 billion across fast-growing industries—Steele will play a key role in securing the capital needed for USAR’s expansion. “I strongly believe in USAR’s mission of returning the rare earth mineral and magnet supply chain to America,” Steele said.

With the escalating demand for high-tech manufacturing components and growing support from the federal government, USAR is well-positioned to become a key player in the U.S. critical minerals resurgence.

**Perpetua Resources Corp. (Nasdaq: PPTA) (TSX: PPTA)** is emerging as a significant player in the U.S. effort to secure domestic sources of strategic minerals. Through its flagship Stibnite Gold Project in central Idaho, the company is working to restore an abandoned mine site to produce both gold and the only mined source of antimony in the U.S.—a mineral vital to national defense and clean energy technologies.

The Stibnite Project is one of the highest-grade open-pit gold deposits in the country and is nearing a construction decision. The company recently secured a Final Record of Decision from the U.S. Forest Service, completed basic engineering, and started procurement for long-lead infrastructure items. It has also received significant financial backing, including a Letter of Interest for up to $1.8 billion in financing from the U.S. Export-Import Bank and over $70 million in Defense Production Act funding.

Antimony from Stibnite is considered essential by the Department of Defense for use in munitions and missile systems. With China, Russia, and Tajikistan currently controlling 90% of the global supply of mined antimony—China recently banned all exports to the U.S.—Perpetua’s project could supply up to 35% of domestic demand during its first six years of production, directly countering foreign dominance in the supply chain.

CEO Jon Cherry emphasized, “The Stibnite Gold Project is a prime example of why critical mineral production in America needs immediate attention.” With strong partnerships in place, Perpetua is aligned with both economic development and environmental restoration, making it a compelling long-term opportunity.

**United States Antimony Corporation (NYSE: UAMY)** is uniquely positioned to benefit from the growing push for domestic critical minerals production, particularly antimony. As one of the few vertically integrated antimony producers in the Western Hemisphere, UAMY is developing a full-cycle operation from mining to refining entirely within North America.

The company operates facilities in both the U.S. and Mexico, including its Montana base and the recently reactivated Madero smelter in Coahuila, which processes antimony concentrate into finished trioxide. UAMY is also advancing exploration at its properties in Alaska, where it controls nearly 9,000 acres of antimony and gold claims. Early sampling has revealed multiple high-grade surface targets, and fieldwork is already underway.

In 2023, UAMY grew revenue by 72% and tripled its gross profit while maintaining a clean balance sheet and increasing cash reserves to over $18 million. With smelting infrastructure online and concentrate shipments either delivered or en route, UAMY is poised to scale production through 2025.

Strategically, UAMY is part of several federal collaborations aimed at strengthening the U.S. supply chain for antimony-based materials—critical for both ammunition and flame retardants. As China continues to restrict exports of key minerals, UAMY’s importance is growing. With rising antimony prices and accelerating policy momentum, UAMY offers rare exposure to this strategically important critical mineral.

investing,build emergency fund,Rocket Lab (RKLB): A Promising Space Stock for the Post-Musk Era,"Elon Musk’s ventures have long dominated “space investing” conversations – but with Musk’s recent controversies and the fact that SpaceX isn’t publicly traded, investors are turning toward Rocket Lab as an attractive alternative. Rocket Lab (RKLB) is a \~$10–11B market cap space company that offers something SpaceX doesn’t: public market access to a growing space business, minus the Musk-related volatility. Let’s break down why RKLB might deserve a spot in a forward-looking portfolio:

* Robust Growth Trajectory: Rocket Lab’s financials showcase a company on the rise. 2024 revenues hit $436M (+78% YoY) , and Q4 alone grew 121% YoY. They’ve consistently increased launch count (16 launches in 2024 vs 10 in 2023) and expanded their Space Systems segment (which now brings in \~two-thirds of revenue via satellite manufacturing and components). Gross margins are improving (32% non-GAAP in 2024) , pointing to economies of scale. While the company is not net profitable yet (as it reinvests in growth), Wall Street expects continued top-line expansion and eventual operating leverage as larger projects come online .
* Catalysts on the Horizon: The big one is Neutron, Rocket Lab’s next-gen reusable rocket aimed at the medium-lift market. Management has scheduled the first launch for H2 2025 . This could be a game-changer – Neutron is designed to lift up to 13 tons to LEO , putting Rocket Lab in direct competition with SpaceX’s Falcon 9 for many satellite launch contracts. If successful, Neutron opens a much larger addressable market (national security launches, interplanetary missions, even crewed flights eventually). Investors are watching this closely; any positive development (engine tests, on-time construction) could boost the stock. In the meantime, Rocket Lab isn’t waiting around: they’ve signed new launch deals (e.g. an 8-launch contract with Japan’s iQPS just announced) , and they delivered on missions like launching 8 satellites for OroraTech with just 4 months’ turnaround , showcasing operational excellence.
* Government and Commercial Tailwinds: Unlike many space SPACs and startups that struggled, Rocket Lab has real customers and repeat business. Their backlog is \~$1.1B , split \~50/50 between government and commercial clients – providing diversification. Notably, Rocket Lab was selected for the U.S. Space Force’s NSSL Phase 3 (Lane 1) program , making them eligible for missions under a $5.6B launch contract umbrella alongside incumbents like SpaceX and ULA. They also hold a $515M contract with the Space Development Agency (SDA) to build missile-tracking satellite systems . These wins not only validate Rocket Lab’s technology in the eyes of key customers, but also ensure a baseline of revenue in coming years. In essence, Rocket Lab is aligning itself as a core player in future government space infrastructure – a recurring revenue stream that many “new space” companies lack.
* Musk Factor – or Lack Thereof: From an investing standpoint, one could argue that Musk has become a risk factor. Tesla’s own 10-K warned that the brand is tied to Musk’s reputation , and indeed we’ve seen political backlash contribute to Tesla’s sales slump and stock drop . SpaceX, while successful, is privately funded and also influenced by Musk’s persona (which might carry regulatory or public image risks, given his role in government and polarizing public statements). Rocket Lab provides a “Musk-free” exposure to the space sector. CEO Peter Beck is an engineer-executive who keeps a lower profile. There’s no cult of personality driving Rocket Lab’s valuation – which means less idiosyncratic risk. In fact, Rocket Lab’s shares are more directly correlated with its execution (launch success, contracts, revenue) than with any social media narrative. For an investor, that can be reassuring.

Valuation Considerations: After the recent pullback, RKLB trades at a more reasonable multiple relative to its growth. It had skyrocketed over 400% in the past year , but is now off highs. Analysts still see upside: Cantor Fitzgerald recently reaffirmed an Overweight with a $24 target , and other targets range up to $33 . Clearly, expectations are that Rocket Lab will continue to scale and eventually approach profitability as Neutron comes into service. Risks include execution delays (a short-seller argued Neutron could be late to 2026 , which would slow revenue growth) and competition (SpaceX’s dominance, emerging players like Blue Origin). However, Rocket Lab’s head start in small launch and established customer base give it a moat in its niche. Its enterprise value ($11B) is a fraction of SpaceX’s ($140B private valuation), so investors are essentially betting that Rocket Lab can capture even a small slice of SpaceX’s market share in the coming years – which would justify significant upside.

Conclusion: If you’re disillusioned with Musk or simply want a piece of the space sector’s growth, Rocket Lab is one of the most compelling options available. It combines the innovation of New Space with the accountability of a public company. As always, invest based on your due diligence (space is a risky industry), but RKLB offers a balanced risk-reward profile: solid current business, big future bets, and freedom from the Elon factor. For many, that’s an attractive proposition in 2025 and beyond.

I am proud of it and thought I would share here. While the guide is a lot more than just investing and so may not be ideal for this subreddit, I definitely think it hits some investing FAQs. 

For context, I am a 23 year old that became obsessed with personal finance at 17. I was able to hit a $100k net worth and 750 credit score at 22 prior to my peers' college graduation. Yes, I had some form of slight help from family, but I come from middle class and no money/inheritance was given to me. The point is not that I am some genius and successful. The point is that I learned some good advice online, actually followed a lot of it and want to share what I've learned. 

IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: The advice contained is simply what I personally know. 99% of it I learned as a 17 year old in high school. The financial institutions/products I mention are simply what I have used and thus recommend. I understand that the companies/funds/credit cards are not perfect and there may be better options. Do your own research. I understand that what has worked for me will not work for everyone.  I understand that there are a lot of other great or better ways to go about things. I don't claim this to be a perfect guide by any means. I am 23 and not a financial advisor. It's just a guide I made initially for my cousin. It's not that deep.

Guide TLDR: Live below your means, have an emergency fund, establish your credit safely and invest what you can in a Roth IRA. 

P.S. Sorry for any formatting issues. I copy and pasted this from a PDF version which is much easier to read and has a graph and a chart I made (DM me to get it - if that's easily possible)

5 Steps to Get Ahead in Your 20’s

\*The following steps are generally in order of importance. Ideally, you should have the previous step accomplished prior to later steps\*

Step #1 - General Bank Accounts

* ●  Open a checking and savings account with Capital One ○ Checking Account: “360 Checking” ○ Savings Account: “360 Performance Savings” (If names havechanged, make sure the account is a high yield saving’s account)
* ●  Along with the checking account, you will receive a debit card to be able to

make purchases in person with

* ○  You will also receive a checkbook with personal checks
* ○  For your debit card and checks, you can only spend what is in yourdebit card account

● Keep all of your savings in the savings account and keep $100-$500 in

your checking account  
○ When making a purchase with debit card or checks, transfer from

savings to checking  
● The savings account will usually generate 2% to 5% interest per year

which will be paid monthly  
○ Ex. If you have $10,000 in your savings, 3% would pay you $25

each month ($300 for the year = 3%)

Step #2 - Emergency Fund

* ●  Maintain 3-6 months of living expenses in a savings account
   * ○  Ex. $2,000/mo living expenses = $6,000-$12,000 minimum
   * ○  A minimum regardless of living expenses is $5,000
* ●  (RECOMMENDED) If you want to ensure you do not spend your emergency fund, open a second high interest savings account with a second bank, transfer the full emergency fund balance there and forget you have it!

■ I recommend CitiBank or Discover since I recommend their credit cards

Step #3 - Early Debt Pay Off  
\*Skip this step if you do not have bad debt or your debt interest rate is below 2%\*

● Determine if/how much you can pay extra towards your debt per month ○ I recommend 30% of your income to be for saving/investing (I

consider paying debt in the “investing” category  
■ If you have your emergency fund saved in full, you should put

30% of your income towards paying down bad debt  
● Set up automatic payments (or reminders if not possible) to pay extra

towards debts  
○ Ex. You have your emergency fund saved up and make $50,000/yr

after taxes. 30% of $50,000 is $15,000 to invest per year. You can set up an auto payment to pay an additional $1,250/mo towards your bad debt.

* ●  Examples of bad debt to pay off early include credit card debt, student loans and private loans/payday loans
* ●  When you have debt, you are losing money to negative interest. If you are able to pay that debt off and then invest the money you were paying towards the debt, you not only are no longer losing money to negative interest, but you are gaining money from positive interest

○ Ex. You are paying $300/mo towards credit card debt. $150/mo of that money is towards the interest. After you save and pay off that debt early, you now invest that $300 into

Step #4 - Credit Card

\*Skip this step if you are not disciplined with finances and may spend more than you have\*

* ●  Open a “Discover It Secured Card” with Discover Bank ○ You will be required to put down a deposit which you will receive in7-10 months so long as you pay all payments ○ You cannot spend more than your deposit so I recommend a depositof $500-$1,000 ○ Connect your general savings account and set up an auto paymentto pay off the full balance every month ○ Subscribe to email notifications and manually pay off your accountevery time you get an email that your new statement is ready inaddition to the auto-pay
* ●  Use the credit card for all possible purchases to get cash back (2% on gasand restaurants, 1% on everything else)
   * ○  To be safe and not spend more than you have in your savings,always check your savings account prior to making a purchase tomake sure you have enough money
   * ○  NEVER SPEND MORE THAN YOU HAVE IN YOUR SAVINGS
* ●  After 7-10 months, you will receive your full deposit bank and your card limit will increase from that amount to a higher amount

○ As a bonus, go into the discover app and request a higher limit every 6-12 months

■ Based on your income, monthly expenses and job, the bank may give you a higher limit, which can improve your credit score

● With a secured card you can establish/improve your credit score ○ A breakdown of credit score is included later in this guide

Step #5 - Roth IRA Investment Account

\*You can only invest in a roth if your income is below the maximum requirement ($160k in 2024) and you are investing taxed income (you must have a job and it cannot be cash under the table)\*

* ●  Create an account with Fidelity and open a “Roth IRA”
* ●  Determine the maximum amount you can invest each month based onyour income
   * ○  I recommend 30% of your income to be saved and invested (If youare not saving for a large purchase or your emergency fund, the full30% should be invested)
   * ○  $7,000 is the current annual maximum for a ROTH IRA (2024)($583/mo)
* ●  Connect your general savings account and set up automatic investing to purchase two different mutual funds or ETFs every month
   * ○  75% of the monthly investment should purchase FXAIX or “Fidelity 500 Index Fund” (S&P 500 / the US Stock Market)
   * ○  25% of the monthly investment should purchase FSPSX or “Fidelity International Index Fund” (the International Stock Market outside of the US)

■ Make sure that dividends are reinvested automatically  
○ Ex. Each month $400 is transferred from your general savings account with Capital one. $300 is invested into the US Stock Market (Fidelity 500 Index fund) and $100 is invested into the International Stock Market (Fidelity International Index Fund)

* ●  Never ever withdraw funds from this account or any other investment account if possible (unless retired or for dire emergency after emergency fund is empty)
* ●  Stick to investing in low cost Mutual Funds or ETFs (the funds mentioned above). Investing in individual stocks can result in a better investment, however usually investing in a large fund that represents many companies (such as the entire US stock market or international market) will be the safer bet that nearly ensures you will get a solid return over time
   * ○  Investing in individual stocks is gambling
   * ○  Investing looking to make money in the short term (less than 10years out) is not investing. It is trading. Trading is gambling.

Bonus Steps for your 20’s:

1. If your employer offers a 401k match, always take it and invest the maximum match amount

* ○  This is more important/better than your Roth IRA and if you cannot do both, do the 401k match instead of the Roth
* ○  If you can do both, invest the full 401K match and then invest the remainder of your investment funds into your Roth IRA2. Additional credit cards
* 2.   If you are very responsible with credit cards, will never spend morethan you have, and always pay them off each month in addition to autopay, you can receive some better benefits with more cards■ 2nd Card - Citi Double Cash: 2% back on everything ■ 3rd Card - Citi Custom Cash: 5% back on one category ofchoice (I do gas personally)
* ○  If you are an independent contractor or business owner, designate acredit card for all of your business expenses (so you can easily trackexpenses for write offs)
* ○  I never recommend getting any credit card that has an annual fee

Additional Steps for your 30’s

\*Move on to these steps in your 20’s if you can\*

1. Hire a financial advisor  
If you make enough to where you can invest more than the Roth IRA annual maximum, you should hire a financial advisor  
Make sure they are a fiduciary advisor  
A cheap option is to hire them only for flat fee based financial planning (general guidance instead of them doing the investing for you)

2. Start investing in bond funds  
Change your automatic investments in your Roth IRA so that your stock allocation is 120 minus your age

* Ex. 30 year old is 120 - 30 = 90% stocks 10% Bonds
* Ex. 50 year old is 120 - 50 = 70% stocks 10% Bonds With your new bond allocation %, set up your auto investment to purchase FXNAX or “Fidelity U.S. Bond Index Fund” Every 5 years, adjust the automatic investment to align with the 120 minus your age rule

3. If you can afford to invest more than the Roth annual limit, contribute more to your 401K

○ OR other great options include:

* HSA: Pre and Post Tax Investment account that can only bespent towards healthcare and medical costs (Tax benefits ofROTH IRA and 401K combined)
* 529 College Savings Plan: Post tax investment account (likeRoth IRA) that must be spent on a family member’s education costs (use to save for kid’s college)4. Save up for and purchase a home
* ○  While still contributing to your investment accounts, start settingaside funds monthly to save up to purchase a home
* ○  Use your emergency second savings account or a 3rd savingsaccount so that you don’t accidentally spend the money

Saving Tips

Saving is, in my opinion, the most important aspect to one’s financial health. You must save to establish your emergency fund. You cannot pay off debt without saving the money to pay it. You cannot safely use a credit card without having savings. You cannot invest without saving that money first.

Living below your means can allow you to have less stress in your life, choose a lower paying, but more enjoyable career path, spend money on “the big important things”, afford to cover emergency costs, pay for incredible experiences, retire at a reasonable/early age and actually afford to raise children.

As of 2024, 56% of Americans do not have savings to cover a $1,000 emergency (per CNBC and FOX). For many young people, in my eyes, making money isn’t the issue. It’s actually saving money. Saving money is very simple. However, it’s also very hard at the same time. If you spend less than you make, you will save money. We all know that, however, what makes it so difficult is the emotional side of it. You have to get out of your comfort zone and make changes to the way you think if you want to change your spending habits into saving habits.

Tactical Tips:  
Before you buy anything, ask yourself if you actually need it - You were

living before, weren’t you?

Wait to Buy Something - Impulse purchases are deadly. If you really want it that bad, you will still want it a week or month from now. The bigger the purchase, the longer you should wait.

Have a spending account and a savings account - Only make payments out of your checking account and only transfer from your savings when you need to. An even better method is to open a second high yield savings account with another bank. Then you can put your savings there and forget about the money. That way you can keep your spending money in your general savings account and collect interest on both saving and spending funds.

Don’t Window Shop - Window shopping can be a fun way to pass time, however if you are going into a store without the intention to buy a specific item you need, every single thing you end up buying is unnecessary. Or if you need a specific item, go straight to that item and straight to the register. Don’t browse!

Review your Expenses - Simply take 5 minutes to review your bank or credit card statements once a month. You might be shocked at how much you are actually spending. You might also find old subscriptions you can cancel.

Set up an automatic savings transfer from your spending account to your savings account - If possible, time this with your paycheck deposit. Just like with an automatic transfer to your investment account, you can just forget you have the money and you never even see it! You don’t miss the taxes taken out of your paycheck so you want to have the same setup with your saving/investing.

Mental Shifts to Tell Yourself Before you Spend Money:

“Stop using material things to fight insecurity” - Everyone wants nicer cars, homes, clothes, the list goes on. Why? Mostly because of status. We put our own value in our material possessions. Be that confident 70 year old that wears what’s comfy, drives an old, reliable car, and lives in a quaint, outdated home. Don’t wait until you’re old to realize what’s really important. Work on that now.

“The little things add up” - $2 here, $5 there, $13 here. Next thing you know, your credit card statement is $800.

“Would I rather this small thing now or this big thing later?” - Would you rather an expensive gym membership or would you rather a second vacation each year? Would you rather go out to dinner and drinks every week or would you rather be able to save up and buy a house?

“How many hours/shifts of work does this cost?” - Is buying that dinner worth it if it cost you an entire day’s work? Is spending an hour of work worth buying your lunch out vs bringing it from home? Is an expensive vacation worth 2 months of hard work or should you go the cheaper route? This also works great for commission jobs. How many cars/apartments/ect. would I have to sell to buy this?

“Saving is a tax free way of “making” money” - You can either work to make $130 and get $100 after taxes or you can just save the $100.

“What is more important to me, having nicer things or being stress free financially?” - Is that second vacation worth the stress of running up a credit card you cannot pay off? Is that daily starbucks coffee worth the stress of paying rent late? Is that nicer car worth the stress of not being able to afford to move out of your parents?

“If I invested this money today instead of spending it, I would have X when I’m older” - Use a compound interest calculator to understand generally how much your money will grow until retirement. When you are a 20 year old, each dollar you invest now should grow about 20 times itself by age 65 (10 times itself as a 30 year old). If you are 20, ask yourself if you want to spend $1,000 on something you don’t need now or have $20,000 to spend on something when you are older.

“I’m stealing money from the future me/family” - What do you value more, the novel item you don’t need right now or something you care more about in the future? Would you rather drive a nicer car now or would you rather be able to vacation every year after you retire? Would you rather spend money on yourself now or your family in the future?

“Instead of buying this every day/week/month, I invested it, how much would I have later?” - How much money could you invest if you downgraded from a $100 gym membership to a $20 membership? How much money could you invest if you got a car with a $300 monthly payment instead of $500? How much could you invest if you split rent with a roommate to pay $1,000/mo instead of $1,800. Someone who buys a $6 coffee five days a week could instead invest that $30 per week to have over $350,000 extra at retirement.

If you like to gamble/buy scratch tickets: “Do I want an impossible chance to have $100,000 today or do I want an almost guaranteed $100,000 in 30 years” - A 30 year old who spends $20 per week on scratch tickets will very likely never win big even if their habit continues for life. However, if that person invested that $20/week starting at age 30, they would likely have $113,000 at 60.

Brief Guide to a 750 Credit Score

A credit score is extremely important, however it’s something that there is a lot of confusion about. While many know what a credit score generally is, most don’t know all of the factors that determine the score and thus how they maintain a high score.

First off, a credit score or “FICO” score is how businesses and financial institutions like banks determine how qualified you are for certain services. Your credit score will be a factor in determining not only if you can get a loan for things like a car, house, ect. but also can determine what your interest rate will be on that loan. You also can be required to have a credit score to finance purchases like appliances and furniture or very commonly in order to rent an apartment. The higher your credit score, the higher the likelihood that a landlord will let you rent their apartment and later on, the cheaper your car and home will be.

Building a good credit score can take a very long time, however ruining your credit score can happen in an instant and can often take many years to repair. The easiest and most common way to lower your credit score is by missing a payment. This is why it is so crucial that you have autopay setup on all of your loan payments and credit cards.

If you have a bad credit score, you may find yourself unable to rent an apartment, buy a home, or buy a car. This is because you are seen as risky and untrustworthy. If your score is fair but not good, you will find yourself paying high interest rates. Because of this, you want to maintain a score above 700.

Credit Scores are typically seen as follows:

300 - 579 = POOR  
580 - 669 = FAIR  
670 - 739 = GOOD  
740 - 799 = VERY GOOD 800 - 850 = EXCELLENT

When it comes to apartments, you generally need to fall into “good” or better to rent. In order to get the best interest rates on loans for cars/homes you generally need to fall into the “Very good” category or better.

Credit scores are determined by the following categories below. The percentage represents how much this category makes up a score and so a higher percentage means a more important category.

Payment History - 35%  
Credit Utilization Rate / Amounts Owed - 30% Length of Credit History - 15%  
New Credit Opened - 10%  
Credit Mix - 10%

What each category means and how to do well in each:

Payment History - How often have you made payments on time?

1. Never miss a payment. Set up autopay AND manually pay off monthly.
2. Open cards sooner. The longer a card has been on your history the morerecorded payments on your history.
3. Have more cards/loans. The more lines of credit, the more on timepayments. Don’t close card accounts for this reason.

\*If you do miss a payment, #2 and #3 help. Having many total payments makes your percentage of late payments smaller.\*

Ex. If you have one credit card for 10 months and miss one payment, you’re late 10% of the time. If you have 5 credit cards for 5 years and miss one payment, you’re only late 2% of the time (1/10 vs 1/60)

Credit Utilization Rate / Amounts Owed - How much of your total credit limit are you spending? (credit cards) / How much do you owe? (Loans)

1. Pay off your cards in advance of the statement date. Manually or with autopay, pay most or all of your current balances so that the balance is very low compared to your limit. Ex. If your limit is $1,000 and you have a $900 balance, your utilization rate on that card is 90%. If you pay $850 of the balance before the statement period ends, the statement balance will be only $50 which is just 5% of your limit.
2. Have more credit cards. The more cards, the higher your total limit. This is another reason why you should not close a credit card.
3. Ask for limit increases. You can easily do this right in your banking app or call from a phone. Income, expenses, and credit score will determine the increase
4. For amounts owed, you really can only pay off debt. Save money so you can pay it off ahead of time. Don’t just make minimum payments.

Length of Credit History - How long is your average line of credit?

1. Open up lines earlier in life. If you know you will get a certain credit cardeventually, get it now.
2. Be smart about timing of new lines. When possible, do not acquire newlines of credit prior to a life event that requires good credit.
3. Have more lines. When you open a new line of credit it does not affect you as much with more lines since that line represents a smaller percentage ofthe total amount of lines. Ex. A second credit card is 50% of your lines, however a 10th line of credit is only 10% of your lines.

New Credit Opened - How recently have you opened a line of credit? 1. Follow the same first two tips above for “Length of Credit History”

Credit Mix - Is the mixture of types of lines of credit diverse?  
1. Have different types of lines of credit. There's mainly revolving (credit

cards) vs installment (loans). Ex. It’s better to have a mortgage, car loan and two credit cards rather than just 4 credit cards

Payment history is the most important by far and so it’s crucial to stay on top of all lines of credit and ensure payments are being made and made on time. If there is an accident and a payment is not made or made late you can actually call your creditor and potentially have them remove the late payment.

Keep in mind that you should never make bad financial decisions in order to increase your credit score. You also don’t want to complicate your finances. With one or two lines of credit, you can easily get a good score after just a couple years of on time payments.

Credit should not be taken lightly. If you are not financially responsible, do NOT get a credit card. The benefits are not worth the consequences of bad credit or even worse, snowballing credit card debt.

Compound Interest Explained (Why you Should Invest)

Saving is necessary in order to invest, however investing is much more powerful. When you invest, you are paid a percentage yield.  
In other words, your money grows. But the beautiful thing about the growth is that it is not linear. It is exponential.

A simplified example of this can be with a high yield savings account and $100. Let’s say the savings account has an annual yield of 5%. That means after one year, the savings account would have given you $5. However, in year 2, you do not get $5. Why? Because you are no longer being paid 5% of $100, you are being paid 5% of $105. 5% of $105 is $5.25. The next year you are paid 5% of $110.25 which is $5.51. Each year you are paid more and more because the interest compounds on top of itself. Compounding interest!

Saving on the other hand, is linear. Fortunately, high yield savings accounts do have compound interest, however the annual yield is typically much much lower than stocks and checking accounts don’t have any interest at all. If you were to save $100 every month, rather than investing it, it would look like the blue line on the chart above. However if you invested it, the growth would compound on top of itself and look like the red line.

  

Example - A $5,000 one time investment at 7% interest per year:  
\*The first number is the new amount and the second number is the amount gained in the 5 years\* Year 5 - $7,012 (+$2,012)  
Year 10 - $9,835 (+$2,823)  
Year 15 - $13,795 (+$3,959)  
Year 20 - $19,348 (+$5,553)  
Year 25 - $27,137 (+$7,788)  
Year 30 - $38,061 (+$10,924)

In the first 5 years, the $5000 would grow an additional $2,012. However in just the final 5 years (from year 25 to 30), the investment would grow an additional $10,924. That is over double the original $5,000 alone! Compound interest!!

If you contribute $7,000 annually to a Roth IRA from age 20 to 65, with an average annual yield of 7%, you would have approximately $2,140,262.34 by the time you reach age 65. Tax Free! (\*7% is a decent inflation adjusted estimate of growth based on investing in the US Stock Market\*)

Because of the fact that compound interest gets better and better the longer it works, the earlier you start investing the better. Not just better, but much better. The downsides of starting later are also exponential (same math but backwards).

Example - $5,000 invested per year at 7% interest per year: (at different ages) \*The amount next to the age is the total amount the fund would grow to by age 65\*  
18 Years Old - $1,881,579.00  
20 Years Old - $1,633,771.07

25 Years Old - $1,142,920.14 30 Years Old - $792,950.21 40 Years Old - $365,519.51 50 Years Old - $148,235.43

Each year matters a lot. The difference between starting at 18 and 20 years old is $253,808 even though you would only invest $14,000 in those two years at 18 and 19. Start as early as possible! Even if it's only $100 a year.

By the way, if you start saving $5,000 a year at 18 instead of investing it, you would only have $235,000 instead of $1,881,579. Don’t just save!

Roth IRA vs. Traditional IRA (401k)

Roth IRA taxes income but not stock growth (“Post tax”)  
Standard IRA (401k) taxes stock growth but not income (“Pre tax”)

When you are young, your income is usually low, but the investments you make will grow a lot by the time you retire. You want the low income to be taxed and not the high stock growth.

When you are older, your income is usually higher and since your investments do not have as much time to grow until retirement, the growth is low. You want the low stock growth to be taxed and not the high income. In conclusion, when you are in your 20’s and 30’s it is generally better to invest your money in a Roth IRA

\*remember that if your employer offers a 401k match, invest the maximum amount that will be matched by the company and invest the remaining money you can into a Roth IRA - The match is better than the tax savings of a Roth\*

Example #1 - Roth IRA

Income: $50,000  
Age: 25 (40 Years of Stock Growth to Retirement) Amount Invested that Year: $5,000  
Amount at Retirement: $74,872

Example #2 - 401k

Income: $100,000  
Age: 50 (15 Years of Stock Growth to Retirement) Amount Invested that Year: $7,000  
Amount at Retirement: $19,313

In example #1, you want to be taxed on the $50,000 income and not the \~$70,000 of tax growth. In example #2, you want to be taxed on the \~$12,000 of stock growth and not the $100,000 of income.

I’ve thankfully secured a contracting gig that pays hourly but no retirement benefits.  Should I roll the 401k into an IRA somewhere (if so, any recs on best companies to look at) or leave it be? 

Should I contribute to a Roth and Traditional IRA with income from my contracting role? Any advice appreciated! ",16,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1et9ws7/recently_laid_off_next_best_steps_for_continuing/,1723764687.0,Huskydreamlife,1et9ws7,advice_seeking
investing,saving for retirement,Is it still worth investing if you know you might not make it to retirement...,"Hey all,

Quick background for everyone. 

Male  
37 years old  
Married 

base Salary: 150k/yr

Currently invests in: 12% 401k contribution + 6% match && 3% employee stock purchase program && maxed out Roth IRA && 600.00 monthly deposit into vanguard ETF. 

On track to retire comfortably.

Typical month he may have anywhere between 1k to 3k after bills and expenses. He's just stockpiling it into a HYSA and thinking about increasing contributions to 401k and vangaurd.

2025: He now has stage 5 Kidney Failure. Currently on dialysis and active on transplant list. 

He is still working full time at the moment and doesn't plan to stop until he has to. 

Doctors have said with dialysis he can live very comfortably into old age. (60s 70s) there's transplant expected in 5 to 6 years but life expectancy of a deceased donor kidney is 5 to 15 years because he is still young. If he gets a transplant at 43 he will need another transplant at 58 to 64.... with another transplant that might last until he's 74 or less because of older age not to mention future health issues.

  
My question: If this were you in this situation, would you be increasing your contributions preparing for the best life after 65 or would you reduce to only 401k match (6%), stop maxing ROTH, and invest into something shorter term to enjoy life now? 

This person lives well below his means, so his salary is comfortable for him, but knowing he may not enjoy years and years of retirement, it seems like the better choice to spend more now then save for later while quality of life is still high in his younger years.

If anyone has any input or similar stories I'd love to hear them 

  
Thanks

investing,50/30/20 rule,50 Rules Every Stock Investor Should Know,"Some investing rules are timeless,

Here are 50 of them:

1. If you buy for a reason and the reason is no longer valid, then sell.
2. Don’t blame your mistakes on the market.
3. If you get on the wrong train, get off at the nearest station, the longer it takes you to get off, the more expensive the return trip will be.
4. The difference between playing the stock market and the horses is that one of the horses must win.
5. Predicting rain doesn’t count, building the ark does.
6. When a sector is hot, you can be sure the big firms will create a fund that specializes in that area - not because it’s good for your financial future, but because it’s easy to sell.
7. Who does not own shares when their prices drop, will not own shares when their prices soar.
8. Hype stocks are a tax for people who don’t understand fundamentals.
9. The market is not efficient, but it’s still tough to beat.
10. Don’t play all the time.
11. Don’t let your opinion on what should happen bias your investing strategy.
12. Investing should be done with disposable income. Not with income you need.
13. Experience is knowledge. Everything else is information.
14. The account that is left alone for the most part is one that will likely perform best.
15. Cash is not trash. It’s an option on finding value in the future.
16. In the short-term, the crowd if more often wrong than right. In the long-term, the crowd is more often right than wrong.
17. Dividends are an elegant value indicator as they favor companies that at least make a profit.
18. Your portfolio should not be exposed to risk, but instead to opportunities.
19. Don’t invest in a leveraged company. Instead, use leverage to invest in an unleveraged one.
20. Optimism and pessimism have no place in the market. The big money is made by realists.
21. Keep it simple is the catchphrase of a good model.
22. When everybody likes a stock, it must go down. When nobody likes a stock, it may go up.
23. Investing is a probabilities game, not a certainties game.
24. More stocks double than go to zero.
25. In a bull market, be bullish. 
26. Never own a stock if the corporate title includes “Universal”, “Global”, or “Intergalactic”.
27. If all the economists in the world were laid end to end, they wouldn’t reach a conclusion.
28. Trying to bet on the next best thing is not investing, it’s gambling.
29. No matter how big and scary some news sound, we’ve almost always been through something similar before.
30. Consider the range of likely outcomes and then form forward-looking expectations based on probabilities.
31. Learn market history and use it as a laboratory to understand the range of reasonable expectations.
32. An economist is a guy who is fascinated with numbers but who doesn’t have enough personality to become an accountant.
33. You’ll never know all the answers.
34. Investing should be more like watching paint dry or watching grass grow. If you want excitement, take $800 and go to Las Vegas.
35. Buy when you see value because it’s unlikely that you will time the bottom.
36. Look out for announcements of growth initiatives.
37. Investing is a game in which time works as an asset rather than a liability. Most peoples plans, when you add time, get worse. What you wanna do is play games where you wait you win.
38. A dull company name should get your attention. No one takes “John’s Tasty Fruits” serious - until it’s too late and the price is up.
39. At major turning points in markets, market prognosticators are generally wrong.
40. Most people who are lucky enough to sell something before it goes down get so busy patting themselves on the back they forget to buy it back.
41. When markets are falling, the potential for future appreciation in stocks generally increases.
42. Invest in companies whose products or services are regarded as irreplaceable by their customers.
43. Really good businesses usually don't need to borrow.
44. The years say what the days can't tell.
45. Investors often assume when a decision is followed by a good outcome, the decision was good, which isn't always true.
46. Investing is kind of a game of connecting the dots. The nice thing about it is the longer you are in the business, as long as you are intellectually curious, your collection of data points gets bigger and bigger.
47. Often investors invent a thesis to justify a trend.
48. The best long-term margin of safety comes not from an investment’s price but from the value of a company’s competitive advantage.
49. Find outstanding businesses at sensible prices, not a mediocre business at a bargain price.
50. Time arbitrage is one of the biggest behavioral advantages anyone can really have.

investing,50/30/20 rule,Will the sentiment around Trump & his tariffs affect Tesla’s stock specifically?,"\[Update\]: This got kicked by the Automods and I had a hard time getting it allowed. It’s a little stale now, especially with things changing so fast, but I would still like to have the conversation.

I posted something on another sub that one of members of this community suggested would be better received here. So, I decided to give it shot with this one. I get that this is ""TLDR"" for most people so if you are not into that, let me jump right to the question for you:

Will the negative sentiment around Trump and the impacts of his new tariffs translate to any meaningful negative sentiment around Tesla's stock enough to make it *specifically* diverge from the rest of the Mag 7 (bearish)? Or will Elon have escaped yet again using the astronomical power of his ERDF (bullish)?

\---------------------------------------

For those looking for something to read, here you go:

Obviously: Tariffs. Pain. Global pain.

Here is a great interview with the well-respected economist [David Rosenberg](https://www.rosenbergresearch.com/david-rosenberg/): [Economist David Rosenberg on Trump admin: ""These people don't understand what a tariff is](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/submit/)""

For those who do not want to watch the whole video, here is the TLDW summary:

1. The Trump administration used 3-grade pumpkin math to determine what they are calling ""reciprocal tariffs"".

1. Side note- As an American and former ice hockey player that has spent time in Canada, I have to say- I friggin' love Canadian's humor. This guy starts out with a sarcastic jab of ""*somebody out there cracked the code*"". Blahaha! Sending good vibes to my friends up North. Keep your chins up friends.

1. \*People have been ""numb"" to the nonsense coming out of the Trump administration and were ignoring it. Not anymore- This is key to the question I am about to postulate.\*

1. The short-covering rally we just had was totally ignoring future uncertainty. More uncertainty was not priced in and that is what we just got. And surely, more uncertainty is coming. Hence the negative market reaction.

1. Uncertainty negatively affects expectations. And markets trade on expectations. Uncertainty alone can knock off 1-2% of GDP (which has been modeled and proven). This factor alone can lead to zero growth and drive us into a recession.

1. Only ""sycophants"" (maybe we should just call then ""psychopants"" instead) think tariffs are going to work in the way they are being presented. They will surely be inflationary. Exporters do not pay tariffs, the importer does (us).

1. Tariffs are not sustainable. Especially for America. The last price shock from the pandemic saw price shocks feed into wages. This is not the case anymore and the ""little guy"" will just get screwed here. Again. We will just lose jobs and pay higher prices.

1. America is a consumer-based economy (\~70%). We don't manufacture much of anything. We just buy it. We spend money like there is ""no tomorrow"". When the consumers hunker down our economy will contract. We are screwing ourselves.

1. The McKinley tariffs, like all long-standing tariffs, are recessionary drivers in the long run. If this is known by the administration and just being used as a strong-arming negotiation tactic, this likely (hopefully) a temporary situation (months or years- your guess is as good as mine).

1. Americans have short attention spans and election cycles. Manufacturing and business have very long time-cycles and lots of patience. Nobody is going to do anything until the dust settles.

1. Tax cuts are going to be tough to pull off now with the conflicting fiscal policy.

1. Retaliation is coming. This is more uncertainty. This will cause more market volatility.

1. Rosenberg thinks we are heading for a recession that is not priced in because we have been able to avoid it and stave off bear markets the last two times. The selloff is ""half done"" in his view.

One thing I will add: Tariffs will surely cause inflation. Trump can't bully companies into eating the losses. And inflation is not going to help the Fed lower rates. Higher rates really screw companies that need to borrow a lot of money and with it, their profits, share price, and the markets in which they are traded. Lowering rates was priced in. Raising rates was not. This seems to be flying directly in the face of one of Trump's openly stated economic objectives. These contradictory actions are only adding to the uncertainty around this administration’s haphazard policy plans, or rather, lack thereof.

I started writing out points from my perspective as an engineer with over 20-years of design, development, and manufacturing experience in America but decided to delete it before I get slammed with more ""TLDR"" comments. Nobody has cared for decades and nobody cares now. It became a rant out of frustration from seeing the slow death of manufacturing in America and rampant rise in consumerism and the dangers that poses to our economy and nation as a whole. I will just share this: There is nothing I would love to see more than manufacturing return to my beloved country. Not only do I think the current actions from this administration will fail to accomplish that, I fully expect that it will have the exact opposite effect in the long run. From my direct industry experience, I foresee these tariffs and the haphazard manner in which they are being rolled out as being far more likely to be of great benefit to China in both the near term and long run. Not America.

Back to item #3 above. Most of the world has been tuned out to what is going on in the political theater here in America. It has just been a clown show of chainsaw wielding theatrics for the most part. But as of yesterday, shit just got very real for the entire globe. While Elon has certainly become the human lightning rod for the politically motivated people around the world, for the most part, nobody else has cared. Neither has Wall Street, as most analysts and institutional buyers are looking at Tesla as a buying opportunity right now. Any potential brand destruction has been largely ignored and merely commented on as a ""possibility"" that can be managed. I realize this perspective might anger the Elon haters but I am just trying to be objective here. Look at this chart of the Magnificent 7 (Mag 7) over the last 6-months:

6-Month Mag 7 Chart- Normalized by % gain/loss (Tesla in blue): [https://imgur.com/a/c5lHWxR](https://imgur.com/a/c5lHWxR) (\*a lot has changed in the three days since I made this chart/post).

While the political activists are cheering that Tesla stock has fallen greatly from its recent highs, my take is different. Yes, the ""Trump Bump"" has been erased. But when you normalize it on percent gain/loss, Tesla has just settled right back in with the Mag 7. In fact, Tesla is the only one of the Mag 7 stocks not in the red over the last 6-month period. It's doing the best out of the whole group. I am viewing this as a big shoulder shrug and ""meh"" from the markets. No harm, no foul as they say. The market might not see the short-term tailwinds from any benefits of being a close ally and key member of the Trump team anymore but that seems to be about it. Most importantly, despite the endless slew of terrible news and consistently poor fundamental performance, that has long predated the most recent political turmoil ([missed expectations the last 9 out of 10 quarters by double digits](https://fortune.com/2025/01/30/top-tesla-earnings-takeaways-stock-completely-divorced-fundamentals-earnings-revenue-profit-elon-musk/)), the markets definitely aren't pricing in any possible negative effects from Elon's political involvement either (just like the tariffs). Other than a brief (and huge) positive divergence and return to normal, Tesla has not seen any *real* damage to its share price in comparison to the Mag 7. It's been a net zero move for Elon and Tesla (at the moment). I am just being objective here, don't get mad at me if you are mad at Elon!

I know all the Elon and Tesla fan club members are going to jump in and say something like: ""*But Elon is selling the future of the world. The Robotaxi and Optimus robot are what the company is being valued on right now. Cathy Wood says Tesla will be at $2,600/share in just a few years!*"" The discussion on that vaporware nonsense is a huge topic and not something I am looking to get into here. Fact: There are already self-driving taxis on the road (Waymo/Google) and there has already been a humanoid robot assistant developed by a major car company (ASIMO/Honda). Nobody has cared about either development or product launch so nobody should care about Elon's much delayed and cobbled together versions of the same thing. It's all just a theatrical diversion from the failing car company known as ""Tesler"". And like it or not, as of today, Tesla is *just a car company*. Nothing else is for sale. But you can buy the stock and hype all you want. It's all just part of the ""Elon Reality Distortion Field"" (ERDF).

Let's be more specific, Tesla is just a car company that derives more than half its income from things that have nothing to do with its cars (that aren't selling), and which it cannot control the future of, both of which are very volatile. More than half of Tesla's reported profits are also derived from vapor, in the form of [carbon credits](https://carboncredits.com/teslas-carbon-credit-revenue-soars-to-2-76-billion-amid-profit-drop/) and [crypto](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/29/tesla-reports-600-million-profit-boon-from-digital-assets-rule-change.html). Trump is already doing away with [$20B in funding from through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF)](https://carboncredits.com/trumps-epa-cancels-20-billion-in-climate-funding-greenhouse-gas-reduction-fund-what-it-means-for-clean-energy/). How long until Tesla loses its carbon credits? Again, more contradiction and uncertainty. Trump can't support Tesla while simultaneously dismantling government funding and support of green initiatives as he as promised his voters that he would do.

\*Prediction- Trump will make some positive remarks about being friendly to crypto right before Tesla's upcoming earnings call to give his buddy Elon a bump. Be ready.

For the sake of this discussion, let's take the fan club perspective and paint the rosiest picture possible. Let's say Elon (finally) delivers everything he has promised for years (which he won't). Both his taxi and robot are consumer products, just the cars Tesla makes. Recent sales show that there is already real brand destruction going on with Tesla vehicle sales, especially outside of America. The gamble seems to be that Elon and his team think the world is just a bunch of stupid goldfish that will just forget about all his recent antics and fringe political craziness and go back to buying his junk cars that fall apart when left outside. Or possibly, love him even more for all he has done for the ""little people"" of the world (not seeing it myself).

If there is real and lasting brand destruction here, why wouldn't consumers (Tesla's *only customer* both currently and in the future) boycott Elon's taxis and robots just like his cars? Why wouldn't the same logic and risk factors apply to future products and company valuation and why aren't they being applied to the company *right now*? It seems logical to me that if Tesla's vehicle sales are declining due to poor consumer sentiment around the brand, his future products would follow the same trend. This is not priced in by anyone. Literally, not one single analyst or intuitional investor has applied this logic. Behold the power of the ERDF.

I must also mention the following, because it is really important to keep in mind: There is sentiment around Tesla the brand and sentiment around Tesla the stock. Those two things have had nothing to do with each other (or reality) in the past. The only way the stock prices moves is by buying or selling to stock. No matter how mad people might be at Elon, if they weren't holding shares before, they can't do anything about the company's stock price. Protests do not directly cause stock prices to move. And this is not an election. The number of people out there despising (or loving) Elon and Tesla has nothing to do with the stock price unless they are buying or selling shares. It only takes a few massive institutional investors and a loyal fan club to prop up the stock or even send it higher. Tesla's stock is roughly split 50/50 between the two and of you haven't read the reports, retail investors are [going bonkers over Tesla](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-21/tesla-s-retail-fanboys-buy-the-stock-at-a-pace-never-seen-before?embedded-checkout=true). Keep your eye out for when institutional investors report at the end of this month. One Swedish firm just [closed their entire position](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/swedish-insurer-folksam-divests-tesla-070431340.html) with Tesla. More may follow.

If there is one truism everyone should keep in mind it is this: Don't mess with people's money. Even if you aren't into politics, or even you love Trump and the right-winged groups Elon has been supporting around the globe, getting kicked in the wallet isn't going to make anyone happy. Nobody is going to be spared here. The global markets are f'ed right now. And with it, most people's money. Even for people that aren't in the markets, real jobs are getting destroyed everywhere right now. Elon himself is driving up unemployment by orchestrating mass firings in the government with his DOGE. That effort alone has resulted in hundreds of thousands of jobs being suddenly lost (and counting). While it might not make much of an overall difference, those people had retirement accounts that fed into the markets. The people being put out of work certainly aren't going to be spending like there is ""no tomorrow"" or putting money into the markets anymore. The people being put out of jobs in other countries because of these tariffs won't be putting money into the markets either. Between the government job cuts and tariff induced cuts, this is not going to be a small number of people being put out of work all at once. With prices of just about everything going up real soon, it's just going to make things worse. Again, we have contradictory initiatives rolling out at the same time from this administration. It's like ripping off a Band-Aid and then cutting yourself all over again at the same time.

Tesla is Elon and Elon is Tesla. The brand is inseparable from the man himself. While most people didn't care about the bullshit happening in America (even many Americans themselves), they have certainly had a rude awakening the last couple days. Trump is an elected president and world leader. Elon is not. Not coincidentally, Elon timed his ""departure"" from the Trump team right before the tariffs were imposed. And Elon is not really leaving his role (you all already know this). But in the media, he is stepping away and returning to his many roles with his many companies. Sneaking out the back door before the building burns down might be good enough for the markets to keep on believing in Tesla.

The questions now become: Is Elon that easily separable from Trump? And are we all really just a bunch of dumb goldfish? Will everyone be pumped to jump into a Robotaxi if they are really launched in a few months? Because that seems to be what is priced in to Tesla's stock. In the eyes of the world, which are now watching their retirement accounts gets decimated, jobs cut, and prices for everything to soon be rising, will Elon remain tethered to Trump? Specifically, as it pertains to investing, will negative sentiment around Trump and the impacts of his new tariffs translate to any meaningful negative sentiment around Tesla's *stock* enough to make it *specifically* diverge from the rest of the Mag 7 (bearish)? Or will Elon have escaped yet again using the astronomical power of his ERDF (bullish)?

Let's be more specific, Tesla is just a car company that derives more than half its income from things that have nothing to do with its cars (that aren't selling), and which it cannot control the future of, both of which are very volatile. More than half of Tesla's reported profits are also derived from vapor, in the form of [carbon credits](https://carboncredits.com/teslas-carbon-credit-revenue-soars-to-2-76-billion-amid-profit-drop/) and [crypto](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/29/tesla-reports-600-million-profit-boon-from-digital-assets-rule-change.html). Trump is already doing away with [$20B in funding from through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF)](https://carboncredits.com/trumps-epa-cancels-20-billion-in-climate-funding-greenhouse-gas-reduction-fund-what-it-means-for-clean-energy/). How long until Tesla loses its carbon credits? Again, more contradiction and uncertainty. Trump can't support Tesla while simultaneously dismantling government funding and support of green initiatives as he as promised voters that he would do. He will have to pick between his voters and Elon soon enough. 

\*Prediction- Trump will make some positive remarks about being friendly to crypto right before Tesla's upcoming earnings call to give his buddy Elon a bump. Be ready.   

For the sake of this discussion, let's take the fan club perspective and paint the most rosy picture possible. Let's say Elon (finally) delivers everything he has promised for years (which he won't). Both his taxi and robot are consumer products, just the the cars Tesla makes. Recent sales show that there is already real brand destruction going on with Tesla vehicle sales, especially outside of America. The gamble seems to be that Elon and his team think the world is just a bunch of stupid goldfish that will just forget about all his recent antics and fringe political craziness and go back to buying his junk cars that fall apart when left outside. Or possibly, love him even more for all he has done for the ""little people"" of the world (not seeing it myself). But if there is real lasting brand destruction here, why wouldn't consumers, Tesla's *only customer* both currently and in the future, boycott Elon's taxis and robots just like his cars? Why wouldn't the same logic and risk factors apply to future products and company valuation and why aren't they being applied to the company *right now*? It seems logical to me that if Tesla's vehicle sales are declining due to poor consumer sentiment around the brand, his future products would follow the same trend. This is not priced in by anyone. Literally, not one single analyst or intuitional investor has applied this logic. Behold the power of the ERDF.  

I must also mention the following, because it is really important to keep in mind: There is sentiment around Tesla the brand and sentiment around Tesla the stock. Those two things have had nothing to do with each other (or reality) in the past. The only way the stock prices moves is by buying or selling to stock. No matter how mad people might be at Elon, if they weren't holding shares before, they can't do anything about the company's stock price. Protests do not directly cause stock prices to move. And this is not an election. The number of people out there despising (or loving) Elon and Tesla has nothing to do with the stock price unless they are buying or selling shares. It only takes a few massive institutional investors and a loyal fan club to prop up the stock or even send it higher. Tesla's stock is roughly split 50/50 between the two and of you haven't read the reports, retail investors are [going bonkers over Tesla](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-21/tesla-s-retail-fanboys-buy-the-stock-at-a-pace-never-seen-before?embedded-checkout=true). Keep your eye out for when institutional investors report at the end of this month. One Swedish firm just [closed their entire position](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/swedish-insurer-folksam-divests-tesla-070431340.html) with Tesla. More may follow. 

If there is one truism everyone should keep in mind it is this: Don't mess with people's money. Even if you aren't into politics, or even you love Trump and the right-winged groups Elon has been supporting around the globe, getting kicked in the wallet isn't going to make anyone happy. Nobody is going to be spared here. The global markets are f'ed right now. And with it, most people's money. Even for people that aren't in the markets, real jobs are getting destroyed everywhere right now. Elon himself is driving up unemployment by orchestrating mass firings in the government with his DOGE. That effort alone has resulted in hundreds of thousands of jobs being suddenly lost- and counting. While it might not make much of an overall difference, those people had retirement accounts that fed into the markets. The people being put out of work certainly aren't going to be spending like there is ""no tomorrow"" or putting money into the markets anymore. The people being put out of jobs in other countries because of these tariffs won't be putting money into the markets either. Between the government job cuts and tariff induced cuts, this is not going to be a small number of people being put out of work all at once. With prices of just about everything going up real soon, it's just going to make things worse. Again, we have contradictory initiatives rolling out at the same time from this administration. It's like ripping off a bandaid and then cutting yourself all over again at the same time. 

Tesla is Elon and Elon is Tesla. The brand is inseparable from the man himself. While most people didn't care about the bullshit happening in America (even many Americans themselves), they have certainly had a rude awakening the last couple days. Trump is an elected president and world leader. Elon is not. Not coincidentally, Elon timed his ""departure"" from the Trump team right before the tariffs were imposed. And Elon is not really leaving his role (you all already know this). But in the media, he is stepping away and returning to his many roles with his many companies. Sneaking out the back door before the building burns down might be good enough for the markets to keep on believing in Tesla. 

The questions now become: Is Elon that easily separable from Trump? And are we all really just a bunch of dumb goldfish? Will everyone be pumped to jump into a Robotaxi if they are really launched in a few months? Because that seems to be what is priced in to Tesla's stock. In the eyes of the world, which are now watching their retirement accounts gets decimated, jobs cut, and prices for everything to soon be rising, will Elon remain tethered to Trump? Specifically, as it pertains to investing, will negative sentiment around Trump and the impacts of his new tariffs translate to any meaningful negative sentiment around Tesla's *stock* enough to make it *specifically* diverge from the rest of the Mag 7 (bearish)? Or will Elon have escaped yet again using the astronomical power of his ERDF (bullish)?

investing,50/30/20 rule,Outset Medical - Is there a prospect?,"Introduction and declaration
This is an interesting stock to talk about. Here I will try my best to report facts rather than opinion, and try to come up with a relatively objective summary of this company – Outset Medical (OM)

Background
End-stage renal failure patients, they will require dialysis in long-term unless they undergo renal transplantation. Traditional hemodialysis machines are complicated to use, and home dialysis is possible but not easy to achieve. OM produces a new dialysis machine called Tablo, that appears to be efficient and easy to use. In a small but randomised study, the treatment efficacy was demonstrated in 99.5% of In-Centre and 98% of In-Home treatment sessions (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7027451/). Their Tablo home dialysis program was shown to have a 90-day retention rate of above 90%, compared to 65% of the usual home dialysis device (https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-outset-medical-reports-robust-q3-2024-results-raises-guidance-93CH-3709548).

Three hits in a row
Outset Medical had a good start with a stock price of $40-60 from Sept 2020 to April 2022. Subsequently, OM has experienced three hits in a row. First is back in early 2022, they submitted for changes in their originally approved Tablo system. They failed to obtain the approval promptly and had to put their shipment on hold in June 2022 (https://investors.outsetmedical.com/news-releases/news-release-details/outset-medical-announces-shipment-hold-new-tablo-systems-home). There was a decline in revenue and the stock price dropped from around $40 in April 2022 to $15-20 in August 2022. In August 2022, OM received FDA 510 clearance and resumed shipment of the Tablo machine.

Second, OM received an FDA warning letter in July 2023 (https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/warning-letters/outset-medical-inc-656485-07052023). FDA found certain materials on the company’s website that promote continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), which is a modality outside of the current indications for the Tablo Hemodialysis System. The FDA also asserted that the TabloCart with Prefiltration requires prior 510(k) clearance for marketing authorization, and yet OM was already selling it. The TabloCart is an optional accessory that you used to transport the machine which included a water filter. For non-medical person, it is more or less like a furniture dolly that you use to transport the machine. As a result, the stock price dropped from $20 in July 2023 to around $3 in Oct 2023. 

Third, they had an FDA recall of the Tablo machine due to contamination found in the tubings in April 2024 (https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfres/res.cfm?id=206601). Although in May 2024, they received FDA approval for the TabloCart (https://investors.outsetmedical.com/news-releases/news-release-details/outset-medicals-tablocart-prefiltration-receives-fda-510k), their sales and revenue were affected due to both the FDA warning letter and the FDA recall of the Tablo machine. As a result, OM implemented two workforce reduction plans in both late 2023 and May 2024. Upon release of the earnings report of Q2 2024 which was fairly disappointing (https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/earnings-call-outset-medical-reports-disappointing-earnings-in-secondquarter-93CH-3562579), the stock price dropped again from around $3 in August 2024 to lowest $0.5 in Sept 2024.

OM is on the edge of failing
With a stock price of < $1, there are really two major concerns from an investor’s point of view. First, how is OM’s financial status. Is their cashflow good enough for them to ramp up and drive revenue. They basically need to find ways to raise fund in order to survive and ramp up their marketing forces after settling all FDA-related issues. Second, OM faced a risk of being delisted from the stock market. This notification is triggered as the closing bid price of OM’s common stock remained below $1 for 30 consecutive trading days. OM has been given an initial period of 180 days, until March 24, 2025, to regain compliance with Nasdaq's minimum bid price rule. To achieve this, the company's stock must close at $1.00 or higher for at least 10 consecutive trading days before the deadline (https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/outset-medical-faces-nasdaq-delisting-over-share-price-93CH-3637185). At this point, everyone believes OM is going to fail.

Are we going to see a turning point for OM? 
We have seen a number of interesting events since Q4 2024. First, OM stock’s price slowly increased from $0.5 to highest up to $1.4 on 3rd Jan 2025. They were able to achieve a closing bid of more than 10 trading days in late Dec 2024, so theoretically they are able to regain compliance with Nasdaq’s requirement temporarily.

Second, on 6th January 2025, OM accounced that they have secured a $169M private funding and a $100M 5-year term loan (https://investors.outsetmedical.com/news-releases/news-release-details/outset-medical-announces-169-million-private-placement-financing). The company expects to have approximately $210 million in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments with $100 million in debt. This means OM should have sufficient funding for ramping up marketing and sales in 2025. On the other hand, the 169M funding is used to purchase 843,908 shares of its Series A Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock at a price of $200.00 per share, and each share of Series A Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock will automatically convert to 250 shares of common stock. So basically, each common stock was sold at a discount price of around $0.8. Therefore, following the announcement, the stock price dropped from $1.4 (3rd Jan 2025) to around $0.8 for the rest of Jan 2025. This reimposes the concern on whether they will receive another notification of possible delisting from the stock market.
Third, OM announced the resolution of FDA warning on 13th Feb 2025 (https://investors.outsetmedical.com/news-releases/news-release-details/outset-medical-announces-resolution-warning-letter). This appears to be a significant milestone that can boost up marketing and sales. Also, as their TabloCart got FDA clearance back in May 2024, seems their products are currently ready for a full-scale commercialisation. Following the announcement, the stock price had a 10% rise from around $0.8 on 13th Feb 2025 to $0.9 on 14th Feb 2025. 

Will OM have a future in 2025? (Largely personal opinion)
I hope I am able to give you the whole story of OM. The obstacles that they have faced and the measures that they have taken to overcome the challenges. A big assumption is that their Tablo and TabloCarts are ready for full-scale marketing and commercialisation. Personally, I think they do because FDA do not take this lightly. The resolution letter from the FDA is a strong support. In the coming few months, it will be important to see if the stock price can get above $1.0 in order to remain compliant to public listing requirements.

Now it is about growth. If you have time, you can look into the earning reports from 2022 to 2024. In a nutshell, they experienced initial growth from 2022 to 2023, but then experienced a decline since the FDA warning letter in July 2023. The whole year of 2024 had a decline when compared to what they have achieved before the FDA warning. With the FDA clearance and resolution recently, it appears that it will be quite easy and logical for OM to develop significant growth in the year of 2025. Both the product revenue and recurring revenue (from Tablo cartridges and services) are expected to grow in 2025. Recurring revenue appears to be quite significant - once you purchase the machine, it is likely that you will continue to purchase the consumables given a >90% of retention rate. The next earning report will be on 19th Feb 2025, so stay tuned.

Second is about revenue. OM is obviously losing money right now. With the recent investment, the company claims that “Based on our current projections, the funds from this financing are expected to capitalize the company through cashflow breakeven”. Realistically, this money should be sufficient to run the company for at least 18 to 24 months. Currently they are experiencing an increase in gross margin from around 20% in early 2023 to latest 36.4% in Q3 2024. OM claimed to be on track to achieve a gross margin of 50% but we will have to wait and see. I am not able to find any actual projections from the company. For Q3 2024 (https://investors.outsetmedical.com/news-releases/news-release-details/outset-medical-reports-third-quarter-2024-financial-results), OM had a gross profit of 9.8M and a net loss of 27.9M. Among the expenses, 8.1M was used for R&D. So just by a brief calculation, their product revenue has to increase by 2 times in order to break even and start having revenue. According to their Q3 2024 earnings report, they have installed nearly 6000 consoles in hundreds of facilities, with tens of thousands of nurses and thousands of physicians being trained. 2025 will be an important year to see if OM can reach that turning point in which Tablo can become the mainstream of dialysis across the nation. It will also be interesting to find out if their gross margin really improves further – in that case it will be much easier to start earning money. 

Conclusions
After a careful investigation of the company, I am actually quite impressed how OM was able to overcome all the obstacles for 2023 and 2024. Given such a low stock price and the recent funding, I am relatively comfortable to invest on OM in the coming 18-24 months. In fact, I think OM will only experience growth in 2025 given such a poor performance in 2024 and their recent clearance and resolution of all regulatory issues. Without a doubt, it is certainly a high-risk investment! But I guess high risk can also mean high return.",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1irknzc/outset_medical_is_there_a_prospect/,1739801404.0,Zanix311,1irknzc,advice_seeking

Here's my situation:

* I’m 40, married, with two young sons.
* I have about €400k in SPY (S&P 500) and a stable monthly income.
* My current apartment is worth €250-300k, with a mortgage of €80k (€700/month). If I rented it out, I could get around €2k/month.
* A bigger home for my family would cost at least €600k, maybe even €1M for something new.
* My dad and sister are struggling with a combined mortgage of €380k. My dad is retiring in six months, and my sister doesn’t earn enough to cover the payments.

Now I’m torn between three options:

1. **Pay off their mortgage** – Help my family by clearing their debt, but it might mean postponing my own financial goals.
2. **Buy a bigger house for my family** – Give my kids more space and stability, but take on a much bigger mortgage.
3. **Keep everything in SPY** – Let compound interest work for the long term, but feel guilty for not addressing immediate needs.

I’ve already made some big mistakes in the past, like losing €180k on risky investments, so I’m trying to make the smartest move this time.

The equity is an intentional discount by the owner. 10% currently should cost 600k minimum he is okay to do it for 300k 

However I need the funding if i was to do this and it would require me to go all in on this.

I’m thinking if i did this I would need to discuss terms for a dividend based on equity as I would need the cash flow to pay down borrowed debt to make this purchase.

I’m a Wife, and a Mom of an almost 2 year old. My Husband and I come from families that have no generational wealth and our parents have little education themselves- both families are somewhat distant one way or another from their family of origin, and my Husband and I both grew up in abusive/neglectful households with substances involved (I know these details seem pointless but I feel like I need to emphasize this because we both so badly want more for ourselves and our future generations; maybe this isn’t the right sub for this- and please direct me somewhere better if you feel like it would help). My point being- we lack guidance, and knowledge on even where to begin. 

We bought our first home at 19 and 20 years old. We’ve been here now almost 6 years. Originally our plan was to be here 5 and have the means to move to a bigger, nicer home/neighborhood. Time has since came and gone and we’re in a much different place than originally anticipated ( life right🤦🏻‍♀️). 

Becoming parents has really fed the desire for growth- in all aspects; mentally, emotionally, physically, financially- I don’t know where to start. 
 
We work 40+ hours a week and live close to paycheck to paycheck despite making a little over 80k between the two of us annually. We don’t want to live this way forever; let alone work until the day we die to get by while missing out on so much life has to offer.

Bills monthly:

mortgage $800,
car payment $650,
car insurance: $380,
Health insurance: $400,
Gym: $25,
Netflix: $17,
Internet: $80,
Phone: $100,
Electric: $170,
Water/trash: $115,
Credit cards: $140 (between the two),
Grocery: $500,

We also have a decent amount of medical debt.. 

Some of these I aimed a little high on just because things fluctuate obviously. 

But- my question remains:

What’s your best advice? I’m open to any and all criticism- good and bad. 

I’ve been thinking about possibly getting into property investments such as Airbnb’s and short term rentals of the like.

I’ve read into wills, and trusts some- but there’s so much information to consume it’s hard to keep up😅

I want to feel secure though; and I really need help. I appreciate any and all the advice- and even if you don’t have any, you just taking the time to read🫶🏻

investing,credit card debt,Need advice. Dave Ramsey way of investing. ,"Wife and I are 32 with $130k+ in our retirement plan. We have followed the Dave Ramsey way of investing for the last eight years. 

That means all of our retirement funds are in mutual funds, 529s or my company 401k. We use credit cards, but don’t have any debt and we haven’t been paying extra toward the house since our mortgage rate is less than 3%.

I see many people here talk about index funds and managing their own retirement investing buying the same funds I see all the time. 

I’m worried that we jumped into one way of investing too early and haven’t done the math to see if it’s worth doing ourselves or going a different route.

Has anyone been in the boat? What did you decide to do? Did you stay the course or change your strategy?

investing,credit card debt,Im doomy and interested in your opinions.,"Hey guys,  

I’ve been reading up on the economy and markets lately, and honestly, it’s kinda freaking me out. The U.S. stock market is hitting crazy highs, but it feels like we’re walking on thin ice. I wanted to throw this out here and see what you all think. Are we heading for a big crash or what?  

### **Is the U.S. Market in a Bubble?**  
The S&P 500 looks sus right now. Big Tech is carrying the market, valuations are insane, and the Fed’s been hiking rates for over a year. What happens if this thing finally cracks?  

Like, could it be:  
- **Tech Hype Collapsing**? What if all this AI stuff is just another bubble like 2000?  
- **Debt Problems**? Companies are drowning in debt and now have to refinance at way higher rates. Do we start seeing defaults?  
- **Consumer Burnout**? People are maxing out credit cards, savings are gone, and inflation isn’t totally fixed. Does spending just drop off a cliff?  

Or am I just overthinking it, and the U.S. market will somehow dodge disaster again?  

### ** What About Global Markets?**  
If the U.S. tanks, does everyone else go down too?  
- **Emerging Markets**: Places like India and Vietnam are growing like crazy, but do they hold up if investors freak out and pull their money out?  
- **Japan**: Everyone’s saying Japan is the underdog. Is this finally its time to shine, or does it just get dragged down like everyone else?  
- **Europe**: They’ve already been struggling with energy problems and slow growth. Could they get hit even worse than the U.S.?

401k: 164k (employer matches this 50%) 

Stocks: ~142k across mostly ETFs

I have a fully funded emergency fund and no debt. Which brings me to a couple of questions: 

1) should I be investing in a backdoor Roth? I feel like investing over 30k/year (with employer match) is plenty and that I want to invest the rest in other avenues so I can access it pre-retirement but is that wrong? 

2) I get caught up on what percentage should be long-term vs. short term saving

3) I currently use Wealthfront because I like their UI but I prefer Schwab as a company and already have an account there as I receive my RSUs through them. Is there an easy way to transfer my entire portfolio from Wealthfront to Schwab without selling/rebuying everything?

Loans are officially going to enter repayment mode this November, but are gathering interest anyway since they are Grad Plus and Unsubsidized government loans.

I have no other debt other than a mortgage at 3.125% so I am making just the minimum monthly payment on that.

investing,student loan help,Help a poor grad student make lunch money in passive income? ,"Hello all. I am new here and I have no idea what I'm doing. 

I'm a perpetual student - that being said, I'm almost 30 and I'm working on my final degree, in a field that doesn't pay very well, at an institution that is railing against giving student workers a living wage of any kind. Read: I'm old now, and I'm still poor. I come from a family who is also now old and relatively poor, i.e. won't put their $ into a high-yield savings because they're so anxious to move $ around, desperately afraid of losing anything that no risk is acceptable.

I have some savings from undergrad that I've blown through a considerable amount of paying bills in graduate school. I've been paying off my private undergraduate debt at a 5.6% interest rate consistently over the last 8 years - to the point where I've paid the loan ""off"" twice already, but of course interest is a thing, so I've finally reached the point where the interest gets paid on a monthly basis and I'm slowly but steadily eating into the principal. Making my payments each month, I should have the biggest loan paid off by mid-2030s, and the federal ones are just gonna do what they do (on in-school deferment for now, but I'm hoping the government is gonna do SOMETHING). 

  
I NEED to stop blowing through my savings, and I'd love my money to make me some money each month to help offset the cost of bills and help me not have sleep for dinner all the time. It's currently all sitting in a HPY long-term savings account with minimal withdrawals, earning about 4.4% in interest that gets paid out monthly. 

  
Now, 4.4% is pretty good I imagine, and it's bringing me in a hundred or two hundred bucks each month, but I'm not sure if diversifying my investments might help create longer term financial stability? I don't really have any more than $20 invested in actual stocks, which I got into on Robinhood (lol I know), back when the big Dogecoin craze went down and I was thrilled to have made $30 off of that. 

Some context: my situation is a little unique in that I am employed by the institution at which I am doing my thesis, but they structure our contract in such a way that we have extremely minimal protection and minimal financial opportunities. I do not have access to retirement plans/401k/IRAs etc through my job, nor do I have access to life insurance, financial advising, etc. I'd like to grow the $ as much as possible but I am nervous to put a LOT of it into something that would render it non-fluid in case there is an emergency I need to cover, etc. 

School me on what I can do better? Are there any stocks I \*should\* be investing in? Is there something I'm missing? Is there better yield than 4.4% out there on savings in some sort of program I don't know about?",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1fkogay/help_a_poor_grad_student_make_lunch_money_in/,1726761776.0,HoxGeneQueen,1fkogay,advice_seeking

investing,student loan help,Quick question regarding markets and debt.,"In the near future my wife and I will be gaining a lump sum of about 400k. We owe 200k on our house and our mortgage is 2k a month. 

Would it be more wise to pay off the house and invest the rest of the money into mutual funds, making 2k a month payments into the mutual funds, or to just invest all 400k and keep the mortgage?

If we pay off the mortgage our only debt will be student loans (two vehicles both new and both paid off) and normal miscellaneous things. 

We are both in our forties. My wife has recently gone back to school, however I am the only one currently working. She will be done with school in the next year-and-a-half and should be making approximately 120k a year in the healthcare field when she is done. I hate having a mortgage but don’t know if now with everything going on it’s a good time to invest.

First post here, after starting a new job with a 50% pay increase (late 2022) and actually being able to save/invest a decent amount I'd like a bit of advice with what i should be invested in. 

STATS
-34y/o supporting a stay at home wife and young child with another on the way

INCOME
-130-150k gross pay from main job depending on overtime
-5k from military reserves
-20k from military disability (tax free)

INVESTMENTS
-401k 95k (mix of traditional and roth) 85k Invested in fidelity lifecyle fund 2060 and 10k in company stock. Was able to max this out this past year
-70k in TSP roth 100% in C fund, just recently switched to this, was lifecycle fund
-My Roth IRA 30k have been maxing out past couple years, Wealthfront, most aggressive(10) but a mix of stock, international, real estate, bonds
-Wife's Roth IRA 20k have been maxing out past couple years, also wealthfront, and slightly less agressive, similar mix
-After tax investment account 7k, Started this in 2024, have recently upped contribution to 1k a month. 100% FXAIX
-529 5k, through fidelity and similar to lifecycle fund, cant remember what it is called. Have not been contributing to this recently. Will have 30 months of college through military GI bill to split between both kids. And may contribute slightly more to this, they will have help from grandparents too
-HYSA/emergency fund 16k

LIABILITIES
- my car, owe about 6k at 6%, plan on paying this off lump sum soon with wife's inheritance of about 15k
-wife's student loans about 10k ranging from 3-6% will pay off this year with inheritance
-house, 140k left on loan at 2.5%, worth about 400k. Was paying this off early in loan (2018) but now know extra money gains more in the stock market.

QUESTIONS/NOTES
I finally feel like I'm starting to make headway in investments due to contributing more from newish job and starting to educate myself more, I intend to continue maxing out 401k and both mine and wife's Roth IRAs in the coming years. I am not eligible for a HSA due to having insurance through military.
- i feel as though I may be missing out on potential gains by having funds invested in lifecycle funds and not index funds. Would you agree with this attitude? Not sure of the diversification I should have across the board through out all of my investments and have thinking about moving our IRAs and my 401ks into index funds. I am ok with being more aggressive.
- I do a mix of both roth and traditional for my 401k, I am in a non-income tax state. Would you lean more towards one or the other in my current situation?
-do you have any suggestions or changes you would make to what I posted above? Any more information you need? Also just looking for general advice.

investing,student loan help,"9.2 million people delinquent on student loans, 90 day reporting starting","I don’t see many in the investing world talking about this.

Delinquency credit reports are landing for 9.2 million people (**43% of Americans with payments due**), due to hitting the 90 day mark of missed payments since late 2024’s resume of credit reporting on federal student loans.  

Why is this important? Student loans are dispersed by semester, not consolidated. While 1 payment is typically made, it’s spread out to 8+ loans. Missing 1 payment (as 9.2 million, 43% have now done) shows up on credit reports as 8+ missed payments, **tanking credit scores by 130-250 points overnight** (I personally know someone who just lost 200). 

You can see stories gaining traction on here of those home/car shopping, only to see this credit hit. Does this effectively remove or significantly hinder 9 million from the borrowing economy? The effect may be 2 fold, with this being the first time those borrowers actually have to start sending $ to those loans. 

Tried adding news link but couldn’t. 

Edit: this just accounts for past due. Those currently due (another 13 million people) could follow suit when they become delinquent ",1627,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1jddt5n/92_million_people_delinquent_on_student_loans_90/,1742221355.0,cybersuitcase,1jddt5n,not_advice_seeking
investing,student loan help,I talked with a Chinese factory owner to see what’s happening on the ground. TL;DR: China has mobilized tons of resources to exporters but there’s some signs of pain,"I’m an American in China but have been seeing very little foreign reporting about what’s happening in China, which is weird to me because it seems pretty important to get a clear picture of the trade war. So here’s what I learned from him.

**Gov support**

-The local government is helping and giving him low interest rate loans / short term financial support. This type of thing is very common throughout China right now - lots of local govs are mobilizing to support exporters thru the tariff war. Li Qiang, central gov minister, says central government help is probably coming too 

-Guangzhou, and I assume others too, has also organized tons of seminars since Liberation Day with buyers from Europe, Latin America, and Asia. A big source of replacement demand for his factory has been from these

-He’s getting lots of buyers from TikTok shops overseas. It seems like TikTok is helping a lot to mitigate the demand impact 

-The news story of Walmart, Target, Costco, etc. resuming some orders is true, he confirmed it. But the amounts are **very, very** small

**Pain**

-He’s already re-evaluating employees and firing some soon. He said most exporters in Guangzhou are cutting some employees, but extremely US dependent exporters have furloughed most of their workforces until mid May

**Some good news for the U.S?**

-Before Liberation Day he was building a factory in the US and has now fully committed to it. But it’s having issues since the raw materials are sourced from China and they’re getting hit with tariffs

[The full interview is here](https://www.yaphete.com/p/live-from-the-trade-war-2-chinas), I didn’t write everything here.

Only management receives an employer match, so I won’t receive that right now. 

I also try to keep in mind that I will have a pension after 30 years. Current guys that’s I talk to who are getting ready to retire estimate that their pension alone is about $5,000 a month, and your spouse gets half of that too. So pensions look like $7,500 a month, if you’re married. 

I want to be smart about my future but It’s also difficult with everything being so expensive, and trying to buy a house. So when I see $275 deducted from every check, plus taxes/union dues/pension dues ($1,300+); it can be frustrating.

I used some funds to buy a couple pieces of raw land in my area, including a lot on the beach near me.  

As I get older I am starting to think more long term.  My wife has a healthy amount invested in the stock markets and is doing well.  I want to diversify and go a different direction.  

The plan is to spend about $500k to build a house on the land, for an all in at around $700k.  The property will be short term rental that should net 30-35k per year after expenses.  And should be valued at $800-900k when complete at current market value.  Going to use about $300k of cash to build and take $200k loan, which should equal about $2500 per month payment.  To me this makes sense because I can use the rest of my cash in my business, while securing a solid real estate asset.

investing,ready to buy a house,How to manage margin like a fortune 500 company.,"Wise use of margin is no different than a company taking out a wise loan as capital to expand business. Same concept, same risks, measured the same way at different scale.  
  
I think margin management is one of the key ways to get ahead. The largest use case for margin:

* To buy something when it's at a good price before you sell something you intend to sell

Why is that the largest use case? I call it ""differential"". Let's say something rallied to a high of 100, and something else rallied to a low of 50. That's a $50 differential.

But what if while waiting for the $100 to happen, the $50 goes to $70? Now you only have a differential of $30.

Using margin MAKES SENSE when you are certain to sell something for something else, but want to buy the something else when the target differential is your target maximum.

If the target doesn't work out, you still will sell the winning stock anyway.

Another use case for margin is leverage:

* A lot of people think of margin as only for leverage, and it is, but I think more importantly margin should be serviceable.
* For instance if a monthly payment is $1000 on your margin debt you should be able to service that payment. Otherwise there's no reason to be leveraged.
* This margin payment is just a cost of capital, like a business, and there's standards that S&P 500 companies use to manage cost of capital and so you should adopt those. For instance a 2x revenues in reserve of cash for economic down turns.
* Therefore if you have \~$50,000 in margin deployed you should have $100,000 in reserve buying power. ***NOT IN EQUITY BUT IN BUYING POWER***.
* You need the reserve in buying power in case of economic downturn.

Leveraging bottoms:

* The only time I crank up my margin is in market bottoms where the risk to downside becomes much less and I'm well hedged. Then you can put on much more margin if you're comfortable, just like taking out a loan to buy a cheap house. Only the house's price swings much worse and so the ""foreclosure"" aka margin call can happen much worse.
* But it makes sense to margin a bottom only because most people are long biased and the market is long biased over time. If you keep your margin serviceable (see above) then you can survive the downturn while paying down the margin and improving your debt ratio.

These basics make margin a fairly useful tool. But I just want to emphasize that the most useful tool is using it to buy something you intend to pay for with a sale, but are not ready to sell, but the buy is ready to buy.

That use case alone has made me a LOT of money.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1mci211/how_to_manage_margin_like_a_fortune_500_company/,1753810788.0,Standard-Sample3642,1mci211,not_advice_seeking

investing,ready to buy a house,Where does an uneducated fella start?,"Sorry for the vague title question but here’s my situation. I’m 31 years old and never invested seriously. I got into it several years ago but I didn’t have the mindset of holding for a long time, I sold everything as soon as I felt like I needed the money. I looked at it more like gambling on short term growth. My knowledge is in home renovations and that’s where 90% of my effort goes, trying to buy as many busted up houses as I can in my town. 

I know I need to invest but at this phase of my life, I have no interest in learning all the technicals involved in the stock market. Everything I read says S&P500 is the safe bet. Never exciting growth but almost always growth to some degree. When I looked at buying a share I had the option of S&P500, S&P500 growth and S&P500 value. It looked to me like the growth option was just a slightly riskier but better performing option. I chose the growth option. 

Would an uneducated investor be wise to put their extra money into this passively until they’re ready to learn more and get more diverse? Is focusing all my investing money into one stock option a horrible idea? If so, where does this uneducated fella start?

investing,ready to buy a house,23F Investment Journey Starting,"Hi everyone! For a little background: I am a 23F and just graduated from college. I am currently in a master’s program to become a teacher. I have $25,000 in my savings account that only has 3.5% APY. I currently rent an apartment and work as a substitute teacher, so some income but not a ton. 

I am wanting to begin investing to make some more money. I don’t know much about good CD rates or good Savings Account rates so that’s one question that I have. But I also wanted to potentially get into buying and selling shares and stocks and things like that. But, I just don’t know how the process works. I know you normally get an app like Fidelity then buy shares of things you’re interested in. Then the market fluctuates all the time and you either gain or lose money. But what do you do after that? Do you hold it long enough to make some money then sell all your shares and pull out of the stock market completely? Is that a wise thing to do? Because I know you have to pay capital gains taxes on any income. How does taxation work with investing? Or do you sell some shares and immediately re-invest that money that you made into other shares so you don’t ever really pull out of the stock market until you’re really ready to? 

I’m genuinely just trying to make some money and save up for a down payment on a house and a new car someday. I just want to know the best ways to do that!!

investing,buy vs rent,Renting/Investing in ETFS VS Buying Home - Any Regrets?,"Hi,

TL;DR: For anyone who’ve opted to not purchase a home and instead invested near equally into ETFs or some other form of investment, do you have any regrets if you were to do it again? Specifically, looking for people 10+ years into this decision.

I’m at a crossroads currently. My wife and I are 31 and live in Vancouver. We’ve finally saved enough for a downpayment for a townhouse. We have 4 mortgage pre-approvals, an agent, and have visited many properties. At our current income level, we would be able to pay the mortgage, but our next 25 years would be a struggle.

Lately, the idea of renting and investing in ETFs aggressively over the course of 25 years instead. Renting would offer us more financial freedom in life, and we believe, in 25 years, the investments could potentially be worth more than the value of a home, all else being equal.

We’ve been searching the web and it seems like there are far more stories/material about people who’ve done this but are currently 3-5-10 years in their journey. We want to hear from those who are closer to 15+ years into their decision to rent/invest versus purchasing a home.

How are your investments doing? What did you invest in? Any advice if you were to do things again back at year 0? Any regrets or advice?

This is a huge decision for us, and we would like to hear stories from people who’ve gone down this route and how it has turned out for them.

Thank you and your input is invaluable to our decision!",12,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1jn5hyq/rentinginvesting_in_etfs_vs_buying_home_any/,1743311894.0,No_Reveal_1363,1jn5hyq,advice_seeking
investing,buy vs rent,Buy vs Rent - Bay Area Norcal. Fear Getting Priced Out.,"Wife and I live in the east bay area Norcal with two little kiddos. Been renting a house for almost 4 years at $4,400. House likely worth $1.7m being its a 4/2 and about 1/3 an acre. Be about $8500-$9000 a month for mortgage/taxes/insurance. 

I'm about to sell my townhouse I've owned since 2011. I've been renting it out for 3 years only making $1k a month, likely less with taxes. We need to sell in order to pocket the equity and use that as our down IF we are going to buy. I should be making upwards of $600k from the sale in profit. Mortgage on the my townhouse is cheap, have a 2.625 rate BUT it's only a 2/2 980sqft. No way with two kids we could live there. 

**The issue/concern:** Buying and using the $600k in equity or continuing to rent and invest that $600k? **Our out of pocket living would double ($4,400 rent to $9000k buy)** if we were to buy BUT that $$ is going toward a home we'd be in for 20+ years likely. I fear, which might already be the case, if we don't buy now in our area, with housing going up 5% and if rates dip, our $600k wont be as powerful. Two years of renting is about $100k whereas 2 years of buying a $1.6m is about $204k. A positive for continuing to rent is we COULD be saving that $4,000k a month and sock it away. In two years thats $96k on top of the $600k we made on the sale. If we invest those wisely maybe that could be a $800-$1m and be a larger down in 2 years? BUT...if the market slowly climbs and rates go down, in 2 years that $1.6m home will be $1.8m. Might be a wash from how I see it UNLESS I get aggressive with investing. 

Small chance a family member could assist now an extra $200-$300k on top of our $600k for a down payment. BUT thats likely only if we stay local and they like the property. BUT that would turn a $1.7m home into a more palatable $900k loan. 

Wife's income is only going up. Together we're at the $400k mark BUT daycare is killing us and will for another 2 years. Wife has about $1,500 month in student loans for 5 years and a $800 month car payment too. No other debts.

investing,buy vs rent,Real Estate slightly beats renting and investing the difference using average price and rents,"Why do so many people think the S&P outperforms real estate? 

Scenario Setup (U.S. Averages)
	•	Buy a $400,000 home:
	•	20% down = $80,000
	•	4% mortgage over 30 years
	•	4.5% annual home appreciation
	•	Ongoing costs: 1.25% property tax, 1% maintenance, $1,200/year insurance
	•	Rent at $1,700/month:
	•	Rent increases 3.5% annually
	•	Invest initial $80,000 + any annual cost savings in the S&P 500 at 7%

⸻

After 30 Years
	•	Homebuyer:
	•	Home appreciates to ~$1.5M
	•	Mortgage largely paid off
	•	After expenses and inflation, ends with ~$1.2M in equity
	•	Renter/Investor:
	•	Initial $80,000 grows to ~$610,000
	•	Plus invested cost savings (mostly early years when renting is cheaper) brings total to ~$900,000–$1.1M, depending on location and tax conditions

⸻

Result
	•	Buying wins slightly over time due to leverage and forced savings, especially if the buyer holds for 30 years.
	•	Renting + investing is competitive in early years and offers liquidity and flexibility.
	•	Sensitivity to local costs (like rent vs. PITI) and personal discipline with investing heavily affects the outcome.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1kdwysi/real_estate_slightly_beats_renting_and_investing/,1746289814.0,Able_Worker_904,1kdwysi,not_advice_seeking
investing,afford a house,"Can't Afford a House, what should we do with our downpayment?","Hi,

  
My wife and I are looking for some advice, so thank you in advance for any assistance.

We live in a HCOL area. We make decent money, me $130k, her $160k, and are both 35. We have $90k combined in our 401k, another $50k between a ROTH and a T-IRA. We will max out both our 401ks this year. We also have about $225k in a HYSA.

Neither one of us wants to have a long commute, as we have a 4 month old daughter (We have started and are funding a 529 for her), and this means that we really can't afford a home or even condo in our area, we would have a mortgage of at least $7k a month after putting down the full $200k. Really to save money on housing we would have a 1 hr commute each way. Our current rent is $3,500 + about $350 a month in utilities. Our daughter just started daycare at $2,500 a month. 

I know we are in a better position then the average American but am just unsure how to move forward right now. We have talked with grandma about retiring and watching our daughter full time to save on daycare but it seems like a lot for her (She really wants to do it), and our daughter has taken to daycare well and is pretty social. 

  
I guess our question is, what would you do with the money in the HYSA? The S&P seems terrifying right now, the interest rate in the account has dropped from a high of 5.5% down to 3.5%. Would you invest in another markets real estate, put in an index fund, start a small business? How can we take this money and use it for something if it cannot help us purchase a home.

I will add, both of our jobs are a bit up in the air, and we are near the top of what we make in our industry currently. We could be a bit house poor and get a place, but it scares us both knowing finding similar jobs could take a lot of time.

investing,afford a house,Why I am bearish on S&P and sitting tight on my puts,"I’ve been scratching my head the past few weeks watching the S&P grind higher while the macro and micro data just keep flashing warning signs. Let me lay it out:

Consumer weakness:
Walmart, Target, Home Depot, Nike, and Starbucks have all slashed their outlooks. That’s not noise. These are bellwethers across income brackets and sectors. People are clearly trading down, and the middle class is feeling the pinch.

Housing:
The iShares Home Construction ETF ($ITB) is down ~12% YTD. Housing starts have dropped 1.7% YoY. This isn’t just seasonal cooling — it looks like structural demand weakness with higher-for-longer mortgage rates pressuring affordability.

Delinquencies are rising — and not just at the margins:
Credit card and auto loan delinquencies have been steadily ticking higher. We’re not talking about an isolated spike; this is a consistent trend. Households are stretched and cracks are showing.

Yet somehow the market shrugs.
It blew my mind that traders cheered Friday’s jobs report while completely ignoring the downward revision of nearly 90,000 jobs across April and May. That’s not bullish — that’s deteriorating labor data, plain and simple.

Now ask yourself this: Why is Trump pushing so hard for Powell to cut rates?
If the economy is so strong, what’s the urgency? He sees the weakness under the surface — politically, economically, and financially.

I’ve rebalanced, loaded up on puts, and frankly, I have no idea who is still buying up here.

investing,afford a house,Tesla over valued should it be shorted?,"
Over the past few years, Tesla’s stock has been propelled by a narrative of future technological breakthroughs and visionary leadership. However, a closer look at the underlying fundamentals—and in particular a comparison with Chinese giant BYD—reveals several concerning points:
	
1.	Superior Sales and Market Penetration of BYD
	•	In 2022, BYD sold approximately 1.86 million new energy vehicles worldwide, compared with Tesla’s 1.31 million deliveries globally (with only about 440,000 delivered in China) [ ￼].
	
•	BYD’s sales figures reflect its diversified product portfolio—from affordable passenger EVs to commercial vehicles and buses—which has allowed it to capture a larger share of the rapidly expanding global market.
	
•	Prominent voices like Charlie Munger have even remarked that in China, “BYD is so much ahead of Tesla that it’s almost ridiculous,” noting that while Tesla has been forced to reduce prices repeatedly, BYD has maintained a pricing discipline that reinforces its quality perception [ ￼].
	
2.	Integrated Vertical Model and Proprietary IP
	•	BYD’s business model is built on deep vertical integration. It manufactures everything from battery cells (including its innovative blade battery) to complete battery packs, ensuring tighter quality control, faster innovation cycles, and cost efficiencies.
	
•	In contrast, Tesla’s battery strategy still depends heavily on external suppliers such as CATL, Panasonic, and LG Energy Solution. While Tesla touts its in-house 4680 cell as revolutionary, independent analysis shows that its energy density improvements (in Wh/kg) are modest compared to the rapid progress made by competitors [see discussion below].
	
•	BYD’s extensive R&D and robust portfolio of patents in battery technology (and its willingness to license technology to other automakers) suggest that its technological edge isn’t just hype—it translates into real, scalable production improvements. Tesla’s reliance on external providers leaves it vulnerable if those suppliers or competing integrated players (like BYD) drive down costs and improve performance.
	
3.	Limited Technological Differentiation on Core Battery Metrics
	
•	A key metric for EV performance is energy density (Wh/kg). Despite much fanfare around Tesla’s battery innovations, the improvements in energy density aren’t dramatically superior to those achieved by BYD and other leading manufacturers.
	
•	This calls into question whether Tesla’s premium valuation—built largely on future expectations—can be sustained if its core battery technology isn’t materially better. BYD, on the other hand, combines modest improvements in battery performance with a proven, fully integrated production process that has already translated into higher sales volumes and broader market acceptance.
	
4.	The Overvaluation Argument and Market Sentiment
	
•	Tesla’s current market valuation appears to be based on an almost irrational optimism about future robotaxis, autonomous driving, and energy storage breakthroughs—none of which have yet materially improved the company’s profitability or production volumes.
	
•	With BYD now not only supplying its own vehicles but also securing contracts as a battery supplier for other major players (including recent agreements where BYD’s FinDreams unit is set to supply Tesla’s Shanghai energy storage facility [ ￼]), the narrative that Tesla is the sole leader in battery innovation is weakening.
	
•	When you combine lower vehicle sales numbers, an overreliance on third-party suppliers, and only modest improvements in battery performance, the rationale behind Tesla’s high valuation starts to crumble. Investors may eventually reprice Tesla based on its current fundamentals rather than its lofty future projections.

Conclusion

From this perspective, the argument for shorting Tesla centers on the idea that:
	
•	BYD’s strong global sales, robust vertical integration, and advanced battery IP are not only outpacing Tesla in key markets (especially in China) but also provide a more sustainable competitive advantage.
	
•	Tesla’s reliance on external suppliers and its relatively modest improvements in core battery metrics (like energy density) suggest that its premium valuation is built on an overly optimistic narrative.
	
•	If market sentiment shifts away from these future promises and begins to focus on near-term fundamentals, Tesla could see a significant correction.


Had gpt organize my info dump in a readable format . But byd is clearly a company that should be valued more it makes no sense that tesla has it’s current valuation. Also throw in global anti American economic sentiment and anti elon well. Seems to make sense that their stock will decline.

Every dollar I make in salary at my workplace represents a minute, hour, day, or some other unit of time I will NEVER get back. It represents time I'm not spending with family and time I'm not out enjoying myself.

Watching that money disappear is like shaving years off my life. Hell, I'd say burning it may even be more productive since some people at least get some form of enjoyment out of smoking cigarettes...

Now obviously, I need that money to afford food and whatnot, so I can't go quitting my job. But I do not spend frivolously on luxury goods. I live in a modest house in the suburbs and drive a 20 yr old, 4 cylinder Japanese compact hatchback.

\--------------------

Late in 1999, I was given a $3k High School graduation present. Opened an eTrade account and bought a bunch tech stocks (Microsoft, Dell, IBM, Cisco, Juniper, etc) Made a couple thousand more in under a year. Figured I couldn't lose, as I had a background in tech. As an engineering student, I knew the industry. Or at least I thought I did.

By the early 2000s, my portfolio was worth three digits.

Before I pulled the plug and sold all my stocks, I was literally sitting on the computer the entirety of 2002, 2003, and 2004 hitting Refresh and watching my portfolio lose value.

I had some startup companies that were promising that ended up going under and their stock values ended up being ZERO.

I did not, and still to this day do not know where the money went. It just disappeared.

People tell me I sold in the dip when I should have bought more. I was in high school/college. I was working low end jobs and needed the money. I had no money to invest.

Few years later, I got grandmothers inheritance to the tune of $30k in 2005. Bought a house for cash in the boonies and put another $10k in my own savings into it (paint, carpet, trim work, etc.) Sold the house for $65k three months later.

Wanted a bachelor pad, so I bought another small house,  closer to where I wanted to live on an ARM in 2006 and was upside down, two years later... $240k mortgage at 5% going up to 7% in three years on a house that appraised for $125k.

BUT at least I had a roof over my head. I still own that house and it's now a rental property.

I buy houses that I can flip/rent. They're tangible and I can control what work goes into them. If I want to make a house increase in value, I can renovate it. And an house will NEVER be worth NOTHING. Even if it burns down to the ground, the vacant land will have value. Insurance also covers losses on a house. Can't insure stocks.

I am VERY risk adverse, having been bitten before.

I can not control the value of a stock. I have zero influence if a company will release a gadget that will catch on and be the next big thing or if it will flop.

I can't subtly count cards, so I don't set foot in casinos.

I'm of the mindset that to invest in stocks, you need to have money that you're not afraid of losing.

How can I get out of this mindset so that I can YOLO all my savings on whatever wallstreetbets is peddling this week? People make bank day trading.

investing,afford a house,"If I can afford the short-term losses, would renting my home for a small loss every month and have renters pay the majority of my mortgage be financially beneficial?","My friend and I have been constantly arguing over the last two years.

I own a small home. The mortgage is $2200 a month - I can rent out my home at a reasonable $2000 a month. I have $4000 set aside, already saved for incidentals during renting, and will be accounting for the $200 deficit and will add $150 every month for a maintenance fund. Additionally, I have a financial buffer in stocks which if everything went wrong, I could reallocate some of my investments to float for at least a year.

I plan to buy a new modest home and live there while allowing renters to help pay my mortgage on this current home, but I'm aware that I will NOT be MAKING money in the short term. However, at $150,000 a year salary, I know I can afford to lose some money in the short term. 

My argument is, that if you view the house as an asset, and the mortgage as a debt and NOT as a business venture, then yes, I'm losing money in short term, but if I liquidated the home at any time, then I would get the payday of the money which renters have been paying. My NET worth is actually rising, and benefitting, even though I'm allowing my CURRENT liquidity to suffer. 

What does r/investing think of this?

investing,first home,Pilotless planes are taking flight in China. Bank of America says it’s time to buy,"While startups around the world have tried to build vehicles that can fly without a pilot, only one is certified to carry people — in China.

U.S.-listed [Ehang](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/EH/) received this certification from China’s aviation regulator in late March, and the company plans to begin operating flights for tourists [along a few designated routes by the end of June](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/04/china-may-see-flying-taxis-in-three-years-ehang-predicts.html). The vehicle, known as an eVTOL aircraft, carries two passengers and uses electric power for vertical take-off and landing, similar to a helicopter.

“Ehang should maintain 100% market share in China over 2025-27, as the strict \[the Civil Aviation Administration of China\] airworthiness process poses a high entry barrier to new entrants,” Bank of America Greater China industrials stock analysts said in a May 14 report.

They initiated coverage of the stock with a “buy” rating, and predict the stock can reach $26 — 36% above Friday’s close. The stock is up more than 20% for the year so far.

The analysts expect Ehang to benefit from national policy support and faster-than-expected delivery to tourism customers.

Ehang also [ranked first among global players](https://aamrealityindex.com/f/advanced-air-mobility-reality-index-april-2025-release) as the most likely to reach the thousand-unit-a-year milestone through widespread certification and adoption, according to a recent report from U.S.-based SMG Consulting.

U.S.-based rival [Joby Aviation](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/JOBY/), whose shares have dropped 9% year to date, ranked fourth. Fifth in the rankings was [Archer Aviation](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ACHR/). Its shares are up 36% for the year. The company on Thursday announced it will be the official air taxi provider for the [Olympic Games in Los Angeles in 2028](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250515642674/en/Archer-Selected-as-the-Official-Air-Taxi-Provider-of-the-LA28-Olympic-and-Paralympic-Games-and-Team-USA-in-Exclusive-Deal).

Bank of America does not currently cover either stock.

The [U.S. Federal Aviation Administration](https://www.faa.gov/air-taxis) has been [working on certification rules](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/05/archer-aviation-faa-signoff.html) for allowing the companies to fly their vehicles with passengers in the U.S., although initial focus is on piloted flights.

In contrast, China has accelerated its efforts [in the last two years](https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202503/1329853.shtml) to develop what it calls the “low-altitude economy.”

About 300 local Chinese governments have announced related plans as of April 2025, which include investment in infrastructure for eVTOL operation and business subsidies, the Bank of America analysts said in a separate May 14 report about the overall industry.

Ehang’s certified model, the 216-S, sells for about 2.39 million yuan ($330,000) in China, and $410,000 outside China, the report said. It noted that the larger, 4-seat Joby S4 sells for $1.3 million.

“We conclude that the central gov’t sees the development of low-altitude economy as the crucial strategic industry to China’s economy in the coming few years,” the analysts said.

The policy also covers support for using drones to deliver food and supplies to tourist sites in the mountains. Such tests [gained popularity over the May 1 Labor Day](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/07/cnbcs-the-china-connection-newsletter-tourism-surge-defies-slowdown.html) holiday in China.

Several Chinese companies from Xpeng to Volant are also working on flying devices that carry people. Short-haul aerial vehicles can also help with firefighting and emergency services.

For Ehang, the Bank of America analysts predict each tourist attraction will want to buy five to 10 eVTOLs, supporting a total potential China market of 80,000 units.

In the near term, they estimate Ehang’s delivery volume will reach 442 units this year, and 813 next year. “This will translate into 103%/82% revenue growth in 2025/26E,” the report said.

Another, more distant, area of potential growth is the urban air taxi market.

While the analysts expect tourism to be the main driver of demand in the near term, they expect air taxis to grow their share starting from the year 2035. Based on the current taxi and ride-hailing car market, Bank of America estimates total demand for eVTOL air taxis could reach 200,000 units in the future.

“If the annual revenue per air taxi could reach RMB1.5mn by 2035, the air taxi operation will be profitable and … should bring incremental revenue and earnings to Ehang in the long term,” the analysts said.

But the Bank of America analysts cautioned that any accident or passenger injuries could result in reputational damage for Ehang, on top of potential legal claims. Significant incidents could also slow the pace of eVTOL adoption, the analysts pointed out.",1003,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1kpng3q/pilotless_planes_are_taking_flight_in_china_bank/,1747584325.0,SscorpionN08,1kpng3q,not_advice_seeking

investing,first home,"As a 25 year old, should buying a house be my first priority as an investment?","I am 25 years old and I am really wanting to buy a house as soon as possible. I know the market isn't that good currently, but the thing is I don't see it getting any better any time soon. So what's the point of waiting? The thing is I don't see the American housing market situation improving any time soon. Couple of things.

1) There's just not enough supply for the demand of housing. And housing isn't really something that you can push out the supply as fast as other products. 

2) I am constantly hearing how large corporations are buying up large swaths of single family homes and renting them out. So are there even going to be homes to buy if I keep waiting? Or will I be a subject to a landlord forever? 

3) I am not a xenophobic (I myself am an immigrant), but I do worry about the very high numbers new migrants coming to the US. Like I believe a few years ago under another administration I read that if borders cross got over 1,000 a day it would be a national emergency, I believe a few months back it crossed 3,000. Again, as an immigrant myself I know quite a few people like that, I know how hard they're willing to work and how much more they're willing to struggle. I know guys that work like 20 hours a day and share a small apartment with like 8 other people.  I can't compete with that. Eventually once they get their papers, they're going to be looking for a house too. So demand is just going to keep increasing. 

4) Sometimes I'll hear that maybe this housing bubble will burst. Almost every home I look on Zillow around me is quite literally double than what is was pre-pandemic (2019/2020). Houses that were 200k, are now 400k. Houses that were 300k are now 600k. The thing is, if this bubble burst, and prices do fall... I know there'll be millions of Gen Z that have saved up money to buy a house that will immdeiatly pounce on the opporunity. I know so many friends/collouges that have like 40, 50, 60k in savings just itching to buy a house when prices lower. So if that happens, won't prices just go back up then? Because everyone will just competing to buy the available homes?

All these things considered, so I am (as like many Gen Z) just worried about my future, if I'll ever be able to be a homeowner, as it is the dream of many Americans, and think, if it looks like things aren't really going to improve, why not buy now?",148,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1elzqve/as_a_25_year_old_should_buying_a_house_be_my/,1722995563.0,SonGoku_USA,1elzqve,advice_seeking
investing,first home,FRB Chair Jerome Powell’s Commencement Speech at Princeton University,"
Full Prepared Remarks:
https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20250525a.htm

Excerpt:

“After graduation, I had no plan and no job, and wound up putting labels on shelves in a warehouse for six months. I didn't feel great about that. One of my closest friends was getting a master's at Stanford, and I could only think—""Nice going, Jay. You really nailed it."" In hindsight, that time in the warehouse was a blessing, and exactly what I needed. The next fall I entered law school, and for the first time I was highly resolved to make the most of the opportunity.

You know what? We all move at our own pace, and that's ok. Fifty years later I can tell you something I did not know then: The vast majority of what you need to know about work, about relationships, about yourself, about life, you have yet to learn. And that itself is a tremendous gift. Over the remainder of your life, you can—you must—continue to educate yourself and to grow as a person, becoming more focused on what really matters, more widely knowledgeable, better read, more disciplined, and more strategic. But also wiser, kinder, more empathetic, more generous, more loving, more forgiving of others and of yourself. Each of us is a work in progress. The possibilities for self-improvement are limitless.

Another thing I have realized is that while hard work, determination, and creativity matter a great deal to success in life, luck plays a big role too. All of us here are tremendously lucky. I know that, at a handful of critical times in my life, I got really lucky—beginning at birth.

My parents were well educated. They gave the six Powell kids a safe, loving home, and placed a high value on learning. They gave us everything we needed to thrive. That bit of luck led to the good luck I share with all of you, the chance to earn a degree from America's finest university.

Another thing I have learned along the way is that, as you strive in coming years to reach your full potential, you will need to take risks and make mistakes.

Everyone makes mistakes. Take it from an expert! But the bigger mistake is to avoid taking risks.”",826,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1kvfl1c/frb_chair_jerome_powells_commencement_speech_at/,1748214201.0,korstocks,1kvfl1c,not_advice_seeking

Young investor here (30’s) and cautiously watching all this play out.

I’m currently DCAing $4,000 a month into VOO and have been since the greatest bull run in history post COVID. Sitting with about $95k total in my portfolio with an emergency fund that can last me a year or two unemployed in cash. 

As someone who has never lived through a financial crisis I’m getting concerned about such a heavy investment of my take home (4k out of $7k a month) with possibility of layoffs. I’m a software engineer and the market is rough as hell from what I’ve heard anecdotally.

My play currently is to keep the $4k a month DCA into the S&P and sing god bless America the whole way down hoping for an early retirement after the show is over and hold onto my butt that my company doesn’t go out of business or do layoffs.

How do you mentally prepare for big drops and stay steady with your strategy? 

Am I overestimating my risk tolerance and should shove some of the income into a money market or hard cash or hang on?

investing,first home,"Formerly Stable US Treasuries Are Trading Like Risky Assets; 2008-esque in Warning to Trump, US Dollar tanks MASSIVELY","***Data sourced via Bloomberg:***

When the US does something truly self-defeating and stupid, the natural response of currency traders is to seek an Alpine sanctuary. The Swiss franc is regarded as the safest of havens. So it’s significant that the dollar just endured its worst day compared to the Swiss Franc since 2015, falling more than 3% to take it to a level last touched during the debt ceiling debacle of August 2011. 

Essentially, the US very nearly decided to default on its debt when it didn’t have to. The latest rush to the Swiss redoubt suggests that the market thinks that the Liberation Day tariffs, subsequently retracting some of them, and the scarcely credible 145% levies on Chinese goods constitute the stupidest acts of US economic policy since then. The selloff intensified in Asian trading. At one point, the dollar had dropped more than 5% since Wednesday’s announced climbdown over reciprocal tariffs.

One logical explanation for a weakening dollar after strong inflation numbers would center on bond yields. All else equal, lower inflation makes it easier to cut rates, and will bring down short-term yields. The differential between two-year yields has been a key driver of the exchange rate and lower US yields should mean a weaker dollar. 

The problem with this theory is that the differential has widened sharply in the US favor of late. The dollar’s slump has come as Treasury yields have risen sharply above German bunds — itself a remarkable occurrence only weeks after Germany committed to its biggest fiscal expansion in generations (largely in response to the Vance speech as it decided it could no longer treat Washington as a reliable ally).

Short-term yields are more important to the currency, but the move in longer bonds has been more startling. The real 30-year yield, as pure a measure of the cost of long-term money as exists, has now reached a high only previously seen during the spasm that followed the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy in 2008.

It's hard to cast this as anything other than a significant loss of confidence in the US. It doesn’t have to be terminal sure. The shock of the debt-ceiling crisis in 2011 turned out to be a major turning point that was followed by a decade of American Exceptionalism. But the moves in the bond and currency markets — to a far greater extent than stocks (which by the way endured a massive selloff Thursday and gave up more than half of Wednesday’s gains) — ram home that a lot is at stake. And the US is currently embarked on what appears to be a wholesale change in foreign policy, not struggling to get things back to normal.

How could this crisis of confidence come just as the US has come through its inflation trial? The problem is that almost all economic data is now coming off as backward-looking. Nobody cares. Similarly with the corporate earnings season, kicked off Friday morning by the big banks, there will be minimal interest in how things went in the first quarter. All now depends on what CEOs have to say about how they’ll live in a new world in which the US and China have effectively imposed a trade embargo on each other.

TL:DR; - The dollar just suffered its worst day against the Swiss franc since 2015, as global markets fled to safety amid what they see as economic self-sabotage by the U.S. From erratic tariff whiplash to sky-high levies on Chinese goods, traders are treating Washington’s latest moves as a full-blown confidence crisis. Bond markets are flashing red, real 30-year yields now rival the panic levels seen after Lehman’s collapse. Even strong inflation data can’t paper over the chaos, as markets look past stats and earnings to the looming question: how will companies, and countries, navigate a world where the U.S. has torched economic diplomacy?

I am a 31y M saving for a down payment for within 10-24 months. I’ve been saving for 7 years, so it’s built up decently along the way. The allocations are as follows: 55% HYSA in Vanguard Cash Plus, 31% vanguard ETF funds (heavily weighted towards stock ETFs), and 14% company stock via vested RSUs.

I know I should likely sell the majority of RSUs, but I work at a strong performing company where analyst expectations are all very favorable and I (perhaps foolishly) believe could outperform the broader market. Is it crazy to hold such a high allocation of these shares?

Moreover, should I be selling all my ETFs and putting into my HYSA to insulate myself from risk within two years of a purchase? I’ve only ever bought and held, so I’m also unsure if I should be getting a financial advisor to understand tax implications?

investing,down payment savings,What is the argument for not putting a large down payment on a house?,"Obviously the current house market is a lil off and there are higher interest rates in the past (let’s call it 6 percent). If you are in the market for a 500k house and you have 400k in wealth, why would you not put 300k on the house? This leaves the 100k safety net/entertainment money accessible . This scenario can assume this average person is already saving well for retirement.

What is the argument to only putting 20% down and keeping the rest liquid.

The mortgage rates are higher than a high yield savings, so seems like that is not an option. 

The market is generally scary (Especially this week…but that’s another argument) so getting consistent returns of >6 percent seems like risk/reward isn’t there. 

Positive argument would be having a large amount of cash liquid to enjoy the money more, invest, or buy toys.

investing,down payment savings,Advice for 73 yr old who lost $200k,"My FIL started dating a much younger drug addict.  That went about as well as you would expect. He had $200k cash and its all gone. He is now $30k in consumer debt and developing signs of either Alzheimers or dementia, we don’t have diagnosis yet. 

He was living in NC and we are now moving him across the country to live near us so we can keep an eye on him. The plan for now is to have him live with us so we can assess his ability to function independently. 

He does have a fully paid house. Realtor is saying it will probably go for $300-$350k. He gets $2500/ month in social security. 

We will probably just keep the funds in a HYSA until we have a strategy. 

We could

1. Have him live with us until he requires round the clock care. Use the house funds as savings for him. 

2. If he is able to function independently for a while, he could buy a house here and live on social security. Or we could move in with him once he needs more help, then potentially sell the house when he needs more intensive care. 

3. Maybe something in between where he puts down a down payment on a house, we pay the mortgage, we all live together, and he has a savings left over. Again, could sell if he needed to recover his down payment. 

3. Something else Im unaware of. Maybe some different investment vehicle for the house funds. 

Oh and obviously the consumer debt would get paid through the sell of the house.

My mortgage payment is $2,500 and I owe 280k on it while the house is now worth around 600k. The rate is 3.65% so paying it off early isn’t really worth it. I don’t have any other expenses aside from typical utilities and groceries/food. Both of my cars are paid off and valued at approximately 20k and 50k. 

I will have a pension through my job and will be eligible to retire with 50% of my salary at 45 years old, or I can stay longer to increase that number. Additionally I contribute to a 401k and have maxed it out the last three years. The value of the 401k is currently 92k. I will continue to make the maximum contribution. 

I have 270k in a high yield savings account earning 4.31%. I’m happy with this as it’s bringing in around $1,000 a month. Should I have a large amount of this account in the market instead? I would put it in VOO if I did decide to do this. If I did decide to do this, how much would be a reasonable amount?

So my mom got a wild hair a few days ago and sent me $1000 to invest for her. I told her it’s really a gamble for anything short term and long term is the safer bet.

She loves to gamble and pretty much said here’s $1000. If we lose, we lose. If we win even split. 

My question is: should I ignore her wanting a quick possible win? Like buying 100 stocks of a possible up and coming? If so which company? Penny stocks maybe and become bullish?

investingforbeginners,what to do with extra money,This sub has awful advice,"It’s supposed to be about “investing for beginners”. Stop shilling your fucking crypto and garbage stocks. I swear 90% of comments on these posts could be detrimental to someone’s future. 

If the comment doesn’t mention a high-yield savings account and/or: VOO, SPY, VTI, or something similar like VT then it is not investing for beginners.

Like no you shouldn’t yolo into PayPal or chegg or anything stupid like that. Jfc people come here with important questions about their future financial security. Stop offering advice if you don’t have a proven track record of investing.  Go back to Wall Street bets you degenerates 


Edit: was banned from subreddit for this then gracefully let back in. Shoutout to the mods!!

Here are my tips (outside of my angry rant):


1. Open a high yield savings account and get like 5-10k in there for an emergency fund (I like capital one but there are plenty of others if you look it up)
2. Open a fidelity brokerage account 
3. Put in any money you don’t need for at least 3 years
4. Purchase shares of VOO or VTI (vti is slightly less risk, but they’re very similar); my core holding are in VOO
5. Every time you get a paycheck purchase a share or half a share (whatever you can afford)

If you have a job you would be eligible for opening an Roth IRA. This is a tax free account that is incredibly important but you can’t touch the money without a 10% penalty until 59.5 years old. This shit is butter right here bc it’s tax free but be mindful. You won’t see this money for 45 years. 

[Correction from comments: you can take out any original cash you deposited w/o penalty if life hits rock bottom or medical emergency]

That’s why I pump my IRA as much as possible but then add extra savings to my brokerage for slightly more short term goals (e.g. a house in 5 years)


Do yourself a favor as well and look up a compound interest calculator. Play with it and add in say 1000 principal (money you start with) then contribute $200 a month. Return rate should roughly be 8% with VOO or VTI and see how much it will kick back over time. It’s astounding and truly motivating to see what your money will become 


Final edit: I’ve had a 60%+ return over the course of 3 years (not guaranteed moving forward but just to show some level of credibility). I used to play the individual stock game for about 5 years before that and never made close to what I’ve made with VOO. Although it’s boring - index funds like this one are absolutely the way to go. If you’re feeling crazy you can do 90% VOO and then 10% individual stocks. Study up on earnings, revenue, P/E ratio etc before you seriously consider these individual stocks. If any experts have additional metrics they like to use comment below! (Or deeper explanation of VOO v VTI or anything else I missed)  let’s get some real advice in this sub.",281,https://www.reddit.com/r/investingforbeginners/comments/1me4sw2/this_sub_has_awful_advice/,1753976102.0,Logical-Bullfrog7100,1me4sw2,advice_seeking
investingforbeginners,what to do with extra money,"I just received $250,000 and I don't know what to do next.","Intro:

About $250,000 cash (after taxes) has just come into my possession. The reason for this post is to humbly ask for direction from people with more experience than myself so I can invest this money effectively. I can't afford to blow this opportunity. I want to use it to change my career and set up a successful future for myself and my family. Please understand, I know times are tough for everyone right now. I do not wish to boast, and I understand the gravity of this opportunity. I don't want to screw this up, so I appreciate any advice you can give me.

About Me:

I'm a 29M father, happily married, living in the USA. I have a bachelor's degree in business management/finance. I have experience managing a handful of businesses, including a couple startups. My career has taken a turn for the worse lately, and I currently have no income or job (i.e. lots of time on my hands). My ONLY debt is a modest mortgage with a very low interest rate. My assets amount to less than $40,000, so my net worth (after the mortgage) is negative. My primary skills include finance, mathematics, and engineering. I'm NOT interested in speculation right now (""get rich quick"" schemes), and I will NOT be joining an MLM. I am willing to put full-time work into this investment. I'm willing to work with my hands or sit at a desk all day if needed, though long-term, I'd like to take on more of a management role.

My Goals:

My top priority is earning income to support my family. I need to make at least $60,000 from year one. Before this $250,000 became mine, I was applying to hundreds of jobs with no luck. My secondary priorities include saving money for my kids' education and setting up a comfortable retirement for my wife and I. I see these as consequential once I achieve my primary goal. While I'd prefer not to move more than an hour away from my current home, I'm willing to move out-of-state to achieve my goals. I'd be willing to move my family out of the USA for a few years, if necessary.

Investments I'm currently considering:

Stocks/Bonds

* I have some experience with stocks/bonds. I plan to invest in these long-term. However, unless I'm speculating, I wouldn't expect these to generate more than 10% ROI ($25,000 annual income based on my $250k), so I don't see them as a good short-term solution to my income needs.

Commercial Real Estate

* I'm very interested in owning some income-generating RE. But again, from my research, a GOOD Cap Rate for your typical RE property is something like 10-14%. That means, to achieve my income goal of $60k, I'd have to invest something like $500k-700k into a property. (Even more when you consider interests rates on the loan I'd have to take out.)

Purchasing a Small Business

* I'm MOST interested in this option right now. I've looked at websites like BizBuySell, and there are a lot of established businesses going up for sale every day. I assume, with the help of an SBA 7a loan, I'll have a budget of about $600k to buy a business like this. Many companies being listed within this budget boast Seller's Discretionary Earnings (SDE) of $100k-200k. It seems the primary drawback of this type of investment is the amount of work that goes into the purchase and management of the company, and of course, the lack of liquidity. But that's not an issue in my circumstance. And with the extra cash leftover from the SDE, I could even hire a manager to help ensure my success.

Conclusion

I'm in search of advice and ideas from you. I recognize I don't know everything, and some of the assumptions I've mentioned in this post might be wrong. I'm interested in what kind of perspective the members of THIS sub can bring. This is probably the only shot I have to change my life, and I don't want to blow it. Thanks for your help!

investingforbeginners,what to do with extra money,Ways to make my portfolio better,"Hi Everyone! 

Im a 17F slowly investing money over the last year, putting around 30 dollars a week into my fidelity in different ETFs this past year since I got a part-time job, I have a Roth IRA and a brokerage account. I am a first gen immigrant and no one in my inner circle nor family have much investing knowledge, so I come here.  I want to keep my investments low risk and to grow compound interest overtime so I can be more financially stable and not drowning in debt by the time I become an adult with a career and student loans.

Currently 

* $20 goes to VOO split by both accounts (weekly)
* $10 into QQQ (weekly)
* $5 into SCHD (weekly)
* I also do lump sum (or what I consider lump sum) in like $500 or $100 every couple months when I have some extra money that I don't allocate to food or other high school teen expenses LOL. 

**ROTH IRA (around $200)** 

* FXAIX
* UTWO
* VOO

Most of the money is in VOO because it's whats secure, and so far its been doing pretty well, UTWO literally does nothing, and FXAIX is another S&P 500, I would like to diversify this account but honestly not too sure how to. 

**BROKERAGE (around $1000)**

* FXAIX
* QQQM
* SCHD
* VOO

Most of the money here is also in VOO as im close to finally buying one whole stock of VOO LOL, then I have around 250ish dollars in SCHD and then around $200 in FXAIX and then basically nothing in QQQ. 

  
I also know I have some random CashApp stocks when I wanted to experiement with the stock market but those have been basically abandoned LOL. 

I want to diversify to some international stocks and ETFs and non top preforming companies as I know there is a lot of overlap between the ETFs I have picked. Still want to keep it somewhat low risk. I did invest in SCHD since I would like to have some passive income from dividends, and so far those payouts (though not much) have been reinvested.

I'd really appreciate the advice from some more seasoned investors for some help to hopefully build a successful portfolio! ",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/investingforbeginners/comments/1luttlz/ways_to_make_my_portfolio_better/,1751993728.0,LumiLights,1luttlz,advice_seeking

investingforbeginners,bonus invest,My Strategy,"I have been reading a little about stocks and ETFs and I think I have decided on a clear strategy that covers all the things I have heard are needed: constancy, dicipline, diversification and patience.

Every day, I will be investing 1 dollar in a stock. To choose the stock I will be investing in I'm going to use a roulette wheel with three indexes (S&P 500, Dow Jones, Nasdaq 100). Then, once I've chosen an index, I'll use another roulette to choose a random stock from that index, and thats what the daily stock will be. This will use the principle of variable reward to keep me diciplined into investing every day.
As a bonus, if I get 1 share of every stock in an index, then I will reward myself with a whole year (365$) of that full ETF.

In case I see one particular stock suffering (more than a 7% dip) then I will sell and redistribute it on the purchase of the next day, so I will keep my money safe.

I have also read that investing is a long term thing, so I will set my goal of buying my own house within 5 years thanks to this strategy, as I have a friend that does trading and he said he could make me some good profit if I gave him my money, but I wanted to try this first.

If any of this strategy could be better I would like to know, so please comment any suggestions.

P.S: I just found out about this thing called ""Options"". It sounds interesting, so I will think about how to include it in my strategy.",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/investingforbeginners/comments/1l9dmtl/my_strategy/,1749703115.0,Deam996,1l9dmtl,advice_seeking
investingforbeginners,bonus invest,Seeking Guidance for Long-Term SIP & Investment Plan (25k/month + Annual Lump Sum) Please Suggest Funds,"Hi everyone, I’ve recently started planning my long-term investments and would love to get some feedback and suggestions from experienced folks here. I want to invest with at least a 10-year horizon, ideally longer, primarily through SIPs and periodic lump sums.

Here’s what I have in mind currently:

Planning to start SIPs worth ₹25,000/month, focused on equity mutual funds.

Already contributing ₹17,000/month to NPS, so retirement component is partially covered.

Planning to invest a ₹50,000 lumpsum every New Year, consistently for the long term.

Intending to apply a 10-15% step-up on my SIPs every year to account for income growth.

Will try to invest any additional income like bonuses, incentives, etc., as lumpsum investments whenever possible.


My Questions:

1. Does this approach sound reasonable for long-term wealth creation?


2. How should I ideally distribute the ₹25k SIP -  large-cap, flexi-cap, mid/small-cap, etc.?


3. Should I consider Index Funds as part of the core portfolio?


4. Please recommend specific SIPs/funds (mutual funds or index funds) that are good for long-term, steady growth based on current market conditions.


5. Any suggestions on funds that have been consistent over the long term?


6. Is there anything I’m missing in this plan from a risk management or tax perspective?



I’m not looking for aggressive, short-term gains more focused on steady, long-term growth with reasonable risk. Open to suggestions and experiences from others who’ve been on a similar journey.

Currently, it keeps floating around $300–$320, and it doesn’t seem like it will return to its previous level in the foreseeable future—especially given the U.S. pulling back from green policies and bonuses for people buying electric cars.

At the same time, I’ve invested in some ETFs and rising Polish companies, and I’ve seen solid returns there. Now I’m wondering what the correct course of action would be regarding the Tesla stock I still hold:

1. Should I keep it and hope that, in the future, it will at least return to its peak value?
2. Should I sell it, accept the loss, and invest the money in a company with better profit potential?
3. Or is there some other option?",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/investingforbeginners/comments/1lkxkv2/tesla_sell_or_keep/,1750936838.0,wojciechsura,1lkxkv2,advice_seeking

I started my business, which I am at the end of my rope and want to pursue a career or another business venture. I am a chiropractor and own my practice, this september would be the 5 year mark since starting my practice.
We bought a 3 fam house in the same town we live in for 800k, and have 400k debt on it. Net rent from this asset (after the mortgage is paid is about 40k per year).
We also own a 2 family home in which we live in, purchased 2020 for 450k, about 300k debt with a very low 3.175 interest rate, so we are never paying it early. We rent the upstairs apartment for 1400, and our mortgage and taxes monthly is about 2400. So we have a low overhead which is the way we were able to save so much with very good incomes, my wife make 240k with bonus as a nurse pracititooner and I average about 360k gross per year on my last 4 tax returns.
I am struggling with what to do. I still have 360k in student loan debt. As a business owner, I get my AGI as low as possible therefore my loan payment is minimal every month. My original plan is to acquire more rental property (3 or 4 more multi family properties with the 1.3 Mil we saved) but the real estate market is nuts rn.
We are in North NJ bergen county. And I feel like I need a 3 month break, then come back and re-evaluate but I dont want to just stop but I feel like I need to. For those of you that may say just take 3 months off  you own your own business, I cant really do that without losing all my patients, and hiring someone in my to work for me, really wont work.
I considered just thowing 1.2 M in a low cost etf in a taxable brokerage accoount but I prefer real estate for tax advantages and I just like real assets vs the stock market.
Hoping to gain another persons perspective, I may also be cross posting on another forum. The student loan debt I have, I could in theory buy another rental property that produces 50k net per year, pay off my 3 family and have about 90k-100k per year in net rental income. I would have my student loans paid off in 4 years and still have 90/100k in income from the rental properties. I do not want to just pay off my loans with the saved income as that reduces my purchasing power not to mention appreciation if I just bought another rental property in cash and paid off my 3 family.

investingforbeginners,getting started investing,[Evergreen Guide: How to Start Investing – 2025],"**Getting Started: Your Investing Journey Begins Here**

Are you new to investing and feeling overwhelmed about where to start? You're not alone! On a daily basis, we have questions asked on:

>*""How can I invest?""*  
*""Where do I start investing?""*  
*""What should I be investing in?""*  
*""I have $1,000 in VOO, should I be investing in more?""*

This should hopefully be a resource to help the whole spectrum of investors understand how to begin investing!

We even had a notable young investor, awhile back now, share how:

>*""Hey everyone! I've just turned 15 and got my first summer job. I'm asking for personal finance advice in other communities, but I wanted some advice on how to start investing. I'm not sure what I even need to learn to get good or to start. I only have some cash, so I'm not sure if that can really make a different, but I guess it's good to start practicing now.*

>*Can anyone point me to some starting resources or maybe golden advice when it comes to investing? Also, where do I even invest when I'm under 18?*

Where do I even begin?](https://www.reddit.com/r/investingforbeginners/comments/14jvoyv/i_want_to_start_investing_but_it_seems_so/)

We'll break down **WHERE** to invest (best platforms and accounts), **WHAT** to invest in (assets and portfolio strategies), and **WHEN** to invest (timing, mindset, and long-term success).

Even if you’re under 18, there are still ways to get started through **custodial accounts** or **investing with a parent’s guidance**. The important thing is to begin **learning and practicing smart investing habits now**, so you can build wealth over time.

# How to Open a Brokerage Account

1. **Choose a brokerage** based on fees, platform usability, and available assets.
2. **Gather necessary documents** such as government-issued ID, Social Security Number (SSN) or equivalent, and banking details.
3. **Open the account** online by following the brokerage’s registration process.
4. **Fund your account** via bank transfer, wire transfer, or direct deposit.
5. **Start investing** by selecting assets aligned with your goals and risk tolerance.
6. **Set up automatic contributions** to ensure consistent investing habits.
7. **Familiarize yourself with order types** such as market, limit, and stop-loss orders.

# Investment Goals & Time Horizon

Your investment plan should focus on the future and include things like purchasing a home, funding education, or preparing for retirement. Defining clear objectives will determine how you configure your portfolio:

* **Short-term goals (1-5 years):** Money needed soon should be kept in low-risk investments like high-yield savings accounts, money market funds, or short-term bonds.
* **Mid-term goals (5-15 years):** A balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds can help grow wealth while managing risk.
* **Long-term goals (15+ years):** Primarily stock-focused portfolios provide the highest growth potential over decades.

# WHAT to Invest In (Assets & Portfolio Basics)

# Asset Allocation & Diversification

* **Asset Classes:** Stocks, bonds, real estate, and cash.
* **Diversification:** Spreading investments across different sectors reduces risk.
* **Sector Diversification:** Investing in industries like technology, healthcare, and finance protects against downturns in any one area.
* **Geographical Diversification:** Exposure to international markets ensures stability when domestic markets face volatility.
* **Rebalancing:** Adjust portfolio allocations periodically to maintain your target allocation.

# Example Beginner Portfolio (3-Fund Portfolio)

1. **Total Stock Market ETF (e.g., VTI or SCHB) – 60%**
2. **Total International Stock ETF (e.g., VXUS) – 30%**
3. **Total Bond Market ETF (e.g., BND) – 10%**

📌 **Tip:** The younger you are, the higher your stock allocation should be since you have time to recover from market downturns.

# The Cost of Waiting to Invest

* A common mistake is delaying investing out of fear or uncertainty.
* Historical data shows that investing immediately outperforms waiting for the “perfect” time.
* Example study: An investor who invests annually at the market peak (worst timing) still performs better than one who stays in cash.

# WHEN to Start Investing (Timing & Mindset)

# Emergency Fund & Cash Reserves

* **How much to keep:** 3-6 months of expenses.
* **Where to store it:** High-yield savings accounts, money market funds.
* **Why it matters:** Provides liquidity for emergencies without disrupting investments.
* **Investment strategy:** Prioritize building an emergency fund before investing aggressively.

# Portfolio Maintenance & Adjustments

* **Rebalance annually** to maintain target allocations.
* **Adjust allocations as you age** (gradually reducing stock exposure for more stability).
* **Stay informed but avoid market timing**—stick to your investment plan.
* **Consider dollar-cost averaging (DCA)** to mitigate market volatility risks.

# Common Investment Scenarios & Questions

**Q: I'm located in the U.S., Canada, or the EU and new to investing. What platforms should I use?**

A: The best platform depends on your country and investment needs:

* **U.S.**: Fidelity, Charles Schwab, and Robinhood are popular for commission-free trading and strong research tools.
* **Canada**: Wealthsimple and Questrade offer user-friendly interfaces with low fees.
* **EU**: Interactive Brokers and eToro provide solid investment options with reasonable costs.

📌 **Tip:** Always compare fees, account types, and user experience before selecting a platform.

**Q: I'm currently invested in ""XYZ."" Where should I diversify?**

A: Diversification depends on your current holdings and financial goals:

* If you’re **heavily invested in U.S. stocks** (e.g., S&P 500 ETFs like VOO or VTI), consider **adding international exposure** through VXUS (Total International Stock ETF) or VEU (FTSE All-World ex-US).
* If your portfolio is **stock-heavy**, introducing **bonds (e.g., BND, AGG)** can help balance risk and reduce volatility.
* Some investors allocate a portion to **real estate funds (REITs) or alternative assets** to further diversify.
* **Consider risk management**: Balancing high-growth stocks with more stable investments can help mitigate potential downturns.

📌 **Tip:** A well-balanced portfolio includes a mix of U.S. stocks, international stocks, and bonds tailored to your risk tolerance and time horizon.",156,https://www.reddit.com/r/investingforbeginners/comments/1ist2cl/evergreen_guide_how_to_start_investing_2025/,1739927808.0,Got_Curious,1ist2cl,advice_seeking

I'm expecting a huge raise towards start of next year and working on starting a small company on the side.  


My 80k are currently: 16k in crypto (ETH mainly), 10k in IBKR but currently liquid and the rest in cash. I'm planning on investing 50k in land in my country, build back an emergency fund before i move to the UK of 14k.   
  
Last year i decided to start investing for my retirement. I started with a 10K lump sum and was planning to add about 10K every 5 months once I get the hang of it. I put everything in VUAA (Irish domiciled) but then the tarifs and concerns over trade wars, Taiwan ... started so I cashed out after i made back my original investment. Had I left them my 10k would be around 11k now.   
  
  
How are people currently dealing with this? Am I being unreasonable to worry about a massive crash due to trade wars or actual wars? Should I go back to my plan, buy again with the 10k and add the 2k monthly to it?

Our only debt is house and student loans, but our emergency fund isn't crazy high. 

I contribute to my 401k at work enough to get the full match benefit, but I'm not maxed out by any means.

Being completely candid, I don't want to think about the stock market. I don't want to worry about buying and selling. I just want to have money automatically taken from my account (and/or paycheck) and not look at it for 20 years. I take the view that it doesn't super matter what the market does day to day, all that matters is how much money I have when I actually pull it out eventually. I really just want out of sight out of mind investment. 

I've considered apps like Acorn because I liked the round up feature. I've also thought about just making out my 401k once my husband is done with his PhD next year and we are making more.

Basically, I am asking if any of you fine people have advice for brainless investing. Even if the advice is: it's not actually possible/a good idea to try to invest brainlessly.

I would like to own a home but I want that in the next 5 years not 20. So more realistically starting retirement savings. 

•	⁠What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs?

Not willing to gamble my security or stay glued to my phone making trades so probably next 20 years. 

•	⁠What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?)

Risk tolerance is zero. I need to know it’s 100% safe or i absolutely will not do it. 

•	⁠What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors? Any other assets?)

No current holdings. So far it’s just too complicated for me to figure out. 

•	⁠Any big debts (include interest rate) or expenses?

No big debts. 

•	⁠And any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer.

investingforbeginners,savings rate,The Stock Market is Crashing...Here are some Do's and Don'ts,"Do Not Panic….Yet!

The stock market is experiencing a sharp downturn, sending shockwaves through investors’ portfolios. When fear takes over, it’s easy to make rash decisions that could have long-term financial consequences. But before you panic and hit the sell button, take a deep breath and consider your options carefully. A market crash doesn’t have to be a financial disaster—it can also present opportunities.

**What NOT to Do When the Market Crashes**

**1. Don’t Panic-Sell**

One of the biggest mistakes investors make during a market downturn is selling in a panic. It’s important to remember that until you sell your investments, your losses are only on paper. If you sell when prices are low, you lock in those losses permanently. Historically, the stock market has always recovered over time, meaning that holding on can often be the better choice.

**2. Don’t Try to Time the Market**

Timing the market—selling at the peak and buying at the bottom—sounds great in theory, but in practice, it’s nearly impossible. Even seasoned investors struggle to predict market movements accurately. Instead of trying to guess when the market will turn around, focus on long-term investment strategies.

**3. Don’t Abandon Your Investment Plan**

If you have a well-thought-out investment strategy, now is not the time to abandon it. Market downturns are part of the investing cycle. If your plan was built with long-term goals in mind, it should be resilient enough to weather market fluctuations.

**What TO Do When the Market Crashes**

**1. Stay Focused on the Long Term**

Market downturns are temporary, but solid investments grow over time. Historically, the stock market has always recovered and gone on to reach new highs. If you don’t need immediate access to your investments, staying the course is often the best approach.

**2. Look for Buying Opportunities**

A market crash isn’t just a time of uncertainty—it’s also a time of opportunity. Stocks are essentially on sale, and if you have cash available, you can buy quality investments at a lower cost. Investors who buy during downturns often see strong returns when the market rebounds.

**3. Reassess Your Portfolio**

Instead of reacting emotionally, take a step back and review your portfolio. Ask yourself: Are my investments still aligned with my financial goals? Are there better opportunities now that prices have dropped? Rebalancing your portfolio during a downturn can set you up for future gains.

**4. Continue Dollar-Cost Averaging**

If you’re investing regularly through a 401(k) or other investment plan, stick with your contributions. Dollar-cost averaging—investing a fixed amount at regular intervals—ensures that you’re buying stocks at varying prices over time, reducing the impact of volatility.

**5. Maintain an Emergency Fund**

One way to avoid panic-selling is to ensure you have an adequate emergency fund. If you have 3-6 months’ worth of living expenses saved, you won’t feel pressured to sell investments at a loss in order to cover unexpected expenses.

**The Pros and Cons of Selling During a Market Crash**

**Pros of Selling**

* If you need immediate cash for an emergency, selling may be necessary.
* Selling can help you cut losses on failing investments that may not recover.
* Some investors reallocate funds to safer investments if their risk tolerance has changed.

**Cons of Selling**

* You lock in losses instead of allowing time for recovery.
* You may miss out on the market rebound.
* Selling during a downturn can make it harder to re-enter the market at the right time.
* Taxes may be due: If you sell investments, you could trigger capital gains taxes, particularly if you’re selling assets held for less than a year. Short-term capital gains are taxed at higher rates than long-term gains, so it’s important to factor this into your decision.

**Final Thoughts**

A market crash can be unsettling, but it doesn’t have to derail your financial future. By staying calm, focusing on the long term, and taking advantage of buying opportunities, you can position yourself for success when the market recovers. Remember, investing is a marathon, not a sprint—and those who stay the course often come out ahead.",1163,https://www.reddit.com/r/investingforbeginners/comments/1j97zjz/the_stock_market_is_crashinghere_are_some_dos_and/,1741744075.0,FishingMaleficent498,1j97zjz,advice_seeking

investingforbeginners,savings rate,Crypto vs 401(k) for Retirement: A Simple Guide for Responsible Dads,"If you’re like me, juggling work, family, and trying to make smart money decisions, the whole idea of crypto vs. 401(k) for retirement can feel overwhelming. You want to protect your family’s future but don’t want to get caught up in hype or confusing jargon.

I’m a 40 yo-something dad who’s cautious but curious about crypto, and here’s a straightforward look at how these two options compare, no fluff, no fear, just facts.



What Is a 401(k), Really?

Most of us know a 401(k) as the retirement plan offered through work. It’s basically a long-term savings account where you and often your employer put money in, and it grows over time with investments like stocks and bonds.

Why it works for families like ours:

⦁	Stable and regulated: The government watches over it, so it’s generally safe.

⦁	Tax benefits: You often pay less tax now or when you withdraw later.

⦁	Easy to set up: Usually automatic deductions from your paycheck.

⦁	Long-term growth: Designed for decades-long investing with compound interest.



What About Crypto?

Cryptocurrency, like Bitcoin or Ethereum, is digital money with no banks and no physical bills. It’s still pretty new and can be volatile, meaning prices jump up and down a lot.

Why some see crypto as a retirement option:

⦁	Potential for high growth: Some coins have grown massively over a few years.

⦁	Diversification: Adding crypto can mix up your portfolio.

⦁	Access and control: You can manage your own coins without intermediaries.

But here’s the catch:

⦁	It’s risky: Prices can drop fast.

⦁	Less regulation: That means fewer protections if something goes wrong.

⦁	Learning curve: Wallets, keys, exchanges: it can feel technical.



So What Should You Consider?

1. Stability vs Growth Potential

Your 401(k) is built for steady, long-term growth. Crypto can be exciting but comes with big ups and downs. If you’re worried about losing what you’ve saved, 401(k) is safer.

2. Time and Effort

Managing a 401(k) mostly happens automatically. Crypto needs more hands-on attention and understanding to avoid mistakes.

3. Your Family’s Future

The goal is clear: a secure nest egg for retirement and maybe college costs. 401(k)s have a proven track record. Crypto is still new territory.



A Simple Way to Think About It

Imagine your retirement savings as a garden:

⦁	Your 401(k) is like planting an apple tree: slow to grow, steady, reliable fruit every year once mature.

⦁	Crypto is more like planting exotic seeds; some may bloom beautifully, while others might not grow at all.

Would you fill your entire garden with exotic seeds? Probably not. A mix makes sense if you’re comfortable with the risk



Crypto Advantages Over 401k

Let's not talk ignorantly, let's talk by looking at the data:

⦁	Most known cryptocurrencies return rates:

Bitcoin (BTC) (Released: January 2009) \~27,999,900% increase |

Ethereum (ETH) (Released: July 2015) \~599,900% increase |

Binance Coin (BNB) (Released: July 2017) \~739,900% increase |

Cardano (ADA) (Released: September 2017) \~4,050% increase |

Solana (SOL) (Released: March 2020) \~9,000% increase |

XRP (Ripple) (Released: 2012) \~59,000% increase |

Dogecoin (DOGE) (Released: December 2013) \~76,900% increase |

Polkadot (DOT) (Released: May 2020) \~28% increase |

Litecoin (LTC) (Released: October 2011) \~29,900% increase |

Chainlink (LINK) (Released: September 2017) \~22,700% increase



⦁	These returns are simply not achievable with a 401(k). Among these 10 well-known coins, only DOT fell short of expectations. Even ADA, which had one of the weakest performances on the list, still delivered a 40x return over 8 years that's a CAGR of 61.1%. By comparison, the average 401(k) CAGR over the same period is around 7–8%.

⦁	Buying every cryptocurrency right when it launches might be a bit of a miracle. But let’s see what would have happened if you had invested $100 in each of these 10 major cryptocurrencies five years after their launch:

[10 major cryptocurrencies five years after their launch](https://preview.redd.it/m1clzz4nw2hf1.png?width=1693&format=png&auto=webp&s=69934d3d7139ae2f1decebad4c35f208b80f4752)

⦁	Even if we bought each coin only 5 years after its launch, spending a total of $1,000, we would have more than $40,000. And keep in mind, we only bought once after 5 years and then held on. This doesn’t even include buying more during dips, selling at peaks, or staking.

⦁	Even if we exclude Bitcoin’s tremendous success, the remaining coins, even when bought 5 years after their launch date, have an approximate CAGR of 32.1% While a 401(k) yields around 8%, even Warren Buffett with his superior genius has achieved about a 20% CAGR, yet we, in complete ignorance, simply buying and holding, managed to earn 32% CAGR (even when pushing all conditions to the limit).

What Can You Do Now?

• Allocate more time to crypto than you do to your 401(k). Increasing your knowledge about 	crypto leads to increased profits.

• If curious about crypto, start small and only with money you can afford to lose. However, as you learn more, consider directing more funds toward it.

• Focus on learning the basics at your own pace without rushing.

• Avoid hype, influencer hype, and “get rich quick” promises.

I (M-26) a student graduating with my bachelor’s degree this July through a joint Germany/France program. I recently secured a full-time job (in Germany) with a net monthly income of €1,800. While I’m not new to investing, I’m now trying to build a long-term and consistent investment strategy.
Here’s a quick breakdown of my monthly plan:
- Rent: max €450

- Food & Lifestyle: €200

- ETF Investments: €200

- Emergency Fund Savings: €900

- Pocket Money & Support for Family: €50

Background

I’m single, with minimal lifestyle expenses (I reuse, recycle, and avoid flashy living).

I plan to pursue a distance learning Master’s in the coming year or two.

I’m originally from West-Africa and do have family financial responsibilities back home.

I’ve been investing since August last year — initially in single stocks (some wins, some losses), but now I’ve shifted focus to ETFs after learning more about them.

Currently holding:

- Vanguard S&P 500 ETF – €1,400 (+€21.5 return)

- iShares S&P 500 Consumer Discretionary Sector ETF – €559 (+3.79% return)

- Still holding some Tesla stock from my earlier stock-picking phase (will sell soon).

 - Current life savings: 3000€ (excluding above etfs) 

My Questions
- Is €200/month enough to invest in ETFs, or should I aim for €300 and cut back a little more from Emergency funds??

- Which ETFs would you recommend for someone investing consistently over 4+ years?

- Should I also consider EU-based ETFs, especially since I live in Germany, or just stick with U.S.-focused ones like the S&P 500?


Any other general advice on how to build long-term financial freedom and break out of generational poverty (as someone supporting family back home)?--- Currently planning to use my free time to create Notebooks and put on Amazon KDP

I’d really appreciate any honest feedback, strategy suggestions, or even criticism. Happy to answer any follow-up questions for clarity. Thanks a lot in advance

If I wanted to invest around $500/month, which would be a better investment? Are there other options I'm unaware of?

I don't have a big chunk of cash, but I want to be able to save at least something to leave my kids other than an insurance policy.

investingforbeginners,saving for retirement,Advice needed: Saving for retirement or building accessible wealth?,"I’m in my mid-20s and currently planning to get married soon. Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot more about my future and financial planning. I started contributing to retirement funds a couple of years ago, but recently, I’ve been finding it hard to prioritize putting money into accounts I can’t touch until retirement age.

Instead, I’ve been considering the advantages of saving for the short term and investing in things that can help me build wealth now. For example, I’d like to have the flexibility to use my money before retirement, potentially for opportunities like real estate or regular brokerage accounts (still taking advantage of compound interest) that could better prepare me for the future.

I understand the obvious tax advantages of Roth accounts, but I’m wondering if anyone has thoughts on this approach. Is focusing more on flexible investments in the short to medium term a better strategy? Or is it worth continuing to prioritize retirement accounts despite the long time horizon?

I’d love to hear your perspectives, especially if you’ve faced similar decisions or have advice on balancing these priorities.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/investingforbeginners/comments/1ias54r/advice_needed_saving_for_retirement_or_building/,1737929772.0,No_Accountant_6420,1ias54r,advice_seeking
investingforbeginners,saving for retirement,My mom is 60 and has all her savings in a regular savings account,"My mom works at a small bakery and has been putting every extra dollar into a regular savings account for the past 15 years. She has about $45k saved, but it’s just sitting there earning basically nothing, and she thinks investing is too risky. She wants to retire around 65 but doesn’t have any other retirement savings or a pension.

I want to help her, but i don’t want to push her into something she doesn’t understand. Would putting some of it into a high-yield savings or CDs make sense as a first step? Or should i gently try to show her index funds so at least her money can grow a bit while she still has time? I don’t want to see her working at the bakery forever.

investingforbeginners,saving for retirement,Retirement investing - S&P500,"Is my plan of investing in the s&p 500 for the next 30 years for a retirement fund dumb? for context, this is my personal investing account, i dont have a roth, i dont have a 401k (my employer does not contribute) and i like the idea of being in complete control of my own investing account, i've only really been investing for about 2 years and have around $30k in my portfolio, so i am pretty early on in my journey - i guess my question is what am i missing out on, tax savings with a 401k probably? what else, and at what cost. I think i am subconsciously holding on to the hope that my portfolio turns into generational wealth before retirement age and i can cash out early, i know this isnt likely to happen by only investing in the S&P but i plan to take on more risk once i can see the effects of compound interest, i suspect around the $100k mark.

investingforbeginners,50/30/20 rule,Can Sofi Reach $25?,"# SoFi Technologies (SOFI) Next 5 Years

**Growth Prospects:** SoFi is executing on a broad multi-product strategy. It reported record *member* growth (34% YoY to 10.1M in Q4 2024) and record *product* growth (34% YoY). Its offerings span lending (student, personal, mortgages, credit card), banking (deposit accounts via SoFi Money), and investing. In Q4 2024, fee-based revenue (mainly from banking and technology services) hit a record **$289M** (+63% YoY). reflecting growth in high-ROE, capital-light segments. SoFi’s “Financial Services Productivity Loop” – using lending profits to acquire deposit/investment customers – appears to be working: products per customer rose to 12.7M financial services products (deposits, accounts, etc.) by end-2024. Management expects \~2.8M new members in 2025 (28% growth). SoFi is also expanding its tech platform (Galileo) – recently winning major contracts (e.g. U.S. Treasury payment card program) – which diversifies revenue. The company has signaled interest in re-launching crypto trading and other features once “regulatory clarity” arrives (CEO Noto has said SoFi wants to offer crypto/blockchain products across its business lines). In sum, SoFi’s addressable market is large (many hundreds of millions of U.S. consumers for loans, banking, investing) and its rapid member/product growth suggests significant room to run if it can sustain execution.

**Profitability & Margins:** SoFi’s GAAP net margin turned positive (\~18.6% in 2024), but this was boosted by non-recurring tax benefits. On a normalized basis, adjusted net margins are slimmer (\~8–9%). However, adjusted EBITDA margins are healthy – for Q1 2025 adjusted EBITDA was 27% of revenue. SoFi’s loan default rates have improved (Q4 2024 personal loan 90-day delinquency 0.55%), which bodes well for future credit costs. Overall, profitability is rising as SoFi crosses scale, and management is targeting sustained profitability: they raised 2025 EPS guidance to \~$0.27–0.28.

**Management & Strategy:** CEO Anthony Noto (former Twitter/Citi executive) has emphasized innovation and brand-building. He declared “2024 was SoFi’s best year ever” – new records in *revenue, profit, members, and products* – and is raising guidance. Strategy highlights include shifting mix toward high-ROE businesses (banking services, tech platform) and vertically integrating product offerings (lending fuels deposits and investing). SoFi’s management has proven it can scale rapidly while moving to profitability, but execution must continue: they plan to roll out new credit products, expand into auto and crypto markets (once permitted), and grow partnerships (e.g. BlackRock robo-advisor). The board and exec team are experienced, and insider ownership (Noto holds stock) aligns incentives.

**Competitive Position & Risks:** SoFi faces competition from traditional banks, fintechs, and online brokers. Key peers:

* *Affirm (AFRM)* – a BNPL specialist. Affirm’s revenue growth has been strong (\~45–50% YoY) but it remains net-loss (narrowed in 2024). Its focus on point-of-sale credit competes with some SoFi lending products. Upcoming BNPL regulations (CFPB) could impact Affirm and similar players.
* *Block (SQ)* – Incumbent payments giant with Cash App and Square. Block is far larger (\~$29B mkt cap) but is growing single-digit (FY24 revenue +10%). Block is profitable (FY24 adj. EPS $3.37) and expanding financial services (savings, loans) – a formidable, well-capitalized competitor.
* *Robinhood (HOOD)* – trading app-turned-fintech. Robinhood’s Q4/2024 net revenue soared 115% to $1.01B (full-year $2.95B) and it swung to net profit ($1.41B in 2024) mainly on crypto and one-time tax benefits. While Robinhood’s core is investing/trading (different users), it competes in deposits and messaging of fintech. Robinhood’s rapid growth (account funding, deposits, AUC all surging shows consumer appetite for digital finance.
* *Others:* PayPal, LendingClub, Upstart, Chime (private), and banks are all vying for the same customers. SoFi’s broad product suite and aggressive marketing give it an edge, but cross-selling all products remains a challenge.

Regulatory risk is notable. SoFi’s OCC-approved bank charter (SoFi Bank) brings oversight: the OCC explicitly noted SoFi will be “subject to comprehensive supervision…and the full panoply of bank regulations”. This caps aggressive risk-taking (e.g. no crypto business for the bank) and requires strong capital. On the upside, bank status lets SoFi fund loans with deposits at scale (improving margins). Interest rate policy is a double-edged sword: higher rates (Fed funds \~5%) boost SoFi’s interest income on loans/deposits, but may dampen loan demand (refinancings, mortgages) and raise default rates. A recession or credit crunch could hurt all fintech credit businesses. Inflation and economic growth forecasts (slowdown to \~2% GDP in 2025) suggest moderate consumer credit growth. Overall, macro is neutral-to-slightly-challenging.

**Analyst Sentiment & Valuation:** Consensus is cautious. SoFi’s Wall Street rating is roughly *“Hold”*. and the average 1-year target (\~$11.60) implies limited upside from current \~$12–13. Analysts acknowledge strong growth but note high valuation. Currently SoFi trades around 20–25× adjusted 2024 EPS (or \~40× GAAP EPS) – a rich multiple for a still-maturing fintech. By comparison, Block trades \~14× forward earnings (FY25 guidance \~ $2.1B op income on $10.2B revenue)and Robinhood \~30× (based on 2024 EPS $1.56). Affirm is not profitable (negative P/E). To justify a future $25 price, SoFi must both grow earnings and sustain a high multiple.

**Technical Analysis:** SOFI has been volatile. It peaked near **$25.78** in Feb 2021, then plunged to \~$6 by late 2022 amid the crypto/tech selloff. It bottomed \~6.0 in Oct 2022 and has since rallied into 2024, trading \~12–15 in 2024. Recent trend: price has reclaimed its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, suggesting bullish momentum (current 50DMA \~$12.4, 200DMA \~$11.1. Short-term support is around $11–12 (seen in early 2025). Resistance appears near $14–15 (previous highs in summer 2024), then around $18 (2024 intra-year high), and the all-time high $25. Technical indicators are mixed: MACD is near neutral/bearish (slightly negative) but short-term EMAs are below price (a bullish sign). Trading volume has been moderate, with no clear head-and-shoulders or double-top pattern. In sum, the chart shows a base near $6–7 and a multi-month uptrend off that bottom, but a clear break above $18–20 would be needed to embolden bulls.

**Peer Chart Patterns:** (Briefly) Block (SQ) chart has similar dips in 2022 and recovery into 2024, but broke down again in late 2024 on earnings. Robinhood (HOOD) saw a massive spike late 2024 (due to crypto/news) then retraced. Affirm (AFRM) chart is still below its 2021 highs and looks rangebound. Overall, fintech charts have been volatile and driven by news/cycles.

# Conclusion: Path to $25

To reach $25 in 5 years (roughly double today’s \~$12), SoFi needs *both* continued business growth **and** multiple expansion. Scenarios that could make $25 plausible:

* **Sustained high growth:** If SoFi maintains \~25–30% annual revenue growth (driven by new members/products and market share gains), 2029 revenues could be \~$7–8B. If it also achieves healthy profitability (say mid-teens EBIT margins), EPS could be $1.00–$1.20 by 2029 (vs \~$0.06 GAAP in Q1 2025). At today’s \~40× GAAP P/E, that still gets only \~$40 price – so even that is optimistic. More realistically, if it trades at \~25× EPS on \~$1.00, price \~25. So the math requires both far higher profit and a premium multiple.
* **Profit transformation:** Eliminating one-time distortions and continuing cost discipline, SoFi’s GAAP EPS could climb quickly (guidance is $0.27–0.28 for 2025 vs $0.39 for 2024). If this growth accelerates and the company attains sustained net margins, Wall Street might re-rate the stock. Meeting or beating guidance consistently is critical.
* **Market Sentiment:** Fintech hype could return (e.g. crypto bull run, digital banking boom, AI-driven finance products) that re-ignites investor appetite. Strategic wins (like global expansion or big acquisitions) could also boost valuation.
* **Macro Tailwinds:** A stronger economy with low default rates, stable high interest rates (boosting NII), and favorable regulations (BNPL rules favorable to SoFi’s model, crypto/trading allowed) would help.

Downside factors that would keep SoFi below $25: slower growth (e.g. revenue <15% CAGR as competition heats up), loss of profitability momentum, adverse rate/cycle changes, or general market derating of tech/fintech valuations. Also, if customers stick with incumbents or SoFi fails to cross-sell as planned, revenue growth may stall.

**Outlook:** SoFi has many strengths – scale in fintech, growing diversified business, improving profitability, and a clear growth strategy. However, reaching $25 requires roughly 2× the current market capitalization (from \~$14B to \~$28B) in an industry where peers are growing more slowly. It’s plausible **if** SoFi continues its torrid growth and executes flawlessly (members hitting \~20M+, capturing market share in multiple segments). But anything less than near-best-case execution makes $25 look ambitious. In neutral scenarios, $25 would require a valuation well above today’s norms. In summary, $25 by 2030 is **possible but challenging**: it will likely require continued revenue growth at 25–30%+ and a premium P/E (20–30×) driven by strong execution. Investors should watch growth metrics (members, cross-sell, revenue mix) and profitability improvements – if these **all** trend upward, the stock could approach $25. If growth falters or costs rise, the stock may remain closer to the $10–15 range.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/investingforbeginners/comments/1kh19gc/can_sofi_reach_25/,1746634261.0,InvestingforEveryone,1kh19gc,not_advice_seeking

My personal thoughts:  This is a very interesting company , that's fairly new to the game. They went live via SPAC on Sep 2023 . But been around since 2015 . It's not some hype company riding the coattails of the AI craze . Roadzen complete suite of products is directly tethered to the Auto Insurance never ending story.  It's been on a slow downtrend since it's listing on NASDAQ, due to an extremely high evaluation of about $683m . And some recent Revenue woes because the U.K suspended its market unrelated to Roadzen however. Which should be rectified this year. With all that being said, they have alot of positive momentum to capitalize in 2025 & beyond.  I'm not chart guy but it's bottomed out around the $1 + - range , and looking to consolidate to move up. Low volume has been keeping it in a nice buy opportunity rn me thinks

Rohan Malhotra is a very bright & influential CEO , got his Masters in Electrical & Computer Engineering at Carnegie .  That's no easy feat & very impressive in my opinion  . And it's not just him but the entire board consist of A+ players

Oh and the CEO already has a boatload of shares holding some personally but mostly through various LLC's / Limited  . You can check exactly on SEC filings ownership disclosures  . But the man still buys shares here and there on the open market. Granted it's not huge numbers, but a positive sign nonetheless.

This inclusion is expected to boost awareness among institutional investors and improve the company's visibility. That is HUGE , pretty much every ETF that follow those index's buys or holds shares of RDZN . So that along with big ownerships %'s on both sides , keeps a huge piece of the pie bought up already. Hence the very small float of 36m for a Company with the market cap of 84m . That's an amazing ratio mind you , usually something like that happens artificially via a Reverse Split . But this was done organically

Mantis, xClaim, Via, Sureprice, and StrandD, Mixtape ai .Also on the mobility side of things especially commercial vehicles with the DriveBuddy AI for driver awareness, safety regulations, & accident prevention**

While traditional driver scoring models focus on isolated risks such as hard braking and speeding, drivebuddyAI’s Cognitive Assessment of Risk for Drivers (CARD) system takes a comprehensive and context-aware approach. It analyzes simultaneous hazards like drowsiness, collision warnings, seatbelt or phone-use violations, and environmental factors such as road conditions and weather. A clustering algorithm correlates compounding issues—for example, speeding on wet roads or drowsy driving during late hours—to yield real-time risk insights. Through personalized coaching and a rewards-and-penalties framework, the system fosters safer driving behaviors and supports fleet operators and insurers with risk-based premium calculations and proactive safety interventions.

Our experience with thousands of drivers generating over a billion kilometers of driving data has proven the need for an integrated approach that unifies multiple data streams into a contextual algorithm.  The net result of our comprehensive system approach has delivered up to 70% reduction in accidents,” said Nisarg Pandya, CEO at drivebuddyAI. “By precisely weighting each risk factor and providing real-time insights, we empower fleets to proactively enhance safety and efficiency.”

Roadzen’s DrivebuddyAI also recently became the first system to receive Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) validation under India’s AIS 184 standard—expected to be mandatory for all six million commercial vehicles in India by 2026—making it the only fully compliant driver safety system available for automotive OEMs.

“Embodied AI—or agents that perceive, learn, and make decisions while operating in the real world—represents an incredible opportunity to transform both insurance and mobility, industries that exceed a trillion dollars in annual spend. Every driver benefits from improved road safety, while insurers gain more precise control of underwriting through our CARD scoring algorithm. We see this as a win-win for everyone. Our innovations show that Roadzen remains peerless in this vertical, and we plan to continue innovating for sustained growth,” said Rohan Malhotra, Founder and CEO of Roadzen.

The regulations, expected to be adopted within the next 30 days, mandate the installation of Driver Drowsiness and Attention Warning Systems under AIS 184, along with other critical road safety features. Roadzen’s DrivebuddyAI is the first and only system validated by the testing authority to meet the AIS 184 standard. The new regulations require Driver Drowsiness and Attention Warning Systems, Blind Spot Information Systems, and Moving Off Information Systems for both passenger and goods-carrying commercial vehicles in the country. These rules apply to new vehicle models under categories N2, N3, M2, and M3 starting April 1, 2026, and existing models beginning October 1, 2026, covering an estimated 500,000+ new vehicles produced annually and 500,000 vehicles to be retrofitted-a market estimated at $200M in annual revenues, with Roadzen’s DrivebuddyAI as the sole compliant solution at this stage.

1. **AIM (Alternative Investment Market)** The Alternative Investment Market (AIM) is a sub-market of the London Stock Exchange designed for smaller, growing companies. Established in 1995, AIM allows these companies to raise capital with fewer regulatory requirements than the main market, making it attractive to new or innovative businesses. It serves as a platform for early-stage companies to gain access to public investment and provides investors with the opportunity to invest in high-growth potential firms. However, AIM-listed stocks can be more volatile and carry higher risk compared to stocks on the main market due to lower liquidity and less stringent listing requirements.
2. **Accumulation Units** Accumulation units are units in a fund where any income generated (such as dividends or interest) is reinvested back into the fund, rather than paid out to investors as cash. This reinvestment boosts the value of each unit, allowing investors to benefit from compound growth. Accumulation units are ideal for long-term investors who are looking to grow their investment over time, as opposed to income units, which pay out generated income regularly. They are often found in funds like pensions and ISAs, where tax-efficient growth is advantageous.
3. **Active Fund Management** Active fund management is an investment approach where fund managers actively select and trade securities to try to outperform a specific market index. In the UK, active fund managers research and analyse market conditions, individual company performance, and macroeconomic factors to make informed decisions about which stocks or bonds to buy, hold, or sell. This approach contrasts with passive management, which merely seeks to replicate an index. Active management can potentially lead to higher returns, but it also comes with higher fees and risks, as there is no guarantee of outperforming the index.
4. **Advisory Broker** An advisory broker is a type of stockbroker who provides investment advice to clients but does not make decisions on their behalf. Advisory brokers in the UK typically offer recommendations based on market research and analysis, helping clients decide which stocks or funds to buy or sell. This service is particularly useful for investors who want professional guidance while retaining control over their portfolios. Advisory brokerage services come with fees, which may be charged per trade or as a percentage of assets managed.
5. **Alpha** In investing, alpha represents the excess return of an investment relative to the return of a benchmark index, such as the FTSE 100. It is a key metric for evaluating the performance of fund managers, as a positive alpha indicates that the manager has added value beyond the market’s overall return. For example, if a fund’s return is 8% and the benchmark index returns 5%, the fund’s alpha would be +3%. Alpha is often used in conjunction with other metrics, like beta, to assess both performance and risk.
6. **Alternative Investments** Alternative investments refer to asset classes other than traditional stocks, bonds, and cash. In the UK, popular alternative investments include private equity, hedge funds, commodities, and real estate. These investments are often less correlated with traditional markets, which can provide diversification benefits within a portfolio. However, alternative investments can be complex, less liquid, and often require a longer investment horizon, making them suitable for experienced investors looking to enhance portfolio resilience or seek higher returns.
7. **Annual General Meeting (AGM)** The Annual General Meeting (AGM) is a yearly meeting held by a UK company, where shareholders gather to discuss the company’s performance, financial statements, and strategic direction. During an AGM, shareholders can vote on important matters, such as the appointment of board members, dividend payouts, and executive compensation. AGMs provide transparency and allow shareholders to hold company management accountable, making it a crucial event for investors in publicly listed UK companies.
8. **Annual Management Charge (AMC)** The Annual Management Charge (AMC) is a fee that investors pay to fund managers for managing an investment fund. In the UK, the AMC is typically expressed as a percentage of the fund’s total assets and is deducted annually. For example, a fund with an AMC of 1% will charge £10 per £1,000 invested per year. This fee covers administrative costs, research, and fund management expertise. While AMCs are standard, high charges can erode returns over time, so investors often look for funds with low AMCs to maximise net gains.
9. **Arbitrage** Arbitrage involves the simultaneous buying and selling of the same asset in different markets to exploit price discrepancies. For example, a UK investor might buy shares of a company listed on both the London Stock Exchange and a foreign exchange, selling the shares in the market where they’re priced higher. Arbitrage opportunities are often short-lived due to market efficiency, but sophisticated investors, such as hedge funds, use complex strategies and technology to identify and act on these opportunities quickly.
10. **Asset Allocation** Asset allocation is the process of dividing investments among different asset classes, such as equities, bonds, and cash, to balance risk and reward based on an investor’s financial goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance. In the UK, asset allocation is a fundamental strategy for portfolio management, as each asset class has different risk and return characteristics. For example, equities tend to offer higher returns but come with higher volatility, while bonds are generally safer but provide lower returns.
11. **At-the-Money (ATM)** At-the-money (ATM) refers to an options contract where the strike price is equal to the current market price of the underlying asset. For example, if a FTSE 100 option has a strike price of 7,500 and the index is trading at 7,500, the option is considered ATM. ATM options are often more sensitive to market movements, making them popular in short-term trading strategies due to their higher gamma, or rate of change in delta.
12. **Authorised Corporate Director (ACD)** In the UK, an Authorised Corporate Director (ACD) is the company responsible for managing an open-ended investment company (OEIC). The ACD oversees the day-to-day operations, compliance, and administration of the fund, ensuring that it adheres to regulations set by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). ACDs are pivotal in the UK’s fund management industry as they provide investors with assurance that the fund is professionally managed and compliant with regulatory standards.
13. **Authorised Fund** An authorised fund in the UK is an investment fund that has been approved by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) for marketing to retail investors. Authorised funds, such as OEICs and unit trusts, are subject to regulatory oversight, offering investors certain protections. These funds must follow strict rules on transparency, asset holding, and reporting, making them a popular choice for retail investors looking for regulated investment products.
14. **Average Daily Volume (ADV)** Average Daily Volume (ADV) refers to the average number of shares traded per day in a specific security over a set period, such as 30 days. For UK investors, a higher ADV indicates greater liquidity, making it easier to buy or sell shares without significantly affecting the price. ADV is an important metric when assessing a stock’s liquidity, volatility, and potential trading costs, especially for large institutional investors.
15. **Ask Price** The ask price, also known as the offer price, is the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for a security. In UK stock trading, the ask price is part of the bid-ask spread, which represents the difference between what buyers are willing to pay (bid) and what sellers are asking. The spread is influenced by factors like market liquidity, demand, and trading volume, with tighter spreads indicating a more liquid market.
16. **Accumulated Dividend** Accumulated dividends are unpaid dividends on cumulative preferred shares, which must be paid to shareholders before any dividends can be distributed to common shareholders. In the UK, accumulated dividends are common in preferred stock agreements, where companies must prioritise these dividends during profitable periods. This type of arrangement is favourable for preferred shareholders, as it guarantees that they will eventually receive their owed dividends, even if distributions are delayed.
17. **Active Share** Active share is a measure of how much a fund’s holdings differ from its benchmark index. In the UK, a high active share indicates that a fund manager is making distinct investment choices, rather than simply tracking the index. For example, a FTSE 100 tracker fund would have low active share, whereas a UK small-cap fund with unique stock selections would have a high active share. Active share is an important metric for investors seeking fund managers who deliver alpha through active management.
18. **Averaging Down** Averaging down is an investment strategy where an investor buys more of a stock as its price falls, reducing the average cost per share. In the UK, this strategy is commonly used in long-term investing, especially if the investor believes the stock will recover over time. While averaging down can improve the potential for profit if the stock price rebounds, it also increases exposure to a potentially underperforming asset.
19. **Alpha Generation** Alpha generation refers to the process of creating returns that exceed a market benchmark. In the UK, fund managers aim to generate alpha by identifying undervalued stocks, exploiting market inefficiencies, or using specialised knowledge. Alpha generation is often the goal of active management and is considered a measure of investment skill, though achieving consistent alpha can be challenging due to market competition and efficiency.
20. **Alternative Investment Fund (AIF)** An Alternative Investment Fund (AIF) is a collective investment scheme not regulated as a conventional fund, such as private equity or hedge funds. In the UK, AIFs are typically used by high-net-worth individuals and institutional investors seeking diversification or higher returns. The UK’s AIFMD (Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive) provides a regulatory framework for these funds, ensuring transparency and risk management, although AIFs still tend to carry higher risk than traditional investments.
21. **Annual Allowance** The annual allowance is the maximum amount that can be contributed to a pension each year with tax relief in the UK. As of recent tax years, the allowance has been capped, with reductions applying to high earners. Contributing within this allowance provides tax-efficient growth, and exceeding it could trigger a tax charge. This limit encourages long-term retirement savings while maintaining tax benefits.
22. **Accumulated Dividend** Accumulated dividends refer to dividends on cumulative preferred stock that have not yet been paid out by the company. In the UK, if a company has cumulative preferred shares, it is obliged to pay any accumulated dividends to preferred shareholders before any dividends are paid to common shareholders. This ensures that preferred shareholders receive their promised returns, particularly in financially difficult times when dividend payments might be delayed.
23. **Analyst Rating** An analyst rating is an assessment provided by investment analysts on the expected performance of a stock, typically expressed as “buy,” “hold,” or “sell.” In the UK, ratings from financial analysts are widely followed by investors to gauge a stock’s future performance. Analysts conduct detailed financial analysis, considering factors like company earnings, market trends, and competitive positioning, to guide their recommendations.
24. **AIM Rule 26** AIM Rule 26 is a regulatory requirement mandating that companies listed on the AIM market make certain information available on their websites. This includes details on business operations, board composition, corporate governance, and financial reports. Rule 26 ensures transparency for investors by making essential information readily accessible, which is particularly important given AIM’s focus on smaller, potentially higher-risk companies.
25. **All-Share Index** The All-Share Index is a market index that tracks the performance of all eligible companies listed on the London Stock Exchange’s main market. It is one of the broadest measures of UK market performance and includes companies of varying sizes across multiple sectors. Investors often use the All-Share Index as a benchmark to gauge the overall health of the UK economy and to measure individual portfolio performance against a comprehensive market indicator.
26. **Annualised Return** Annualised return represents the average yearly return on an investment over a specific period, expressed as a percentage. It is useful for UK investors to compare returns on investments held for different durations. For example, an investment yielding 20% over two years has an annualised return of approximately 9.54%. This metric provides a standardised measure of performance, allowing investors to assess and compare investments more accurately.
27. **Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT)** Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) is a multi-factor asset pricing model that explains the expected return on an asset based on various economic factors. Unlike the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), APT considers multiple sources of market risk. In the UK, APT is used by analysts to understand and predict asset returns based on factors such as inflation, interest rates, and economic growth, offering a sophisticated approach to asset pricing.
28. **Ask Price** The ask price, also known as the offer price, is the lowest price at which a seller is willing to sell a security. In the UK stock market, the ask price is part of the bid-ask spread and reflects the current market supply for a particular stock. The spread between the bid and ask prices can indicate a security’s liquidity, with narrower spreads often suggesting high liquidity and ease of trading.
29. **Asset Turnover** Asset turnover is a financial ratio that measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate revenue. For UK investors, a high asset turnover ratio indicates that a company is effectively using its assets to drive sales, which is a positive sign for operational efficiency. It is calculated by dividing a company’s revenue by its total assets, and it varies by industry, with retailers typically having higher ratios than capital-intensive industries.
30. **Attribution Analysis** Attribution analysis is a performance measurement technique that assesses how a fund manager’s asset allocation and stock selection choices contribute to the fund’s overall return relative to a benchmark. In the UK, this analysis helps investors understand whether a fund manager’s decisions are adding value, making it a valuable tool for evaluating actively managed funds.
31. **Average Daily Volume (ADV)** Average Daily Volume (ADV) is the average number of shares traded daily over a set period. For UK stocks, ADV provides insights into a stock’s liquidity, as high daily volume suggests easier buying and selling without major price changes. UK investors use ADV to evaluate the level of market activity in a stock, which is particularly useful for high-frequency trading or large transactions.
32. **Asset Allocation Fund** An asset allocation fund is a mutual fund that diversifies investments across asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and cash, to achieve a specific investment objective. In the UK, asset allocation funds are popular for providing balanced exposure and reducing volatility, making them ideal for investors seeking diversified portfolios managed by professional fund managers.
33. **Authorised Unit Trust** An authorised unit trust is a UK-based investment fund structured as a unit trust and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). These funds are popular with UK investors for pooling their money to invest in a diversified portfolio of assets. Authorised unit trusts must adhere to strict regulatory standards, ensuring transparency and investor protection.
34. **Average Maturity** Average maturity refers to the weighted average time until the bonds in a fixed-income portfolio mature. For UK investors in bond funds, average maturity indicates the fund’s sensitivity to interest rate changes. Longer average maturities mean higher sensitivity to interest rate movements, affecting the portfolio’s value as rates change.
35. **Anchor Investor** An anchor investor is an institutional investor who purchases a large portion of shares during an IPO, typically to boost confidence in the offering. In the UK, anchor investors play a key role in securing early interest in IPOs, helping to stabilise the offering by showing commitment to the stock, which can attract further interest from retail and institutional investors.
36. **At-the-Market Offering (ATM)** An at-the-market offering allows a company to issue new shares on an as-needed basis at current market prices, rather than at a fixed price. In the UK, ATMs are less common but can be useful for companies needing flexible funding. This approach is advantageous for maintaining steady capital flows without the need for a large, one-time public offering.
37. **Active ETF** An active exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a type of ETF that is actively managed to outperform a benchmark index rather than passively tracking it. Although passive ETFs are more common in the UK, active ETFs are gaining popularity as they provide flexibility and potential for higher returns while offering the liquidity and low-cost benefits of traditional ETFs.
38. **Accumulation Index** An accumulation index measures the performance of a set of stocks assuming that dividends are reinvested rather than paid out. In the UK, indices like the FTSE All-Share Total Return Index act as accumulation indices. They provide a more accurate reflection of an investor’s returns if dividends are automatically reinvested, useful for long-term growth comparisons.
39. **Accretive Acquisition** An accretive acquisition occurs when a company’s earnings per share (EPS) increase due to an acquisition. In the UK, companies make accretive acquisitions to enhance shareholder value. Such acquisitions add value by increasing earnings or offering synergies, often leading to a favourable market reaction if the acquisition aligns well with strategic goals.
40. **Allotment** In the context of UK IPOs, an allotment refers to the allocation of shares to investors. The allotment process occurs when a company determines how many shares each investor receives based on demand. This is particularly relevant in oversubscribed IPOs, where some investors may receive fewer shares than requested due to high demand.
41. **Accelerated Book Build** An accelerated book build is a fast process by which a company raises capital through the issuance of shares. In the UK, accelerated book builds are commonly used for secondary offerings, allowing companies to issue shares quickly, usually overnight, to institutional investors. This process helps avoid prolonged exposure to market fluctuations and can secure funds efficiently.
42. **Allotment Letter** An allotment letter is a document provided to investors confirming the number of shares allocated to them in an IPO or new issue. In the UK, this letter is typically issued after the allotment process and serves as official confirmation of ownership, outlining the number of shares assigned and the price per share.
43. **Alpha Capture** Alpha capture refers to investment strategies designed to systematically capture alpha by exploiting inefficiencies. In the UK, hedge funds and institutional investors often use alpha capture models to gain excess returns over benchmarks. These strategies focus on identifying mispriced assets based on quantitative analysis and fundamental research.
44. **Acquisition Premium** The acquisition premium is the difference between the price paid for a company in an acquisition and its pre-acquisition market value. In the UK, acquisition premiums are common in mergers and acquisitions, where buyers pay more than the market price to gain control of a company, typically due to expected synergies or strategic advantages.
45. **Asset Swap** An asset swap is a financial arrangement where an investor exchanges the cash flows of one asset for another, usually involving a bond with a fixed rate swapped for a floating rate. In the UK, asset swaps are used in portfolio management to adjust interest rate exposure or enhance yields while maintaining credit exposure.
46. **Accumulation Phase** The accumulation phase is the period in which an investor builds up their assets, typically in preparation for retirement. In the UK, the accumulation phase is crucial for pension planning, where contributions are made to retirement accounts, and investments are allowed to grow over time to build a sufficient retirement fund.
47. **Appraisal Ratio** The appraisal ratio measures the performance of a portfolio manager by assessing their ability to generate alpha relative to unsystematic risk. In the UK, institutional investors use the appraisal ratio to evaluate fund managers’ skills, comparing risk-adjusted returns and isolating returns generated by active management rather than market movement.
48. **Average Price** The average price is the total cost of all purchases divided by the number of shares purchased. For UK investors, calculating the average price helps understand the average investment cost per share when buying stock in multiple transactions. This metric is useful in cost basis calculations for determining tax liability on capital gains.
49. **Attribution Report** An attribution report is a document that breaks down a fund’s returns and shows how each decision or factor contributed to performance. In the UK, fund managers produce attribution reports to provide transparency to investors, helping them understand the impact of specific investment decisions on overall fund returns.
50. **Asset Beta** Asset beta is a measure of the sensitivity of a company’s assets to market movements, reflecting only the firm’s operational risk without the impact of its capital structure. UK investors use asset beta to understand the intrinsic risk of a company’s assets, particularly in unlevered (debt-free) conditions.
51. **Allotment Advice** Allotment advice is the formal notice provided to investors about the quantity of shares allocated to them in a share issue. In the UK, this document is typically issued by brokers or the issuing company, providing confirmation of the shares received and instructions on when and how they will be credited to the investor’s account.
52. **At-the-Market (ATM) Order** An at-the-market (ATM) order is a type of trading order that is executed immediately at the best available current market price. In the UK, ATM orders are popular among investors who prioritise the speed of execution over specific pricing, particularly in volatile markets where rapid changes can affect prices.
53. **Automatic Execution** Automatic execution refers to the electronic process where trades are automatically placed and fulfilled without manual intervention. In the UK, many exchanges and trading platforms offer automatic execution, providing retail and institutional investors with efficient and rapid access to the markets.
54. **Active Risk** Active risk, also known as tracking error, measures the volatility of a portfolio’s returns relative to its benchmark. In the UK, active risk is often used to assess the degree to which a fund’s performance deviates from its benchmark due to active management decisions, with higher active risk indicating greater divergence.
55. **Accumulation Bond** An accumulation bond is a type of bond that pays interest by increasing the principal rather than making periodic interest payments. In the UK, accumulation bonds are popular among investors looking to defer income and reinvest earnings for long-term growth.
56. **Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD)** The Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD) is a European Union regulation governing the management of alternative investment funds in the UK and EU. It sets requirements for fund transparency, risk management, and investor protection. The AIFMD affects hedge funds, private equity, and other alternative investments operating in the UK.
57. **All Ordinaries Index (All Ords)** The All Ordinaries Index, or “All Ords,” is an index representing Australian stocks, often used in UK contexts for international market comparisons. Though it’s an Australian index, the All Ords is referenced by UK investors as it provides insights into global market trends and is an important benchmark for funds with exposure to Australian equities.
58. **Auction Market** An auction market is a trading environment where securities are bought and sold through an open bidding process. In the UK, the London Stock Exchange operates as an auction market during certain trading periods, setting prices based on supply and demand dynamics in a transparent manner.
59. **Adjusted Earnings** Adjusted earnings are earnings calculated by excluding one-off or unusual items that are not expected to recur. UK companies often report adjusted earnings to give investors a clearer view of ongoing performance, as one-off items, such as restructuring costs, can distort net profit figures.
60. **Annual Compound Growth Rate (ACGR)** The annual compound growth rate represents the yearly growth rate of an investment, factoring in the effects of compounding. In the UK, the ACGR is widely used by investors to evaluate investment performance over multiple years, providing a consistent metric for long-term growth assessment.
61. **Asset Protection Trust** An asset protection trust is a legal arrangement in the UK that protects assets from creditors and other claims. Often used by high-net-worth individuals, these trusts are structured to safeguard assets from risks such as legal disputes or business liabilities.
62. **Arbitrage Fund** An arbitrage fund is a type of fund that seeks to generate returns by exploiting pricing discrepancies in different markets or securities. In the UK, arbitrage funds are popular among hedge fund investors, who aim to take advantage of inefficiencies and mispricings in stocks, bonds, or derivatives.
63. **Adjusted Closing Price** Adjusted closing price is the closing price of a stock adjusted for events like dividends and stock splits. In the UK, adjusted closing prices provide a more accurate representation of a stock’s historical performance, accounting for corporate actions that would otherwise distort the price history.
64. **Algorithm** An algorithm is a set of rules or calculations designed to automate trading decisions. In the UK, algorithms are widely used in high-frequency trading, enabling traders to execute large volumes of trades based on pre-set criteria, with minimal human intervention.
65. **Active Trading** Active trading involves buying and selling securities frequently to capture short-term gains. In the UK, active traders focus on market timing and technical analysis, contrasting with passive investors who buy and hold. Active trading requires expertise and is often more suited to experienced investors due to higher transaction costs.
66. **Ask Size** Ask size refers to the number of shares a seller is willing to sell at the ask price. In the UK, ask size provides insights into the liquidity and demand for a stock. A larger ask size can indicate a willingness to sell significant shares at a given price, potentially affecting market perception, as larger ask sizes may signal selling pressure.
67. **Asset Coverage Ratio** The asset coverage ratio measures a company’s ability to cover its debt obligations with its assets. In the UK, this ratio is commonly used by investors and analysts to assess the financial health and risk level of highly leveraged companies. A higher asset coverage ratio suggests stronger financial stability and a greater ability to meet debt obligations.
68. **Accelerated Depreciation** Accelerated depreciation is an accounting method where an asset’s value is reduced more quickly in the initial years of ownership. In the UK, companies may use accelerated depreciation to lower taxable income, especially for equipment or machinery that loses value quickly. This practice benefits companies in capital-intensive industries, enabling faster cost recovery.
69. **Authorised Participant (AP)** An authorised participant (AP) is a financial institution responsible for creating and redeeming shares in an exchange-traded fund (ETF). In the UK, APs play a critical role in ETF liquidity, as they facilitate large-scale buying and selling to ensure the ETF’s price aligns with the value of its underlying assets, benefiting retail investors with accurate pricing.
70. **Auction Process** The auction process is a method for buying and selling securities through competitive bidding. In the UK, auctions are used in government bond sales and certain phases of the London Stock Exchange’s trading day. Auctions ensure fair pricing based on demand and supply, providing transparency for market participants.
71. **Adjusted Beta** Adjusted beta is a modified beta value that accounts for the tendency of a stock’s beta to regress towards the market average over time. In the UK, adjusted beta helps investors better understand a stock’s historical volatility and future risk compared to the overall market, which is particularly useful for assessing high or low beta stocks.
72. **Average Price Call Option** An average price call option is an options contract where the payoff depends on the average price of the underlying asset over a specified period. In the UK, this option type is used for volatility trading, allowing investors to benefit from average price movements rather than short-term spikes or drops, useful in managing risk in unpredictable markets.
73. **Anchor Point** In technical analysis, an anchor point is a reference point on a price chart, often used to identify trends and support or resistance levels. UK traders and analysts use anchor points to establish trends, aiding in decision-making by marking significant price movements or reversals that indicate potential entry or exit points.
74. **Amortised Cost** Amortised cost is the original cost of an asset adjusted for principal repayments and interest expenses. In the UK, amortised cost is commonly applied to debt instruments, particularly bonds, allowing investors to track the value of the bond over time as payments are made, rather than using the bond’s current market price.
75. **Arbitrage Opportunity** An arbitrage opportunity is a situation where an asset is priced differently across markets, allowing investors to buy low in one market and sell high in another. In the UK, arbitrage is a common strategy among hedge funds and institutional investors who leverage small price discrepancies in stocks, commodities, or currencies for profit.
76. **Annual Equivalent Rate (AER)** The Annual Equivalent Rate (AER) represents the interest rate on savings accounts or bonds, taking compounding into account. UK investors use the AER to compare interest-bearing accounts, as it standardises the return rate, allowing comparisons of products with different compounding frequencies, thus simplifying yield calculations.
77. **All Ordinaries Accumulation Index** The All Ordinaries Accumulation Index measures the performance of stocks listed on the Australian Stock Exchange, assuming reinvested dividends. UK investors reference this index for insights into the Australian market’s total return performance, particularly those with international portfolios that include Australian stocks or funds.
78. **Alpha Capture Program** An alpha capture program is a system that aggregates stock recommendations from analysts and converts them into an actionable trading strategy. In the UK, hedge funds and asset managers use alpha capture programs to systematically implement high-conviction investment ideas, aiming to achieve excess returns over the market or a benchmark.
79. **Accrued Dividend** Accrued dividend is a dividend that has been declared by a company but not yet paid to shareholders. In the UK, accrued dividends are accounted for by investors tracking income from dividend-paying stocks, ensuring they receive any declared payments due to them even if they haven’t been paid out by the end of a financial period.
80. **Adjusted Gross Income (AGI)** Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) is an individual’s total gross income minus specific deductions, used to determine tax liabilities. In the UK, a similar concept is known as “adjusted net income,” which influences tax bands and allowances. Investors calculate AGI to determine their eligibility for various tax reliefs and to assess overall tax efficiency.
81. **Analyst Consensus** Analyst consensus is the average opinion of financial analysts regarding a stock’s rating, often expressed as buy, hold, or sell. In the UK, analyst consensus provides a collective view of a stock’s future performance, helping investors make informed decisions by considering aggregated opinions from market experts.
82. **Anti-Dilution Clause** An anti-dilution clause protects investors from a reduction in their ownership percentage due to new stock issuance. In the UK, these clauses are often included in venture capital agreements, ensuring that early investors’ stakes are preserved even if new shares are issued at a lower valuation.
83. **Asset Turnover Ratio** The asset turnover ratio measures how effectively a company uses its assets to generate revenue, calculated as revenue divided by assets. UK investors and analysts use this ratio to assess a company’s operational efficiency, with higher ratios indicating that a company is effectively using its assets to drive sales.
84. **Attribution Analysis Report** An attribution analysis report is a breakdown of a portfolio’s returns, detailing how specific investment decisions contributed to overall performance. In the UK, such reports help fund managers and investors assess the effectiveness of stock selection, asset allocation, and market timing, providing insights into the drivers of portfolio returns.
85. **Adjusted Operating Profit** Adjusted operating profit is a measure of a company’s profitability after excluding one-off expenses and non-operational costs. In the UK, companies often report adjusted operating profit to give investors a clearer picture of their ongoing profitability, making it easier to compare performance across periods without distortions from exceptional items.
86. **Accumulation Phase Pension** The accumulation phase in a pension context refers to the period when an individual contributes to a pension scheme, building up funds for retirement. In the UK, this phase is critical for long-term retirement planning, allowing tax-efficient growth of contributions over time through compound interest.
87. **Accelerated Bookbuild Offering** An accelerated bookbuild offering is a fast-tracked process for issuing shares, typically to institutional investors. In the UK, companies use this method to raise capital quickly by issuing shares at a slight discount, which reduces exposure to market fluctuations and allows companies to secure funding efficiently.
88. **After-Tax Return** After-tax return is the return on an investment after accounting for taxes. In the UK, after-tax return is particularly important for investors in high tax bands, as it reflects the actual earnings on an investment, including capital gains and dividend tax implications, making it essential for evaluating tax efficiency in investment choices.
89. **Adjusted NAV (Net Asset Value)** Adjusted NAV is the net asset value of a fund or REIT adjusted for specific factors, such as debt or property valuations. In the UK, adjusted NAV provides a more accurate valuation for investment trusts and property funds, as it accounts for liabilities and assets that may not be included in standard NAV calculations.
90. **Active Share Management** Active share management is the degree to which a fund manager’s portfolio differs from its benchmark index. In the UK, high active share indicates a strategy where the fund manager is making substantial active investment choices, aiming to achieve outperformance rather than replicating the index, useful for investors seeking unique stock selections.
91. **Accumulation Option** An accumulation option in a fund or investment product allows income generated by the investment to be reinvested, rather than distributed. In the UK, accumulation options are popular among investors seeking long-term growth, as reinvested income compounds over time, enhancing the investment’s total value.
92. **Alpha Portfolio** An alpha portfolio is a segment of a portfolio designed to generate returns above the benchmark through active management. In the UK, alpha portfolios are typically managed by experienced fund managers who aim to identify mispriced assets or sectors to achieve higher returns, contrasting with beta portfolios, which track the market.
93. **Adjusted EBITDA** Adjusted EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortisation) is a metric used to measure a company’s core profitability, adjusted for non-recurring items. UK companies report adjusted EBITDA to provide a clearer view of operating performance, helping investors understand the company’s true earnings potential by removing volatile or one-time effects.
94. **Amortising Bond** An amortising bond is a bond that makes periodic principal repayments in addition to interest payments. In the UK, these bonds are typically used by organisations looking to gradually reduce debt over time. For investors, amortising bonds offer steady cash flow and reduce the risk of a large principal repayment at maturity.
95. **Arbitrage Pricing** Arbitrage pricing is the strategy of simultaneously buying and selling equivalent assets in different markets to profit from price differences. In the UK, arbitrage pricing is common in currency and stock trading, as it leverages market inefficiencies for profit, often involving complex strategies and quick execution.
96. **Accumulated Earnings** Accumulated earnings are the profits that a company retains rather than paying out as dividends. In the UK, companies with accumulated earnings may reinvest in business expansion or innovation. Accumulated earnings indicate financial health and potential growth opportunities, appealing to investors looking for companies reinvesting in their operations.
97. **Asset Backed Commercial Paper (ABCP)** Asset Backed Commercial Paper (ABCP) is a short-term debt instrument backed by physical assets, like receivables or mortgages. In the UK, ABCPs are used by corporations to access working capital. Investors in ABCP typically benefit from high liquidity and relatively low risk due to the asset backing.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/investingforbeginners/comments/1gvd3gw/investing_glossary_a_z_letter_a/,1732063894.0,DeepEnthusiasm614,1gvd3gw,not_advice_seeking

investingforbeginners,pay off debt,Paying off student debt or investing?,"Hey Reddit,

I’m in a bit of a dilemma and could use some advice from the community. I have a student loan with an interest rate of **5.95%**, and I’ve also got some money that I’m thinking about investing through my TFSA.

The question is: should I focus on **repaying my student loan** as quickly as possible, or could I invest the money instead?

I know that paying off the loan is always a good option because it gives a **guaranteed 5.95% return**, which is hard to argue against. On the other hand, the stock market is volatile and will never provide a perfectly accurate or consistent rate of return.

That said, I’m considering investing over the span of **approximately 8 months**, and I’ve been looking at options like portfolio management through **Wealthsimple** or **Questrade**. I’m wondering if it’s realistic to achieve an annual return that **beats 5.95% after taxes and fees**, especially in such a short timeframe.

Would love to hear your thoughts or experiences on:

1. Whether it’s better to prioritize debt repayment over investing in general.
2. Any success (or not) with getting higher returns through managed portfolios or DIY investing, especially in the short term.

Thanks in advance for your insights!",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/investingforbeginners/comments/1hvvydv/paying_off_student_debt_or_investing/,1736269031.0,Pitiful-Cranberry611,1hvvydv,advice_seeking

\* side note: part of my yearly gross income is my per diem-1099 job that yields a decent amount of cash. I plan on working more days these next couple months so that it can further speed up filling this HYSA and roth IRA

\- How much actual cash on hand (checking account) should I carry per month outside of my monthly basic needs (entertainment, mortgage, utilities, food, etc), if any at all? This seems like a silly question, but I just want to know if anyone carries just that ""extra cash"" outside of any investing/savings accounts.

\- As I've read that HSYA withdrawing has no penalty, do I just simply keep dumping my left over salary in there until I pull out when I need to pay for additional things like trips, vacations, fancy dinners with the GF?

\- Should I ever stop putting money into a HYSA after hitting that 6 months emergency fund? If not, I take it there's more interest or penalties of some sort for having too much money in an HYSA?

My husband and I are just really starting to crack down.. we have always been relatively good with managing our money and debt/paying off student loans (thank gosh) but I don’t want to wake up at 40 or 50 and have it be too late. So my question is.. how do you invest do you just set up an amount each month and it’s that simple?

I don’t even understand. Any help would be great!

Hi everyone,

I’m a 30-year-old, and I’ve managed to save $60,000. It’s currently sitting in a standard savings account, earning nothing in interest. 

 I’m not sure where to start when it comes to investing or growing my $.

I know the options: stocks, ETFs, mutual funds, GICs, real estate, etc. 

My goal is to grow this $, I’m okay with a moderate level of risk, but I also want to ensure I’m making choices that make sense for my situation.

Some additional context:
	•	I don’t have any debt (including credit cards or student loans).
	•	I have a stable job with a steady income and an emergency fund separate from the $60,000.
	•	I’m Canadian (so TFSA, RRSP, or similar tax-advantaged accounts are an option).
	•	I’m open to both short-term and long-term investment strategies.

If you were in my position, where would you start? Are there specific investments or strategies you’d recommend that are currently performing well or that would align with my goals? I’d love to hear what has worked for others or any tips on navigating this process!

Thanks in advance for your insights!

My ultimate goal is to save for a house, which as a single person living in the Boston metro area, feels like a distant dream. Still, I want to do more to invest and grow this chunk of change in the meantime. I also have some federal student loans that are in income based repayment that I could pay down/off. Please backseat my indecisive ass. Here's a breakdown of current assets and debts.

Income - $95,000/year, plus approx $15 - $20k/year profit from eBay sales.  
Checking - $5,000  
Money market - $45,000 @ .3%  
Savings account (emergency funds) - $8,000 @ .1% (lol)  
401k - $36,000 with performance of 11.3% (is that good?) I recently bumped withholding to 8.5% per paycheck.  

Debts - 3 direct student loans totaling ~$11,400  
$6,000 @ 4.05%  
$3,600 @ 3.40%  
$1,800 @ 3.86%  

I've paid off 4 other direct loans over the past two years. IBR is like $60 a month on these three, so I haven't been pressed to knock these out if I can do better investing. No credit card or other debt.  

Should I pay these loans off or put a big chunk on the S&P 500 and let it ride for the long term? Or bit of both? I'm just scared of the market shitting the bed right after buying in. I know you aren't supposed to time the market, but with all the tarrif and trade war talk on the horizon... Brain too smooth to know if/how the new administration will impact the market and economy. I was also looking at CDs at my bank, but rates are only 4.2% for 6-month, 3.76% for 11-month. At that point I should just pay off the loans, no?

Spend some money in building your income as investing in your own income is the longest investment. 6.

investingforbeginners,drowning in debt,Don't fall for the meme stocks: Stay AWAY from Opendoor!!! (NASDAQ: OPEN),"While I have seen a lot of hype on investing-related subreddits over the past few days on Opendoor (NASDAQ: OPEN), it is a TERRIBLE stock to buy, and I believe that it is essential to share crucial information about this company for everyone (especially beginners) to be aware about before they invest. Here are some reasons why you shouldn't buy Opendoor:

1. The premise of the company is flawed: For those of you who don't know, Opendoor is a real estate company which was the first to introduce the concept of iBuying to the housing market. The concept of having an algorithm evaluate the property prices by accounting for number of bedrooms, bathrooms, amenities, future value projections, and local housing market trends sounds enticing at first... if it wasn't for the fact that it has proven to be highly ineffective. Immediately after Opendoor entered the market, major competitors (Zillow, Realtor, Redfin) and smaller startups (with incredibly creative names such as Offerpad) scrambled to compete with it and established their respective iBuying departments. However, at the first sign of trouble for the US housing market after the post-pandemic surge, all other major players either closed their iBuying departments, went bankrupt, or have basically eliminated themselves from contention after numerous failures. Opendoor remains the last major company that uses this model, but you can already see how risky and inefficient the premises of a company entirely based upon this model. Speaking of risk...
2. Opendoor stock has been EXTREMELY volatile, and that is an understatement. After its IPO in the middle of the COVID pandemic, Opendoor saw their shares more than triple when the both the stock and housing markets were euphoric. However, after reaching its peak in early 2021, shares (first abruptly, then steadily) declined 98% until mid-June of this year. While the past month has sent this stock surging with newfound undue hysteria clouding the stock, shares declined MORE THAN 30% this afternoon between 2:48 PM Eastern Time up to the closing bell.
3. In less than 3 years, revenue has CRATERED by two-thirds, and it isn't poised to recover anytime soon. Q3 2022 earnings indicate that Opendoor's revenue was $16.5 billion a year, even while demand was starting to decrease in the US housing market. Fast forward to Q1 2025, Opendoor's revenue is $5.15 billion a year. Even the most optimistic outlooks indicate that Opendoor will close FY 2027 with $6.75 billion in revenue, a far cry from 2022 levels. But that's not the worst part, because...
4. Opendoor has **NEVER** been profitable, and it's not slated to become profitable over the next few years. Back to the earnings reports, Q3 of 2022 indicated that Opendoor lost about $1.15 billion a year and, while losses have narrowed to $368 million a year in Q1 of 2025, it's still not slated to be profitable by the end of FY 2027, with losses of about $264 million a year. This means that the company has had to burn through cash over the past few years, and it shows. Not only does Opendoor have negative free cash flow but, last but not least...
5. Opendoor has an almost 400% debt to equity ratio. As of Q1 of 2025, Opendoor's equity is $645 million, while its debt is $2.51 BILLION. The company is literally **drowning** in debt, and it has no revenue sources to cover its costs as it continues to burn through cash with its quarterly losses.

In short, please don't listen to meme stock investors who are desperately trying to hype this stock to save whatever returns they have made so far and focus on better companies with solid fundamentals in high-growth industries.

investingforbeginners,debt snowball,Please critique- interested in what others may have noticed.,"I love the stock market. It’s the largest, most complex puzzle in the world. It’s a game that’s impossible to ‘beat’ completely, but gifted observers are still rewarded with a pure, measured amount: returns. Asset classes each have their own function and best-use case within the market, and you ‘win’ if you buy them before everyone else buys them. My favorite thing? It’s all probability. Nothing is certain, and nobody can pretend it is, like they can in the real world. The stock market is honestly random. 



My methodology at this impossible game is similar to that of a detective trying to solve a crime. If I’m presented with a fact, any fact, say, “The FED is lowering rates,” there are perhaps ten, twelve, or twenty, or a thousand explanations for why they might be doing such a thing. Maybe they think inflation has burned off and want to start a rally. Maybe they think a recession is about to start and want the fiat-pump-dump economy to have one last gasp. Maybe Jerome Powell misspoke at the meeting. 



You can’t possibly make a decision based on one event. But when you have another event, say, Costco cutting their prices 40%, and the price of eggs falling after an insane high, then the number of likely reasons for the first event has to line up with the reasons that caused the second event too, because the truth, though it will never really be attained, caused them both. Add a thousand events, a thousand individual circumstances, and a blurry picture emerges. As time passes, add other explanations fall away, and the blurry picture sharpens. 



I observe all the time. I cannot turn it off. If I walk past a pickup truck on the street, I’ll notice that it’s parked in front of a factory in New Hampshire. From that, I’ll think it’s likely that the wages are not high, probably less than 100k per year. Then I notice the pickup truck is a nice, new model, one that easily cost 100k, or 70k. From that, I’ll think that the person is likely in debt. Then I’ll walk past a billboard, and it advertises a credit union. I wonder to myself how many people actually know what a credit union is.



These individual facts don’t help much. Big determiners, like tariffs, rate cuts, and yield curve graphs narrow the odds much more considerably, and this is what will be focused on. 



Take the example of the eggs. The price of eggs skyrocketed to $9 because of bird flu. Then they fell, again, to $4. I assumed that they had solved the bird flu issue, but then happened to come across information that indicated the prices did not fall because of bird flu. They fell because consumers were no longer able to pay for them. That’s right- Americans ruled out eggs in the grocery cart because they cost $9. Combine that with a tidbit I picked up that said Costco was cutting its prices 40%, and that Walmart, which normally does very well during pricey times, had low customer volumes, as did the rest of the sector, during the holidays. If things are too expensive, then people go to Walmart to buy gifts. But this year, they didn’t. Retailers braced for christmas shopping, and no christmas shopping came. $9 eggs and Walmart gifts stacked on shelves. The price wasn’t just too high- it was broken. But I’m getting ahead of myself. 



To explain this fully, I need to start with the key breadcrumbs — beginning about a year ago. I rewatched *The Big Short*, and on a whim, decided to check the major banks’ exposure to credit card debt. Right away, I found something disturbing: banks are still dealing in tranched debt assets. But instead of mortgages, they're using credit cards. The same structure. Different packaging.

I tried digging deeper, even with access to a Bloomberg terminal, but hit a wall. The system locked me out unless I shelled out $50,000 and registered as a financial institution. So I pivoted. I focused on macro data instead, indirect indicators of just how rotten things already were.What I found wasn’t pretty.  Consumer debt is skyrocketing. Savings are zeroing out. It’s not just theoretical. Every day, I see signs of consumer capitulation. 

Thus was born my first thesis: there would be a crash. Not from mortgages this time, but from the general irresponsibility built on any kind of debt you can think of. I couldn’t pinpoint the maturations, so I gave it a rough window: ten years.

Another critical datapoint is the government’s $30 trillion debt. Though let’s be honest, we probably don’t even know the real number. That figure has been snowballing for decades, the result of a system addicted to borrowing. It’s the numeric form of screwing over the next guy in charge. It’s a game of hot potato, where each administration prays the music stops under someone else.

Last time the banks got fancy with credit, the government stepped in and restarted the system. Whether they’ll do it again is unclear. That depends on the madness of men. But one thing seems likely. The sheer size of the debt now makes it less likely they’ll print. In 2008, they had room. After COVID, they printed again. But near the ceiling? They might not be able to. More on that later. 

COVID was another major determiner. It was the perfect, sudden, hard acceleration of inflation  exactly what we didn’t need. It exposed the inflation that had been lurking on balance sheets since the 2008 money-printing spree. You can’t inject that much liquidity into a system and expect no consequences. You can dress it up with accounting tricks to make inflation look tame, but if the money supply grows faster than the economy, the inflation is just waiting. COVID sped up the timeline. It hit consumers hard and triggered another round of printing. That was the moment the long fuse got shorter. These three major determiners kept my crash forecast at a likely ten years or less. Until I had more information, I could not narrow it down further. 

A third factor is sky-high P/E ratios across the US stock market in growth stocks, coupled with a toxic business philosophy. The conventional wisdom is that in order to earn new investors, companies have to beat earnings and revenue every single year. They have risen to the challenge, but in the last few years, have been stretching and stretching to earn Wall Street’s favor, earning growth stocks a very high P/E ratio- and pushing an already struggling consumer harder every year. These so-called “growth” stocks have very far to fall- so far that Warren Buffet pulled into cash, and Michael Burry went to China. When Buffet pulled out of major indices, that was a very, very bad sign. The iconic value investor has stated, with this move, that no value is left to be found, and wordlessly pulled into cash. 



Then the new information came, and it sped up my timeline considerably: the yield curve re-inverted.

The yield curve, the spread between the 10-year and 2-year Treasury yields, has predicted every recession since World War II except for 1966. It has been deeply inverted since October 2022. This is now the longest yield curve inversion in history.

When the curve re-inverts, flipping from inverted back to normal, it is not a relief. It is an alarm. Historically, it signals that something very bad is about to happen. The curve re-inverted in July 2007, November 1989, and again in February 2025. Each time, a recession followed within a year, often sooner. This was the signal I had been waiting for. Now the rest of the picture had to line up. After the election of Donald Trump, assets and especially U.S. equities rallied. Then came the tariffs. First floated as a negotiation tool, then actually implemented. That tightened my timeline further. I expected markets to react badly at first, forget about it, and then crash once the tariffs showed up in earnings reports. That explains the bizarre sideways action we are seeing now. This is classic bad sentiment. Retail investors are backing off. Institutions are repositioning. We are not crashing yet. We are leaking. So where are the institutions and ultra-wealthy moving? Bitcoin. And yet, despite being the dream of every Bitcoin holder, it is moving sideways. Odd.

The institutions, including the US government, moving into bitcoin, now of all times, as all the traditional analysts throw up their hands, is very strange. This is because there are very few realities that could cause these two events- which are diametrically opposed. One explanation is the institutions are readying themselves for the largest rug-pull that the retailers have ever seen. Another explanation is that institutions know something we don’t, and are already getting one foot in the door before something, whatever it is, blows a major gasket, and the US either prints or fails to print. Central banks and countries are also madly buying gold, so much gold that it caused drama with the London exchange paper gold market. This vanished from the news fairly quickly- but I remembered it. 



I see many complaints about the cutting of essential government departments, foreign aid, and other things from the government. This is causing all hell to break loose, as the largest employer of the largest economy hemorrhages employees, who will soon have to draw their savings out of banks to pay rent and buy food. Those banks will have to decrease their position sizes, and the snowball will roll on. Jobs are one the most important indicators of crashes, and the job data is some of the least helpful, because it has long been badly measured. The unemployment rate has ceased to be a good measure of recession, but the US government firing workers at this rate will not be good for the consumer. 



Why would the government be firing and cutting this frantically? Either they are draconian and heartless, or they are draconian and heartless and panicked, because we actually couldn’t afford any of it to begin with. Either way, in about a year, I figured the firings would start forcing people to pull from their savings in the bank, which will force the banks to exit their positions and maybe start runs. When the employer of last resort starts laying off, the cycle is near death. 

	After I saw the yield reinversion and layoffs, I tightened my timeline to a year. Then came another major determiner- NVDA earnings. NVDA beat earnings, again, because it has solid fundamentals and is still firmly cemented as the AI profiteer. But it sold off anyway, just like many major earnings sold off in winter around the holiday absence of shopping. This was a major tell- if good news becomes bad, and bad news becomes bad, then I considered my timeline tightened again, to eight months, or seven. Then, tariff concerns hit hard, and I thought the crash was here. NVDA stumbles, and the rest of the herd falls. 

  
  


I was wrong- we have ground sideways for a month now, and that in and of itself is new information. It means that a mere crisis in confidence caused by tariffs is not enough to push the boulder, else we would have been crashing already now, and I wouldn’t need to write this thesis. After I braced, and the crash didn’t come, I realized that this was very similar to 2008, again. There was an odd grind sideways, where the S&P tries to reach higher highs, but fails, three times or so, followed by a period of sell-offs. The crash in 2008 wasn’t caused by these crises in confidence- or even by the credit bomb exploding with the collapse of Bear Stearns in March. It was caused by a sudden collapse in confidence in October. 



Why October?

Well. Who ever feels good in October?

Traders have long known October as the month when the market gets cold feet. It’s not just folklore — look it up. The biggest crashes cluster there. October 1929. October 1987. October 2008. Something always seems to break. At first glance, it seems arbitrary. But after reading *The Hour Between Dog and Wolf*, it didn’t feel arbitrary at all. That book makes the case that markets are ruled by biology as much as logic. Cortisol, adrenaline, testosterone — they shape risk appetite, mood, behavior. In spring and summer, testosterone tends to rise, along with market confidence. But by fall, those levels drop, and cortisol takes over. Fear has a season. Maybe October really is wired into the system. Still, timing a collapse is a fool’s game. It could be November. Could be December. But you couldn’t catch me dead in any assets during October 2025. 

	One piece of information I’m still waiting on is the rate cut expected this summer. Jerome Powell is getting pressure from all sides. Trump is hammering him to lower rates to make room for his vision of a new America. Investors are begging for cuts so they can keep funneling money into the stock market.

Powell, for his part, insists that the money printing in 2008 and during COVID means rates should stay high, maybe for a long time. But he knows he can’t follow through on that without triggering a crash. Raising rates now would be an admission that the data has been lying, that inflation never really left, and that the entire market is overleveraged. If he goes that route, investors will sell. Fast.

So for now, Powell holds steady. He keeps rates unchanged and pretends everything is fine, that Americans not buying eggs is somehow normal. But he can’t stall forever. Once the tariff noise fades, markets will look for the next excuse to climb, the next catalyst for another euphoric leg up. And Powell will give it to them.

He’ll concede with a small rate cut this summer, just enough to buy a little more time, calm the noise, and try not to blow up the whole machine.

I’ll be taking that rate cut, whenever it comes, as a klaxon alarm. It will be the final chance to sell into strength, because most investors will see it as the start of a new Trump rally. But I won’t. I’ll see it for what it is: Powell playing the only card he has left.

Behind the scenes, institutions will be exiting through their dark pools like never before. Quietly, efficiently, ahead of the crowd.

Rate cuts after a yield curve inversion aren’t the green light everyone thinks they are. They don’t signal recovery. They signal desperation, a last-ditch effort to pull up a plane that’s already nosediving.

As of this writing, my thesis and my portfolio are positioned for a period of sideways movement in the short term. I plan to exit all U.S. equities during the spring or summer rally, likely around the time of the rate cut. After that, I expect continued chop through the summer, followed by another bull trap in early fall. It may be weaker than the last. Then comes the crash. October is the most likely window, but it could stretch into November or December. It probably won’t wait much longer.

In the near term, the only clear winner is gold. Bitcoin, tech stocks, U.S. equities, and foreign markets will all struggle. Spring will bring a strong buy-the-dip rally. Prices will rise, possibly near or above previous highs. But that surge will not hold. It will be the second-to-last move before reality sets in. This also gives time for the Bitcoin cycle to play out, and then finish…right around October. 

As summer drags on and the rally fails to break new ground, fear will return. We will see a quiet, indecisive market. It will feel like the summer before 2008. No momentum. No conviction. Just drift.

If a rate cut comes during this period, it might trigger one more upward move. Otherwise, markets will hang in suspension, waiting.

And in autumn, the illusion will break. Investors will realize the last push is over. The exit rush begins. Markets will sell off sharply in a full-blown flight to cash.

After the crash, new winners will emerge. The recovery will be sharp and fast, a true V-shape, as inflation comes roaring back. It never really left after COVID. We just buried it under credit cards and corporate balance sheets.

Everyone who fled to cash will suddenly realize the problem. Prices are soaring, and their money is shrinking. They’ll rush back into assets, desperate not to get left behind. If the U.S. prints, inflation will spike, and commodities will take off. If they don’t print, and instead begin the long, painful recovery we’ve delayed since leaving the gold standard, trust in the dollar will collapse — and commodities will still take off.

Gold will rise. Bitcoin, by then decoupled from the S&P, will soar. Both will leave traditional assets behind. U.S. equities and foreign markets might recover, or they might not. It will all depend on how shaken the world is after the crash.

This market has been downright bizarre. Unexplainable. Most people gave up trying to make sense of it long before I did — and I don’t blame them. It’s the most complex game on the planet, and there are machines far better at it than any of us. But what I don’t see are people updating their models to account for what doesn’t make sense. I see them rejecting it, dismissing it, pretending the confusion itself isn’t worth addressing.

It reminds me of the Bitcoin critics. They say it has no value. That’s true — in the way all currencies are true. It has the value we assign to it. And that value is about to explode. Because Bitcoin, for all the attempts to label it as a risk-on asset, as a meme, is a meme with no connection to the U.S. economy. It is tethered only to code.

The usual criticisms — energy use, fraud, transaction speed — once valid, are about to look like minor inconveniences. Bitcoin was created as a response to 2008. And this is starting to look like the version of 2008 we can’t print our way out of.

Yes, the U.S. dollar is still strong. It’s backed by the largest economy in the world, an economy that’s insulated and backed by a serious military. But that economy is now led by a government centralizing control and bracing for something ugly. I’m not sure yet if they are like Tsar Nicholas II, and have no clue what’s coming, or have inside information. That will be clear if we start to see our first trillionaires. 

The US economy has been strong, the pump so long, fueled off the fumes of 2008 and COVID, that nobody can conceptualize that you might prefer an asset not connected to the US, even as the US begins its downturn into insanity. The world’s reserve currency has been running the world’s fiat game for a long, long time.  

Note- bad times, not end times. The US is still the state best positioned in the globe, with deep resources, ports, and military immunity. The dollar is by no means dead- it will need rehabilitation, and it should not be surprising that other currencies will take up the mantle. US equities will do well, after either a lost decade or more steady growth, though I believe a lost decade to be more likely. 



Traditional analysts aren’t just conflicting in their explanations- they’re confused. They’re trying to solve for stability, using past performance, in a system that is inherently unstable. This is why they will miss the mark, just like they did in 2008. They have good logic, and rotten premises. They’re debating interior design, but the house is on fire. 



	Why? Why did it end this way? 



	People don’t like reading the fine print.

investingforbeginners,student loan help,Where do I even begin?,"Hi Reddit,

My situation seems different than most. I am currently 21M, just graduated from a competitive uni. I have my own LLC to work at a company as a contractor. I was previously making around $100k, but I expect to make around $200k a year going full-time. I have a couple thousand in student loans at various interest rates through federal loans and a private loan I plan on paying off ASAP due to high interest rate, have a car payment at 1% interest (\~$600/month), and I am paying off a mortgage (around $2.5k/month). What do I even do to start? I feel like I've read through hundreds of posts about how to begin but I've never seen any situation close to mine :/

Here's what I have been thinking:

1. I should most definitely pay off student loans, maybe not the low interest federal loans as aggressively?
2. Save up emergency fund money in a HYSA? I currently have AMEX at 3.6%
3. Here's where I am lost... I had a few friends tell me I could open a 401k at my own company and contribute to investing that way, but I'm not sure how that works exactly. If anyone has any experience, I would love to hear it.
4. Roth IRA?
5. Do I put more money into mortgage payments?
6. Personal investing? What do you even do after this point?

Any help would be much much much appreciated. I'd also love to hear if anyone has any recommendations for books or online resources for personal finance and investing.

investingforbeginners,student loan help,How do I retire my financially illiterate single father in the next decade? (26F) TYIA 🙏,"Hi everyone, thank you in advance and I’d be incredibly grateful for any advice. 

I love my dad so much and he would do anything to support me but I cannot convince him to start a retirement fund, he doesn’t have one because he works as a sole trader. He’s about 60 and the health issues are cropping up slowly but surely. He is reluctant to talk to me about his finances because of culture/pride/fathers believing they can figure everything out on their own, etc. But also he’s from a culture where “your children will look after you when you’re old”so I think he’s somewhat counting on me to figure that bit out. 

I’m currently coming out of uni finishing a Masters but already working part-time, and earning enough to be self-sufficient flat-sharing and putting a few hundred each month into ETFs. I have no student loans or other debt and I’m not in a hurry to get my own place or car or piano, (but happy to be convinced otherwise if this is a mistake). 

I am aware that my dad currently is living in a 1 bed apartment he has bought with inheritance and is currently paying the mortgage for. I have no idea how much this mortgage is, how much he has paid off already, nor how much he would get if he plans to sell it for his retirement fund, but as a guesstimate is currently worth about £600k (if this helps) and he’s lived there/paid off 6 years so far. He has no other major assets to my knowledge. 

What should I be doing or thinking of doing right now to be as prepared as possible? What kind of money burdens would I be expecting to be hit with? If he sells his property, would that be enough for him to retire comfortably? Is it simple as that? Does anyone who have retired their own parents have any advice?

investingforbeginners,ready to buy a house,Beginners payday challenge. How to invest for beginners.,"Here’s a short, beginner-friendly guide to investing in the S&P 500 as part of a ""payday challenge""—where you start investing small amounts from each paycheck. The S&P 500 is a stock market index tracking the 500 largest U.S. companies, making it a solid, diversified starting point for new investors.

Before you start, write down your monthly outgoings. Are you getting the best deals on your bills, could you get cheaper deals or cut some unwanted or unused bills out. 
Do you spend money on useless things, do you spend money on food out?. 

Build up an emergency cash saving pots. This should be 3-6 months of your monthly bills. 

Right, payday challenge.. pay your bills, pay yourself enjoy life. Treat investing like any other house hold bill. Netflix $17.99, cost of average uber eats order $34.. 

### Step 1: Understand the Basics
- **What is the S&P 500?** It’s a collection of the 500 biggest publicly traded companies in the U.S., like Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon. Investing in it means you’re betting on the overall growth of the U.S. economy.
- **Why it’s great for beginners:** It’s low-risk compared to picking individual stocks, historically averages about 7-10% annual returns (after inflation), and requires no stock-picking expertise.

### Step 2: Set a Payday Goal
- Decide how much you can invest each paycheck. Even $25-$50 is a start! The key is consistency—small amounts compound over time.
- Example: If you invest $50 per paycheck (biweekly), that’s $1,300 a year. With a 7% average return, it could grow to over $18,000 in 20 years.

### Step 3: Choose How to Invest
- **Option 1: Index Funds**  
  - Buy an S&P 500 index fund (e.g., Vanguard’s VFINX or VFIAX, Fidelity’s FXAIX). These funds mimic the S&P 500’s performance and have low fees (look for expense ratios under 0.1%).
  - Minimums: Some funds have no or low minimums ($1-$3,000), perfect for beginners.
- **Option 2: ETFs**  
  - Buy an S&P 500 ETF (e.g., SPY, IVV, VOO). ETFs trade like stocks, so you can start with just 1 share (VOO is ~$500 as of now, but fractional shares are an option on many platforms).
  - Great for smaller budgets—invest what you can each payday.

### Step 4: Open an Account
- Use a beginner-friendly brokerage like:
  - **Robinhood or invest engine, free trade, training 212:** No minimums, fractional shares available, fractional share allow you to buy part of a full share. 

### Step 5: Automate and Stick to It
- Set up automatic transfers from your paycheck to your brokerage. Many platforms let you schedule buys (e.g., $50 into VOO every two weeks).
- Don’t panic if the market dips—long-term investing smooths out the ups and downs.

### Tips for Success
- **Start small, stay consistent:** Even $10 per paycheck builds the habit.
- **Avoid timing the market:** Invest regularly, not just when it “feels right.”
- **Check fees:** Stick to low-cost options (under 0.1% expense ratio).
- **Be patient:** The S&P 500 grows over decades, not days.

You’re now ready for the payday challenge, don’t panic on RED DAYS, see these as bargain on sale days. It’s all about dollar cost averaging. This is for long term growth investing. Next payday, add a little into the S&P500. Who’s gonna join me in the payday challenge!?.

Investing in your 30s is a crucial step toward securing your financial future. Whether you're just starting or looking to refine your strategy, this guide will help you navigate the best investment opportunities for this pivotal decade. Your 30s are the perfect time to build a solid foundation for long-term wealth, and one of the most powerful tools at your disposal is compound interest. Understanding and harnessing this force can significantly boost your financial standing and help you prepare for primary life goals like homeownership, retirement, and family planning. 

In this article, we'll explore investment options, strategies, and tips tailored to your financial situation, ensuring you make informed decisions and set yourself up for success in the years ahead.

# Why Is Investing In Your 30s Important?

It is crucial that if you were not able to start investing at an earlier age than in your 30s, you start investing now. This is because by investing your 30s you would be open to investing for your retirement. It doesn’t matter if you have kids or not; you will have to [save for your retirement](https://www.pennycallingpenny.com/how-to-save-for-retirement/) nevertheless. And thus, crafting a plan for the same could begin in your 30s. You could start investing in tax-advantaged investment accounts like Roth [IRA](https://www.pennycallingpenny.com/what-is-an-ira-account/) or 401k. If you are a newbie, you could start with ETFs or index funds, which are easy to understand, have low risk and require minimal management. 

Further, if you wish to have children or wish to have them in the future, you should look out for investment options likewise. You should invest in some real estate or in assets that grow with time. Consider looking at long-term investment options. This will help you build your wealth so that you are able to secure your kids’ future. Hence, investing in your 30s is important so that you are able to meet these two very important financial goals.

# How To Start Investing In Your 30s?

It is important to understand how you should start investing, regardless of the kind of investment you wish to make. 

**1. Goals** 

The first step in investing is to understand the goals that you wish to achieve. Whether your financial goals are short-term or long-term will help you choose the kind of investment you wish to make. At this age, you are starting to invest. Usually, goals are long-term, like retirement or buying a house. Thus, long-term investments come into sight. 

**2. Strategy** 

After goals, you must decide on the strategy that you wish to adopt before you start investing. The strategy will make sure you are aware of the amount that will go into each asset so that you are able to keep track of the same. You can reach experts like Empower, who can help you and guide you through your investment and wealth management journey. 

**3. Account** 

You need to open an investment account. If your employer offers 401(k), you can open an account with the help of your HR in the office. Further, you can open an IRA and get options like accounts that mutual funds companies, banks or [life insurance companies](https://www.pennycallingpenny.com/best-life-insurance-companies/) sell. You can also buy bonds, stocks or mutual funds in a taxable account if you like.

# How To Invest In Your 30s?

The question consists of answers in four parts.

# A.   Why To Invest In Your 30s?

When you are starting to invest, you need to be aware of exactly why you should invest. Besides your financial goals, there are other reasons why making investments is a good option. 

●       **Tax**

When you invest, it assists you in getting tax benefits. And considering the tax rates going up with the inflation, investment is a good option. 

●       **Security**

If you have financial goals for retirement, you are on the right track, but if you are in doubt, you might want to invest for security. You can invest in real estate and thus make sure that you have a property that could be your living space in your old age. 

●       **Time**

In your 30s, you are more aware of finances than you were in your 20s, but you are still in time to invest. Thus making the 30s a perfect age to invest for long-term returns and watch your money grow more. 

●       **Goals**

And, of course, we talk about goals again. Investing is important so that you can have money to fulfill your financial or life goals, like retiring early or buying a house.

# B.   How Much To Invest In Your 30s?

The money that you wish to invest will obviously differ according to your income every month. But if you are going by the general approximation, then financial experts advise anywhere between 15% to 25% of your after-tax income. 

Now, much of the income that will actually go to your investments will be decided by the income, savings, and budget that you create for yourself. 

Further, if you are employing less of your income towards investment but are doing so for the long term, it can prove to be beneficial and profitable. Thus, you can compensate for the low amount of money in investment for a long-term investment.

# C.   How To Invest In Your 30s?

This might seem like an extension of the entire article, but it is not. Here, we discuss how to actually invest, aka investing styles. You either use these or use combinations of these to make a profit. 

●       **Quality Investing** 

This aims at purchasing stocks in a company that is beneficial or financially profitable. The companies have high earnings and a stable balance sheet. 

●       **Growth Investing**

This aims at purchasing stocks in a company that is on track for growth. The companies, when they reach success, would bring good returns and low dividend payouts for you as an investor. 

●       **Passive Investing**

This aims at purchasing stocks in a company and then not selling them instead holding them for a long time. It is like buying a stock and then forgetting about it. This is comparatively low-risk and more plausible when you are just starting. 

●       **Active Investing**

This aims at purchasing stocks in an undervalued company or undervalued stocks itself. This is the effort made to beat the market. You will be required to do research, time and skill to work this kind of investment out. This is comparatively high-risk and gives better returns than passive. 

●       **Value Investing**

This aims at purchasing stocks that are undervalued, which might grow to give value and hence provide profits when sold. You can get a high dividend yield if you are able to do it right. 

# D.   Where To Invest In Your 30s?

This is the part in which we discuss the investment options that are best when investing in your 30s. 

●       **Stocks**

It is a known fact that the stock market comes with its risks, but it also offers rewards that can sometimes outweigh the risks. But this is in the condition when you are able to take the risk and invest in the right kind of stocks. 

Direct equity investments are a good option if you are looking for long-term investments. In order to manage the risk that comes with these, you could diversify your portfolio by investing in different sectors and time frames. 

●       **ETFs**

Exchange-traded funds are stocks that are purchased at a lower cost. This is beneficial if you do not have a lot of money to invest in. You can similarly trade these as stocks. Here, you also have the option of diversifying your portfolio or investing in companies that are of the narrow sector. 

●       **Mutual Funds**

You can own a group of securities like bonds or stocks. In mutual funds you let the professional fund managers decide where they put your money in for investment. These funds bring in high returns and sometimes charge high fees as well. 

●       **Real Estate**

It is considered one of the most important investments that anyone who is now aware of their life goals and has a stable source of income should consider. You must invest in real estate. This is because it comes with good returns and is a security for your future as well. You would want at least one property in your name when you are in your 30s. 

●       **401(k)**

This is the investment kind for retirement. Your 30s is the best time to prepare and plan for your retirement. This is an employer-plus-employee retirement investment. The contributions will be paid together and in equal amounts. So, never not invest in it. This will help you to take advantage of free money from your employer. 

●       **IRA**

The kind of employment you are in, the employer doesn't provide for 401(k) plans. Thus you should then invest in individual retirement accounts. These accounts assist you in investing in ETFs, Mutual Funds, stocks and bonds. You can make an investment of around $6000 every year, which could give you a huge amount when you retire. The money would grow for a long time. You can automate your payments so that you stay committed. 

●       **Life Insurance**

Life insurance is the best investment. You could protect the wealth that you have been working so hard to earn even after you pass away. There are three types of life insurance: whole, guaranteed and universal, which are permanent life insurance. These life insurance help in taking care of your cash similar to a [savings account](https://www.pennycallingpenny.com/high-interest-savings-account-rates/). You would be investing while making sure that your family has financial security after you die.

# Conclusion

The 30s is the time in your life when you should have already fixed your finances. Know where investments make the most sense. But the truth is personal finance is tricky for some. And it is not until the late 20s that people start earning enough and are free from debt. You could only think about investing when you have extra money or enough money to pay off your bills before investing. Thus, [how to invest](https://www.pennycallingpenny.com/how-to-invest-during-inflation/) in your 30s doesn't have to be a question that is difficult to answer when you read an article as descriptive as ours.

investingforbeginners,buy vs rent,The Final Decision (Real Estate Investing VS. Stocks & Other),"Hey everyone,

So I’ve been really wrestling with the direction my life is taking right now, and honestly, I’m feeling kind of stuck. I’ve been putting in a ton of work to get where I am, and I’m terrified of letting it all slip through my fingers. You guys have been an absolute game-changer for me, and I’d love your final thoughts on a big decision I’m facing. I’ve been thinking about this for so long, and it feels like a make-or-break moment.

A while back, I posted on here asking about something pretty basic: Stocks vs. Real Estate? Which one would help me get closer to my financial goals faster? Which one could potentially set me up for the future I’ve been dreaming of, where I can retire my last parent early and ensure they never have to work to the bone again? And with $13K to work with, what would be the smartest move?

I got a bunch of feedback, and after thinking it all over, I just wanted to throw out the pros and cons I’ve heard, plus hear if your opinions still stand, or if anyone has any new insights. I trust your opinions, and your input has already made such a huge difference in helping me look at things from new angles.

Alright, let’s get into it:

1. Invest in both (Stocks & Real Estate):
I had a few people suggest I try a little of both, splitting my investments between real estate and stocks. The idea here is that it gives me some diversity, but honestly, I’m worried I might end up with mediocre or even poor results in both areas. And then there's the capital issue with real estate. I fear I might be setting myself up to run into financial trouble down the road if I start spreading myself too thin.

2. Stocks – The Big Gamble:
So, the stock market has been pretty polarizing. A lot of the people in the investment world swear by it, but most of the folks I’ve talked to have made very little profit. I’ve heard stories where people have barely earned $500 for every $1,000 invested over the last two years—nowhere near the returns I’m hoping for. I’m really trying to wrap my head around the idea that you can get rich through stocks, but there’s a lot of uncertainty. The market’s unpredictable. It almost feels like people are just throwing money into the wind, hoping for a return. Real estate might be a gamble too, but it feels like there's more control there.

3. Dividend Stocks – Is this the sweet spot?
Some people have recommended dividend stocks. These pay you a set amount on a regular basis, and they sound better than regular stocks because there’s some predictability. But even with dividends, you’re still looking at relatively small returns—like $500 every two years. And of course, the taxes on that income are crazy. You risk losing everything overnight, and that scares me. The question is, do I want to chase these small gains, or go for something with more potential?

4. Real Estate – The Flip Side:
I keep coming back to real estate. It’s not a walk in the park, I know that. There are always going to be issues with properties—unexpected repairs, vacancies, and dealing with tenants. But even with all that, it feels like there's something real there. I’d still be getting monthly payments and working towards building equity. It’s more predictable than stocks, and that sense of control is appealing. Sure, you can lose, but it’s not the same gamble as with stocks, where you're blindly hoping for a payout.

5. Wholesaling – The Hype vs. Reality:
Wholesaling looks attractive on paper: you get under contract, find investors, and make a quick profit. But the reality is, it takes a lot of legwork and trust-building. I’m especially concerned about dealing with shady people in my area. There are a lot of scams out there, and I wonder if it’s really worth the hustle. If it’s such a great opportunity, why don’t more people stick with wholesaling? What’s the catch?

6. Flipping Houses – Dangerous or Profitable?
Flipping houses is another route I’ve thought about, but from what I hear, it’s a high-risk game. It sounds like it can bankrupt people, and there are so many factors to consider, like market trends, materials, and the home itself. People are getting smarter about buying flipped houses, and I’m worried I could get caught in a bad deal, especially if the market shifts unexpectedly.

7. Paid Mentorship – Worth the Investment?
Mentorship could really speed up my learning curve, but I’m also a bit wary. I’ve seen stories where mentors take advantage of people, leaving them worse off than when they started. On one hand, I could get insider knowledge and avoid costly mistakes, but on the other hand, I’ve seen firsthand how a scam could destroy everything. I need to know: is mentorship worth it, or should I steer clear?

8. Airbnb – The Potential Pitfall?
Airbnb is definitely an interesting option. I could rent out rooms or entire properties, but there are some serious risks here too. People could damage the property, bring pests, or worse. And while it sounds great to have someone else pay your mortgage, I’m not sure I want to deal with the potential headaches. Plus, it’s a bit of a seasonal gamble. What do you think—is Airbnb just another risky way to make a buck, or does it have real potential?

9. Personal Loans – Risk or Reward?
Lending money to friends or others can feel good at first, but we all know it can turn sour quickly. What happens if they stop paying back, or worse, never pay you back at all? I’ve seen both sides of this. On the one hand, I’ve made a little extra cash. On the other, there’s a lot of risk. I’m just trying to figure out if it’s worth the gamble.

10. Spending Nothing and Investing in Multiple Things:
Right now, I don’t really spend much on myself, other than for my safety and to help my dad out. I haven’t invested in anything besides personal loans, but I’m seeing some returns—$100/month for the next few years, with a $1.5K total return on top. But is it worth it in the long run? It doesn’t seem like a huge win, and the ROI isn’t mind-blowing. Would investing in something like VOO be a better move?


So, there you have it. I’m at a crossroads, and I want to make sure I’m making the right move. Your advice has been invaluable already, but I’d love to hear what you think now that I’ve laid out everything. Have you tried any of these options? What did you learn from them? I really appreciate your input, and I’m so grateful for everything you’ve shared so far. Thank you!

investingforbeginners,buy vs rent,Alternative DCA strategy: scaling monthly buys based on % from ATH (tested vs standard DCA),"Hey everyone! I’ve been experimenting with different crypto accumulation strategies (mainly BTC, but applies to ETH too), and I’d love your input on one I’ve been testing.

Instead of regular DCA (e.g. 100€/month), I adjust the monthly investment based on how far the current price is from the all-time high (ATH).
The further below ATH we are, the more I invest — the closer we get (or go above), the less I invest.

Base DCA: 100€ per month

Adjustment rule:
For every 1% below ATH, increase PAC by 1€
For every 1% above ATH, decrease PAC by 1€

Limits: min 50€, max 150€

Example:
If BTC is –20% below ATH → I invest 120€
If BTC is +10% above ATH → I invest 90€

I ran a quick comparison (Jan–July 2025):

Strategy	BTC Accumulated	Final Value (€)

Flat DCA (100€)	0.00616 BTC	 672€
% Month-to-Month	0.00619 BTC	 678€
ATH-Based DCA	0.00700 BTC 	763€


All used the same budget (~700€)

Thoughts?

Has anyone here tested something similar?

Any better ideas for parameterizing buys?

investingforbeginners,buy vs rent,Can someone explain breakout vs bottom buys during the dip?,"I heard the term ""catching a falling knife"" and how you can never know where the bottom will hit. Should you wait for the breakout or trendline reversal before buying? Is this true? 

For example, if you buy a $90 stock that eventually bottoms out at $80 and then breaks out with the reverse trendline at $100, wouldn't it make sense to buy it at $90 instead of $100? The stock could even go lower and bottom out at $70 or $60, but if you are confident it will go back up, doesn't it make sense to buy it at lower prices?

I understand the difference between the two but what bothers me is the lack of any sort of way of understanding the added value of the reinvested dividends from acc etfs. Everyone seems quite happy with this invisible re-investment that just dissappears but contributes to the growth of the etf. 

  
What would be the difference, if you choose a Dist ETF, but commit to re-investing everything received into buying more shares of that ETF.

Is buying more shares of the ETF more valuable than the Acc equivalent that doesn't give shares but ""increases the value of the fund"" ?

investingforbeginners,afford a house,I made a detailed analysis of an odd pharmaceutical company that's now pivoting to AI.,"In the first half of 2025, an otherwise unremarkable former pharmaceutical enterprise, BGM Group, suddenly emerged as a “dark horse” in the capital market: Its market value soared from less than $100 million to more than $3 billion in just a few months, with an increase of nearly 30 times. Even after a correction, as of July 2025, its market value still remained at a high level of approximately $2 billion. But then questions arise: What has driven this market value miracle? Is it a pure market hype, or is there indeed a structural transformation behind it that is sufficient to revalue the valuation system? As a regional pharmaceutical company that once mainly focused on licorice preparations and crude heparin sodium, what did BGM do right to jump from being a “marginal player in traditional manufacturing” to a “star stock of the AI platform”?

 

When it comes to BGM's transformation, we must mention Chen Xin, BGM's new chairman. As a tech talent with a background in machine learning from the National University of Singapore and a former algorithm engineer at DJI and Geely, Chen Xin, leveraging his profound accumulation in autonomous driving algorithms and AI technology, has led the company's strategic transformation from traditional pharmaceuticals to AI-driven since taking office as CEO of BGM Group in 2024. He successfully guided BGM Group to rapidly achieve a leapfrog transformation from traditional pharmaceuticals to a diversified AI ecosystem. He not only promoted the integration of insurance AI with pharmaceutical business but also built an AI matrix covering fields such as intelligent travel (YX Management), service robots (Xingdao Intelligence), and software development (Shuda) through a series of strategic acquisitions, creating an innovative ecosystem of ""AI Agent + industry solutions"". This article will focus on the following core issues around the three stages of BGM's ""transformation - verification - prospect"": Why did BGM choose to shift to AI? Is its transformation feasible? Can investors truly profit from this transformation?

 

Transformation: Building an AI Matrix, the Logic Behind BGM's Cross-Domain Acquisitions

 

Why Shift to AI? — Three Core Opportunities

 

Decline in Main Business Profits

 

BGM's shift to AI was not abrupt; it was a strategic move to seek new breakthroughs amid limited growth in traditional businesses. The company long focused on bio-extraction products such as oxytetracycline API, licorice preparations, and crude heparin sodium, forming an integrated operation model of collection, processing, and export based on production facilities in Gansu and a factory in Chengdu. Despite reaching a revenue peak of $65 million in 2022, BGM's profitability gradually came under pressure due to intensified industry competition, fluctuating raw material prices, and changing policy environments. By the 2024 fiscal year, its revenue dropped to $25 million, with the main production line in Chengdu temporarily shut down, leaving the traditional model facing challenges of marginal slowdown and insufficient risk resistance.

 

Board Reshuffle: New Chairman Chen Xin Takes on the Mission of Enterprise Digitalization in the AI Era

 

Former Chairman Xin Zhanchang voluntarily stepped aside, stating that ""younger teams are better suited to the strategic rhythm of the AI era."" New Chairman Chen Xin, a former AI algorithm engineer with experience at DJI and Geely, specializes in algorithm model deployment and cross-domain integration.

 

The ""Dual Gap"" Opportunity Between Traditional Enterprises and AI Companies

 

BGM's AI transformation was not a blind chase of the current ""AI boom"" but a response to two pain points: small and medium-sized traditional enterprises struggling with digital transformation (""dare not use, do not know how to use, cannot afford to use"" AI), and AI companies lacking real-world application scenarios to implement mature AI tools. BGM's AI transformation strategy, through the model of ""technology popularization + business scenario integration,"" aligns closely with the policy advocacy of ""cloud adoption, data utilization, and intelligence empowerment."" Currently, small and medium-sized enterprises face survival difficulties, including high costs, difficulty in acquiring customers, and weak digital capabilities. According to data from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, over 60% of small and medium-sized enterprises have structural weaknesses in ""not knowing how to use or afford digital technologies."" Meanwhile, AI companies need real application scenarios—AI without scenarios is like ""an arrow without a target."" For example, while GPT-4 is technologically powerful, it relies on ChatGPT's chat scenarios to drive user growth and subscription payments; moreover, AI model iteration requires continuous data feeding, and data can only come from real scenarios. This creates a ""new middle ground"" between AI demand and supply. BGM, understanding the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises and gradually gaining AI tool development capabilities through a series of AI company acquisitions, has become a ""bridge enterprise"" in this structural shift.

 

 

The Underlying Logic of Frenzied Acquisitions

 

Independent R&D of AI would mean long cycles, high capital input, and shortages of technology, data, and users – a cost too high for BGM in its transitional phase. Thus, BGM quickly entered new tracks through share-swap mergers and acquisitions, ""purchasing"" mature scenarios (insurance, travel, health tea, etc.), existing users, and real data streams in one go. It retained the original operational teams and brands, achieving ""scenarios as deployment, data as training,"" and rapidly locked in and expanded high-value application landing areas.

 

Decoding BGM's Acquisition Directions

 

AI Technology Foundation

 

For BGM, the AI technology foundation is not a showy ""black technology"" but a converter that transforms technology into commercial value. It allows AI capabilities acquired through each acquisition to be flexibly combined like Lego blocks – this is the key to its successful transformation. By integrating industry transaction systems (business data), building private knowledge bases (knowledge graphs and rule bases), and configuring elastic computing power (hybrid cloud architecture), BGM has finally formed an enterprise-exclusive intelligent decision-making hub.

 

AI Application Tools

 

BGM's acquisition of these AI tool companies is not just to add more product functions, but to build a closed-loop AI platform with implementation capabilities. By integrating different tools, it enables traditional enterprises to solve practical problems with AI in one stop, achieving cost reduction and efficiency improvement. For example, New Media Star provides advanced AI intelligent marketing tools to enhance enterprise marketing efficiency and effectiveness; Shuda Technology's low-code development platform helps traditional SMEs achieve digital transformation.BGM has never aimed to build a simple ""toolbox"" but an ""intelligent operating system"" – whoever controls the daily work entry point of enterprises will control the future intelligent ecosystem.

 

AI Application Scenarios

 

Why does BGM acquire traditional enterprises in vertical industries? The essence of this question is: Why does BGM not just make ""tools"" but buy ""traditional industries"" for AI implementation? BGM's acquisitions of insurance companies, travel platforms, and robotics firms seem to span a wide range and have no connection. However, from the perspective of ""how AI is implemented,"" one can see its ingenuity: these seemingly traditional industries are actually the real scenarios where AI can best play its role. For instance, insurance business processes are standardized with clear data structures, making them naturally suitable for AI applications in pricing, claims settlement, and customer service; the travel industry has massive real-time data, making it ideal for AI-driven scheduling and risk control.What BGM aims to do is not a general AI toolbox, but to get directly involved, embed AI into real businesses one by one, continuously obtain data from scenarios, refine models, and optimize products. This approach of ""buying scenarios and implementing AI"" allows it to go deeper and faster than platforms that only sell tools, and truly enables it to build an AI business ecosystem.

 

A Combinable, Implementable, and Sustainable Ecological Closed Loop

 

BGM's AI ecosystem is not simply a collection of acquired technology companies and scenario-based enterprises. Instead, through a three-layer layout of ""technology foundation + tool products + vertical scenarios,"" it has built an interconnected and closed-loop intelligent system. The technology foundation (e.g., RONS Technology) provides computing power, algorithms, and data governance capabilities for the platform, enabling flexible combination and efficient operation of various tools; AI tools (e.g., Shuda, New Media Star, Yunding) are visible and usable functional modules for enterprises, solving daily problems such as marketing, customer service, and data analysis; vertical industry scenarios are real data sources and test sites, verifying tool effectiveness while feeding back to algorithm optimization. For example, in the operation of Rongshu Insurance, customer data realizes risk identification and recommendation logic configuration through Shuda's visualization platform, and such data is then used for model training by Rongshu Intelligence, continuously improving the intelligence level of the entire platform. These three components are interlinked, endowing BGM with the ability to ""develop tools, implement scenarios, and nurture models,"" forming a truly operational AI business ecosystem.

 

Verification: Financial Evidence of BGM's AI Transformation

 

Cost Reduction and Efficiency Improvement of Acquired Enterprises

 

For start-ups, management and sales expenses often constitute a major part of main business costs, which often leads to losses in the early stages. As a result, BGM was in a state of loss in 2024, with revenue from its AI solutions and insurance business at -$0.68 million. However, by introducing automated technologies, BGM successfully reduced its reliance on manual labor, achieved significant cost reduction and efficiency improvement, and finally turned losses into profits in the latest financial report. In its latest financial report, BGM demonstrated its outstanding ability to achieve cost-effectiveness and efficiency improvement through strategic acquisitions. Notably, the company's AI solutions and insurance business segments achieved a remarkable performance leap, with revenue surging to $4.68 million. This astonishing growth of 788.24% not only proves the success of strategic acquisitions but also highlights BGM's strong potential and market competitiveness in the AI and insurance fields. This significant financial improvement will undoubtedly boost market confidence in BGM's future development.

 

2.  Supporting Financial Performance DataBGM's financial figures fully confirm the success of its strategic transformation. Over the past year alone, the company has achieved a qualitative leap in overall performance. In terms of operating income, the company currently consolidates its original pharmaceutical business, AI solutions, and insurance business in its financial statements, while other newly acquired businesses this year have not yet been consolidated. The insurance and AI solutions businesses contributed $4.68 million, driving an overall year-on-year revenue growth of 32.7%. More notably, profitability has improved significantly, with gross profit surging by 78%—from $1.41 million in the first half of 2024 (1H24) to $2.51 million in the first half of 2025 (1H25). Shareholders' equity also jumped from $44.09 million to $183 million, representing a 316% increase. These figures clearly demonstrate the driving effect of AI-related businesses on the company's overall performance.

 

Why is BGM's Revenue Growth Highly Certain?

 

The high certainty of BGM's revenue growth essentially stems from its position at a structural nexus of ""strong demand + closed-loop supply""—on one side, the urgent need for transformation among traditional enterprises; on the other, its complete, deliverable ecosystem of AI tools. On the demand side, traditional enterprises are facing unprecedented pressure: nearly 60 million small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are struggling to navigate the tide of digital transformation. For one, the accelerating AI era has intensified ""involution""—industry cycles are compressing, product lifecycles are shortening, and competition is accelerating. For another, China's corporate financing environment has cooled sharply, with corporate fundamentals deteriorating significantly. Since 2021, refinancing activities have plummeted for both Chinese concept stocks and Hong Kong-listed stocks, and fundraising by startups has dropped over 80% from peak levels. Meanwhile, ""high-margin industries"" are fading rapidly, with ROE levels in traditional sectors like pharmaceuticals, real estate, and finance in steady decline, and the proportion of loss-making enterprises rising. Against this backdrop, enterprises' need to ""improve efficiency and reduce costs"" has become unprecedentedly strong, and their focus on AI has shifted from experimentation to a rigid necessity. At the same time, AI enterprises themselves face severe challenges. Despite continuous breakthroughs in AI technology and soaring capital market enthusiasm for the AI track, many AI companies struggle to find clear, effective application scenarios, leading to profitability difficulties and stunted growth. A large amount of AI technology remains in the laboratory or conceptual stage, lacking solutions that can truly be applied to traditional enterprises' operations at scale. AI enterprises urgently need to align with the actual needs of traditional enterprises, transforming technological achievements into deliverable products and services to achieve commercialization. On the supply side, BGM, relying on its comprehensive AI tool ecosystem, has built a complete technical response. Through acquisitions of targets such as Shutai Technology, Rongshu, and New Media Star, the company has developed an AI capability matrix integrating software and hardware, ranging from no-code automation and insurance actuarial modeling to humanoid robots. Unlike single-function AI outputs, BGM offers a multi-layered, multi-scenario combinable ""AI toolkit"" covering core operational links for SMEs, including marketing, customer service, processes, analysis, and hardware execution. SMEs need no in-house technical teams or large budgets—by simply accessing the BGM platform, they can obtain ""usable, user-friendly, and sustainable"" AI capabilities. Additionally, as a U.S.-listed company, BGM's strong financing capacity provides sufficient capital, enabling it to steadily deploy AI technologies, rapidly integrate innovative resources, and build a complete, efficient AI technology closed loop. It is within this matching of ""strong demand and comprehensive supply"" that BGM has become a key bridge connecting technology and the market. Its growth is not only explosive but also long-term and sustainable.

 

Short-Term Integration Pressures

 

Despite the rapid growth of its AI segment, BGM still faces challenges such as integration difficulties, profit realization, and regulatory uncertainties. New businesses like Xingdao Intelligence remain in the investment phase, with short-term loss pressures persisting. Technical architectures and team cultures across multiple business lines vary significantly, and the release of synergies will take time. Breakthroughs in organizational integration, product implementation, and data closed-loop systems will determine the depth and sustainability of its transformation.

 

Conclusion: AI Empowerment Usheres in a New Era of BGM's Growth

 

This is a transformation. In just one year, BGM has evolved from an ordinary pharmaceutical company into an AI-driven technology platform, delivering stunning results: its market value has soared from $40 million to $2 billion. Behind these figures lies a compelling story of how a traditional enterprise has rejuvenated itself through AI. BGM's wisdom lies in not abandoning its roots but equipping traditional businesses with an AI engine. After adopting intelligent algorithms, its insurance business saw processing efficiency increase 56-fold; adding insurance and AI segments to its pharmaceutical base boosted net profit margin by 520.6%. More impressively, these changes are not fleeting—the continued surge in its robotics business and strong growth in AI solutions suggest brighter days ahead. Today's BGM is thoroughly transformed. It retains the stability of the pharmaceutical industry while embracing the vitality of a tech company. This ""two-legged"" approach allows investors to ""share in the gains."" Looking ahead, as its AI business matures, the company's market value moving toward $10 billion will be a natural progression. This is not just BGM's transformation story but a roadmap for all traditional enterprises seeking upgrading and transformation.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/investingforbeginners/comments/1m85a6c/i_made_a_detailed_analysis_of_an_odd/,1753365818.0,Green-Cupcake-724,1m85a6c,not_advice_seeking
investingforbeginners,afford a house,Savings vs investment ratio,"Hi! I am in my mid 30s and my bf and I have been trying to save aggressively for a down payment on a house. We live in a very HCOL area unfortunately (and don’t see that changing in the foreseeable future).

At this point I think we have enough in savings where our down payment fund is more than enough for the kind of house we’d be able to afford mortgage payments on (hoping for something in the $500k-$600k range but have enough in the down payment fund for a 20% down payment on an $800+k house). I also have $15k set aside as an emergency fund that doesn’t count towards the down payment calculations. If we could find a $500-$600k house (big IF) we should be ok for closing costs and funds for some emergency repairs that could come up. 

Now that I feel like we have the base of our down payment fund in a HYSA I’m trying to figure out what to do with my savings each month and am wanting to start investing. 

I max out my 401k now and then put about $1,200-2,000 per month into a HYSA (down payment fund) depending on what other expenses I have going on that month. Now that I want to start investing in basic EFTs like VOO and VTI in a brokerage account but I’m not sure how much of my savings should be invested each month vs how much should be squirreled away in the HYSA. 

Any advice on the right ratio of cash vs. investments given the context of our house savings goal? Thanks!!

investingforbeginners,afford a house,Roast my investment,"Hey everyone, been lurking for a while and learning a lot from you all. Like many of you, I am trying to build wealth with real estate, and I would like some feedback on an investment I just made.

A little about me - I work as a smokejumper through the summer months, and I have 6 month off in the winter to do as I please. When I was younger I would typically ski, travel and “fuck off” for that time period. After COVID, I started to feel the strain of inflation, and all of a sudden felt like I could not afford to live that way anymore. So I decided to do something about it. My primary goal was to own a home and generate passive income that would cover  my housing costs so that I didn’t need to stress about where I was going to live anymore.

Luckily I had bought an acre of land (for dirt cheap) back in 2013 near a ski hill. It has always been a goal of mine to build my own house. I sold that property post Covid for an insane gain (lucky me) and had 300k to invest. I then took 1 year off of smokejumping to build houses (just to learn). I then purchased a home near the smokejumper base that had a large backyard which backed up to an alley. I threw down a large down payment (150k), and secured a decent interest rate (4.25%) on a 3 bed 1 bath home in a very desirable location. This put my monthly payment at $1500/month including taxes and insurance.

I then spent the other 150K building a 600 square-foot garage with a 600 ft.² luxury apartment above it in the backyard, with the garage facing the alley. It is an ADU with a separate address, and separate utilities - essentially a completely separate residence. This took me two winters (my “off season” from smokejumping) of working around the clock, but I am finally finished. When I say I built it, I mean, I ACTUALLY built it. No contractors. I drew my own plans, with all structural details, no engineer. I poured the foundation, I framed it, plumbing, electrical, insulation, drywall, all the finish work. Everything. I’m incredibly proud of this accomplishment, and as difficult as it has been, it is so fulfilling.

Anyways, time for you guys to roast me… I now have tenants in my main house paying $2100/month. So I have accomplished my goal of having my basic housing costs covered and secure (I live in the new ADU). The extra $600/month of profit I just keep for maintenance, repairs, vacancy etc.

Sometimes I wonder if the smarter thing to do would have been to put that 300K in the stock market and have truly passive income from that. I don’t regret what I did, because it has been so fulfilling (although I am BURNT THE FUCK OUT at the moment haha) but I want to learn from this investment so that the next is even better.

The purchase price of the home was 430k, and I could now sell the whole property for 750-800k, so I did build a decent amount of equity.

This is also my first time posting on Reddit, so feel free to ask for clarification and other details. I am learning a lot.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investingforbeginners/comments/1lfftc7/roast_my_investment/,1750352086.0,Careless-Revenue4467,1lfftc7,advice_seeking
investingforbeginners,afford a house,"Life is finite. Risk aversion. (Once bitten, Twice shy.)","Some day I will die. I do not know when, but I know I will not live forever.

Every dollar I make in salary at my workplace represents a minute, hour, day, or some other unit of time I will NEVER get back. It represents time I'm not spending with family and time I'm not out enjoying myself.

Watching that money disappear is like shaving years off my life. Hell, I'd say burning it may even be more productive since some people at least get some form of enjoyment out of smoking cigarettes...

Now obviously, I need that money to afford food and whatnot, so I can't go quitting my job. But I do not spend frivolously on luxury goods.

--------------------

I was given a $3k High School graduation present. Opened an eTrade account and bought a bunch tech stocks (Microsoft, Dell, IBM, Cisco, Juniper, etc) in the late 90s. Made a couple thousand more in under a year. Figred I couldnt lose, as I had a background in tech. As an engineering student, I knew the industry.

By the early 2000s, my portfolio was worth three digits.

Before I pulled the plug and sold all my stocks, I was literally sitting on the computer the entirety of 2002, 2003, and 2004 hitting Refresh and watching my portfolio lose value.

I had some startup companies that were promising that ended up going under and their stock values ended up being ZERO.

I did not, and still to this day do not know where the money went. It just disappeared.

People tell me I sold in the dip when I should have bought more. I was in high school/college. I was working low end jobs and needed the money. I had no money to invest.

Few years later, I got grandmothers inheritance to the tune of $30k in 2005. Bought a house for cash in the boonies and put another $10k in my own savings into it (paint, carpet, trim work, etc.) Sold the house for $65k three months later.

Bought another house closer to where I wanted to live on an ARM in 2006 and was upside down, two years later... $240k mortgage at 5% going up to 7% in three years on a house that appraised for $125k.

BUT at least I had a roof over my head.

I buy houses that I can flip/rent. They're tangible and I can control what work goes into them. If I want to make a house increase in value, I can renovate it. And an house will NEVER be worth NOTHING. Even if it burns down, the vacant land will have value.

I am VERY risk adverse, having been bitten before.

I can not control the value of a stock. I have zero influence if a company will release a gadget that will catch on and be the next big thing or if it will flop.

I can't subtly count cards, so I don't set foot in casinos.

I'm of the mindset that to invest in stocks, you need to have money that you're not afraid of losing.

How can I get out of this mindset so that I can YOLO all my savings on whatever wallstreetbets is peddling? People make bank day trading. I want to know their secret.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/investingforbeginners/comments/1lbrwa0/life_is_finite_risk_aversion_once_bitten_twice_shy/,1749962290.0,pele4096,1lbrwa0,advice_seeking

Currently: between 295-300k currently, 6 positions. Approximately 3.5 straight years of gains, a lot less churning of positions and much more DCA with short term negative catalysts as long as the thesis doesn’t change.

Due diligence, and go for it. Avoid those panic highs/lows, get on first base! Take the 25% gain. Take the 50% gain. Secure the 100k, don’t chase the million.

After everything has been settled I have about $100k in a regular credit union savings account.  I also have about 100k in a 401k.  I owe about 125k on my home with an interest rate of 3.025%.
I have helped my son buy a house and an airplane (my Dad and family are pilots).

Also, I loaned a friend $125k to help him with a lower interest rate. He was paying 8.5% because of a divorce and I'm receiving 5% interest, I loaned this to him when rates were around 3.5-4%. We went through a title company and he pays me $817.00 per month and has never missed a payment. (His home is the collateral).

I know I should be investing the cash I have in my savings but am so worried about losing it I'm kinda frozen.  My husband is not a financial wiz and neither am I.
Honestly, I'm just looking for some direction. I have listened to podcasts and read some books but I only get more confused. ",15,https://www.reddit.com/r/investingforbeginners/comments/1focmig/if_you_had_75k_how_would_you_invest_it/,1727184870.0,MzMe1995,1focmig,advice_seeking

SavingMoney,small windfall,How I view finances vs how I see others view finances,"I've noticed for many years...I hope this might help others in their financial journey.

We all wish we woulda, coulda, shoulda bought the winning stock/bitcoin/lotto ticket, me included. I hear it from friends, family, co-workers. Relying on winning the lottery or some big windfall for retirement . Or worse yet, wishing they bought or held that meme coin that was pumped and dumped, ""knowing"" that they could have sold it at the right time to become a bajjilionare....Basically, If I bought xyz back then, I'd be rich now.

Not to say people don't get lucky and strike gold out there, but that's a small % of people who get in at the right time. For everyone else, by the time they find out, it's too late.

I made mistakes along the way, but I realized (early on, thank goodness) that (nearly) no one wins when they gamble. Whether the lottery, casino, day trading, timing the market, meme & alt coins, etc.. Or waiting, hoping, wishing that somehow you'll land in a pile of money.... 

I invested slowly, a bit each paycheck. Kept it simple, followed the market, like the SP500. It took time...years and years of time... And now because of that, I'm way..... way.... further ahead financially than many others around me. (Not everyone, but..)

I didn't hold my breath to win the lottery or land a windfall. I didn't try to ""get rich quick"". I took action, did something about it, being careful not to be in a rush, careful not to listen to all the noise...Just setting my finances on auto pilot... 

And now I am closing in on a 7 figure net worth.. Not super wealthy or anything, but hey, I'm just a normal person, working a normal job, making normal pay, living in a normal (HCOL) area. If I can do it......

SavingMoney,small windfall,How To Save $5000 In 100 Days Money Saving Challenge?,"Whether you’re barely making ends meet or earning in surplus, saving a portion of your income seems like a challenge. But do you desperately want to start saving? These 100 days money saving challenge may be the best way to make saving a part of your routine. 

Challenges make things fun and let you accomplish saving goals in real time. While the internet is flooded with hundreds of moneys saving challenges, the best is the one that fits your budget and yet lets you save a significant amount. 

These 100 days money saving challenge helps you to save $5000 by the end. However, if that seems to exceed your saving capacity, you can customize daily savings as per your finances and willingness.

# How To Save $5000 In 100 Days? 

Did the viral [100 envelope challenge](https://www.pennycallingpenny.com/100-envelope-challenge/) just cross your mind? Well, this challenge is a similar one but with a few interesting twists. 

We understand $5000 may be a too aggressive saving goal for many. But as said earlier, you can customize your overall and daily saving goals. If you’re beginning your savings journey, any suitable amount would be a milestone. 

There can be two ways to save during this challenge:-

# 1. Fixed Savings Approach 

If you are determined to meet a specific savings goal over a pre-decided duration, this approach would be a great choice. Divide your goal amount for example it’s $5000 for this challenge into equal portions for your daily or weekly savings. 

From day 1 to 100, put aside $50 each day without fail. Make sure to maintain a tracker to see how far you’ve come. These savings can be in the form of cash or an automated transaction into your [emergency fund](https://www.pennycallingpenny.com/emergency-fund/) savings account. Choose an amount that you can easily stick to for 100 days.

# 2. Variable Savings Approach 

If saving a fixed amount each day seems difficult, you can take up the variable approach. This one offers you flexibility with your daily or weekly savings. While you still need to put some money aside everyday for 100 days, you can decide a different amount when you want. 

**Want to make it more spontaneous and fun?** 

Fill a jar with chits that have random amounts from $25 - $100 (or more) on them (can be a different range based on your preference). Every day pull out a chit and set aside the amount mentioned on it. 

Well, your saving doesn’t have to be limited to the amount on these chits, you can always save a little more when you wish. You can also use a number generator to save time on creating chits. Although make sure you have a tracker to guide with your daily/weekly progress. 

Calculate your weekly savings to make sure you save enough to meet your total saving goal. Again, you can either keep your savings as cash or make a transfer to your savings account.

# Getting Started 

As crucial it is to save a portion of your income, it can often seem difficult. Now that you are taking a step towards improving your money saving habits, begin correctly.

# Where To Keep Your Savings? 

One of the major concerns is finding where to store your savings. While a piggy bank or a secret box is absolutely fine, making your savings easily accessible may tempt you into spending them the next time you get a chance. 

We suggest opening a special, [high-yielding savings account](https://www.pennycallingpenny.com/high-interest-savings-account-rates/) instead. You won’t have an excuse of having no cash in hand and your savings will be safe from impulse spending. 

If you intend on saving a fixed amount every day, make use of the automated savings feature. This way your money will automatically get added to your savings before you get a chance to spend it on something unnecessary.

# Customize The Challenge As Per Your Preferences 

Adjusting the saving challenge as per your preferences and needs increases the chances of you sticking to it till the end. Saving something is better than spending every penny in your wallet (or bank account). 

Moving ahead with the variable saving approach lets you choose a different saving amount each day or each week according to current or upcoming financial necessities. 

Suppose you start the 100 days money saving challenge somewhere near the holiday season. Flipping your savings may help you keep up with it till the end. In the earlier months, your savings can range between $50 - $100 every day. As holidays get closer, you can save $10 - $40 every day. 

In simple words, you can tweak and flip the savings amount from higher to lower or vice versa depending on your expenses. Remember the ultimate goal of this challenge is to save SOME amount of money.

# Let’s Make It Fun! 

We told you this money saving challenge comes with interesting twists. Daily and weekly challenges will help you pave the way through unhealthy spending habits and discover new ways to save extra dollars. Let’s hop right onto them!

# Daily Challenges 

Choose at least 2-3 from these every day. 

**1. No Spend Day:** Choose a few days in a week when you pick free activities and stuff over spending your dollars on something you can absolutely live without. 

**2. Meal Prep:** Prepare a meal plan and spend the day savoring home-cooked food so you don’t have to eat out. Pack your lunch for workdays and cook your own delicious dinner. This can be done on most days of the week. You can reward yourself on the weekend with a [budget-friendly meal](https://www.pennycallingpenny.com/cheap-summer-meals/) at your favorite place. 

**3. Make Your Own Coffee/Tea:** Instead of spending on coffee/tea at a cafe down the street, make one for yourself at home. There’s certainly no harm in making this a regular practice. 

**4. Pick Free Entertainment:** Look for free or low-cost entertainment around you - library events, free concerts, movie nights in local parks, etc instead of spending on subscriptions, expensive parties or movies. 

**5. Discount Hunt:** You cannot completely slash shopping off from your lifestyle. But when you have to shop, make sure you look for great discounts. Look for ways to get maximum discounts on groceries, clothes, and more. Plan your next shopping spree according to upcoming sales. 

**6. Unsubscribe:** When trying to [save money](https://www.pennycallingpenny.com/save-money-live-better/) you need to beware of several money parasites that are often missed out. Subscriptions are few of those. Get rid of unnecessary subscriptions to save a significant amount from your monthly income. Keep a check on auto-paid subscriptions to cut-off unnecessary expenses. 

**7. Declutter:** Perfect for cleaning up your surroundings and making money out of it. Reassess your belongings and sell the ones you no longer need. Transfer the money to your savings. Do this one in a while to boost your savings and declutter your space. 

**8. Walking/Cycling Day:** Ditch your vehicle on a few days to choose walking or cycling for shorter distances. You can also opt for cheaper public transport to [save money on gas](https://www.pennycallingpenny.com/how-to-save-money-on-gas/). This is yet another lifestyle change that can help you save significantly. 

**9. Carry Your Own Bottle:** Instead of spending on bottled water, start carrying your own reusable water bottle. Good to make it a habit!

# Weekly Challenges 

Choose 1 from these every week. 

**1. Pantry Picked:** This one’s a part of the daily meal prep challenge. Assess what’s already available in your pantry and plan the entire week’s meal with only those supplies. This helps save on groceries, ensuring no wastage of food. 

**2. No Impulse Buy:** Avoid any impulse purchases for an entire week. You can do this every week honestly. Whenever you’re tempted to buy something unnecessary, wait for at least 24 hours and understand if you really need that stuff or you can go on without it. Mostly the urge subsides. If it’s something important, you can look for cheaper alternatives later. 

**3. Double Down:** Got windfalls or raises? Count them as your savings. Or maybe you can double the amount of your daily or weekly savings to boost your overall progress. 

**4. Entertainment at Home:** Plan your entertainment at home for the week. Instead of going for drinks, clubbing, or movies, plan game nights, movie marathons, craft meet-ups at home with your beloved ones.

# Make It Till The End

Saving a few dollars everyday is definitely easier than showing up for workouts every morning. We want you to finish off this challenge with your desired savings. While you may be determined as well, here are a few tips to make sure you keep going. 

**(1) Know Your Goal:**  Having an end goal in mind before you start saving, helps you stick to the challenge till the end. Remember how as a child, our parents promised us rewards for excellent academic performances? The excitement for that one reward kept us motivated to achieve the best possible grades. Let your aspirations be your motivation this time as well. It can be a downpayment, [paying off debt](https://www.pennycallingpenny.com/paying-off-debts/), saving for a dream holiday, or preparing for your kids’ admission. 

**(2) Set Reminders:** Once you take up these 100 days money saving challenge, there should be no excuses. Setting reminders on your phone (daily or weekly) will ensure that your money saving goals always stay in the back of your mind. This makes meeting daily savings goals easier. 

**(3) Reward Yourself:**  While completing the saving challenge would be your ultimate reward, little appreciation for yourself along the way will keep you going. You can choose a few reasonable weekly or bi-weekly rewards for yourself (your favorite treats, hangout with friends, etc). 

**(4) Do It With A Friend:** Taking up this [money saving challenge](https://www.pennycallingpenny.com/52-week-money-challenge-5000/) with a friend or family member will keep your spirits high. Start together and track whether you’re both making enough progress on the saving journey. Share this challenge on your Pinterest board now!

# Go Easy On Yourself Yet Stay Focused 

If you keep waiting on the perfect time to start saving, it may probably never arrive. It’s better to start now with whatever income you have. Start small, but make sure to save at least something. 

For the ones who think they can build lump sum savings overnight - set realistic goals based on your income and expenses and follow a plan consistently. 

We hope these 100 days money saving challenge helps you meet your savings goals or at least start your savings journey. Stay motivated and focused to improve your financial well-being!

SavingMoney,what to do with extra money,Money I saved and made off of walking & receipts,"
I know this year I'm going to be looking for every way possible to get money back, make money, and save money. So I wanted to share all the apps and Cashback programs I went through from the beginning of last year til now. One or two I've only had for a short amount of time. I included my sign up date, a referral code for a sign up bonus, and the amount I have cashed out. 

I made one of these last year and have kept all the best and fastest ones that are little to no effort. Some are apps making money walking, Scanning Receipts, Cashback

To comply with reddit rules I left off all links. If you want the referral bonus$$ for the ones with links, please feel free to DM me.

Also I added and tried a bunch of people suggested So if you have any please let me know. (Thank you 😊 ) I'll go from the The highest amount to lowest, some vary depending when I started so yah. Here we go

1/12/24 MSR- ( 2n1zwCPP ) -$250.70 This app I cash out almost every week and a half $ 10. The payout is quite high for this one. You basically request data for things like your Netflix viewing and apps like that. They are def. one I suggest the most.

4/13/24 Fetch- ( TP41AA ) -$237 I Love Fetch they have the best cash for your receipts. They also added a newer feature where deliveries also give you more ""points"" or cashback essential. I wish I had gotten this one sooner! It's the goat on this List lol

6/16/24 Caden- ( 7CC1A7 ) -$118.41 This one is a set and forget it. All you need to do is connect your airbnb, netflix, and others and it pays you daily until you reach a $45 Payout. I've cashed out twice with this one. I actually bought my groceries at one point when I had little to nothing. It was a real life savior!!

8/30/24 NCP- ( 394BA8C ) -$55.25 This app is another money for your Shopping info. They used to have these barcode scanners. Its switched to using your Phone to scan receipts or barcodes for a shopping trip. They always have big prizes & Sweepstakes which is cool but they give you more than one way to earn extra.
 
1/12/24 Receipt Hog (DM for link) -$52.50 This is a steady receipt scanning app that has a cute interface and is easy to navigate. They have a lot of extra ways to earn Coins as well.

6/14/24 Ibotta- ( pqcbrsy ) -$52.15 I Had this app afew years ago when I was heavy into my couponing era. I kinda forgot about it until midsummer last year. For this one you get cash back for specific items. But it's always about a dollar and up. Most items are $2-4 back

1/13/24 Frisbee ( DM for Link) $ 49.95 It is a receipt scanning app that is very fast and to the point. Not a lot of extras

1/12/24 ReceiptJar- ( HOPEPJ928 ) $46 It has a lower cashback but not by a lot just a little. But if I'm scanning receipts for other apps why not this one. The page is a little jumpy sometimes and I would suggest turning off the 2-step verification So you don't get extra emails for nothing lol

6/14/24 Coinout- ( DM for link ) $43.50 I got this one only 6 months ago. It has a huge payout for what it is. It's a fairly new app and has been adding new Features. I really like this one. It has the lowest payout cap at $3

8/27/24 Rakuten- ( DM for link ) $42.45 This one after it was suggested to me. I've had it for just a few months and have made a lot more than I expected! It is like Cashback and Rebates like 10%-12% cashback. Just type in the site or item and see if there are any available deals.

10/30/24 TopCashBack- ( DM for link ) $39.88 This app Is very similar to Rakuten but mostly because it's all cash backs. Just pick the webpage you want to purchase from and it will show you if you have any cashback available. 

2015 Honey- (DM for link) $38.57 I have had honey for so Long. I use it mostly for Promo codes, so I Don't have any clue how many promo codes or how much I Saved last year. But I did get several things for free last year, some clothes, also $100 chair For $9.99. And multiple edible gummies lol and I did include my cashback as well from just last year

6/14/24 Wewards- ( Refinedmosquito3991 ) $25.50 This is a walk for money app. When I first got this I didn't know how to use my points so I burnt through a few to many before I realized 😅 So I've only made a little off of it

6/14/24 Macadam- ( YE2YPC ) $21.97 This one takes awhile to get a cash out but I still feel it deserves a mention because it is also no nonsense. And an accurate tracker.
11/28/24 Drop- ( DM for link ) $12.11 Literally get this one 2 month ago and I've made money For linking my email to get a cashback. They have several ways to make more that do work as well. I'm still trying input but so far so good.

6/14/24 Evidation ( DM for link ) $9.95 This deserves a mention if you like tracking your health as well. It's slow going but It Asks you everyday your mood, your Stress level, and how well you slept. It has articles that you don't have to readjust click on to earn money and It will ask health related questions For larger amounts of points. 
 
Goodluck 💚💙💜👌",162,https://www.reddit.com/r/SavingMoney/comments/1iftr93/money_i_saved_and_made_off_of_walking_receipts/,1738488921.0,IdealExtension5302,1iftr93,not_advice_seeking
SavingMoney,what to do with extra money,What to do with refund from University?,"I have a lot of financial aid from my school and as a result I get refunds from the extra scholarship money I don’t use. I’m getting about $1600 back. Here are my stats:

IRA: $4500
Brokerage account: $1100
Savings: $7000 in HYSA
Checking I try to keep low and only use for “spending money”, so I don’t usually keep more than $300. 

Anyways, what should I do with the money? I definitely want to put some in my Roth but not sure how much. Some things to keep in mind:
-I want to study abroad next summer
-I don’t want to have too much money in savings in case it affects my Fafsa and I stop getting the financial aid I need.
-in case it matters I am going into my 2nd year at university and I am about to turn 20 in the fall.

SavingMoney,what to do with extra money,Any frugal tips for saving money. I’m a mom of a toddler and one on the way ,"In this economy it’s just rough. My husband has a good full time job and so do I. He also has a part time job and a small contracting job that makes a small amount of money on the side. Maybe like 200 a month. 

I really want to up my pay as I only make 57k a year and I’m trying my best to get promoted but my company is just not budging at this moment in time. 
I’ve looked at other jobs but this makes the most send right now as it is online and flexible. 

I have about 25k in savings just for liquid cash but trying my best to aggressively save and add on to that. My toddler and my unborn baby have savings account that I save for them and 529 plans. 

I would love to do something on the side to bring in extra money honestly. Even if it’s just 80-100 bucks a month that’s money I can put away or use for diapers and wipes. We budget and are frugal but who doesn’t want an extra few bucks to spend or save. I was thinking of selling some crafts I do on Etsy? I don’t know if I’ll have the time though 

Any thoughts on what to do?

SavingMoney,what to do with extra money,"Is SELF-REWARDING ""that costs money"" NECESSARY during your grinding for saving up more?","I am a student who is trying to live in my own budget.  Now I am on school holiday season which I do not need to care about my working hour restrictions. 

I have worked extra 15-20 hours a week in addition to what I normally do during my semesters.

Also I have started to keep track off any details of my expenses in and out from last month, and I have found out that I actually did save up way more than I expected as 

1. I have worked like 70 more hours than what I normally would in the last month. 

2. I have set capped expenses for each of my spending categories, and I have only spent around 200$ more than my capped amount for overall expenses. 

  
This month, I have analyzed my usage from last month and adjust my capped amount for each category REALISTICALLY.  Also, I am working like the same hours as last month. 

Regarding my intention of saving up, I DONT HAVE any specific target or goal ( I do not have school loan as my parents pay for those, I am not saving up to buy a car, nor a High Specs PC, nor any ). 

I wanna save up just because I think it would be beneficial in the future, if I face any emergency or have a certain goal. 

  
BUT THE PROBLEM is 

\- since I am working like a full timer during my semester break, I cannot enjoy as much as my friends do. Thus, sometimes after a hectic day, I feel like I wanna take a day off or hang out with my friends. Or sometimes I wanna buy myself  new sneakers, pants, etc as a reward for working hard. 

But alongside those thoughts, I immediately feel guilty for not being able to stick my Budget plan. But on the other hand, I feel myself "" Dump "" "" Wasting my Holiday Times "" for saving up money for NO SPECIFIC GOAL. 

  
What do you guys think of my Situation?

They only expect me to earn for my living expenses, which I can normally accomplish every month - Just I do not have any money saved up!!!! ) ",7,https://www.reddit.com/r/SavingMoney/comments/1ii6odw/is_selfrewarding_that_costs_money_necessary/,1738749413.0,HomesickPk,1ii6odw,advice_seeking
SavingMoney,what to do with extra money,Apps I made money off this year ,"I am new to reddit but I genuinely wanted to share my experience with these side hustles. My Spouse had major surgery in October of 2023 and was out of work recovering for 11 months so I had to look for extra income wherever I could so I started with anything I could find. But now that its 9 months into the year and things are calmer lol I just wanted to tell people about the real ones and how much I made. Some referrals are links so I took them off not to break any rules. Hope it helps (please don’t feel pressured to do any of these if you don’t want to though) 

Money Making apps 
Side Hustles for extra dough
This is a list of Money Making apps for people looking to make a little extra income passively. (referral codes included) In January of this year (2024) I started researching money making apps that actually work. I did find some that were not worth the time or just weren't right for me. I made sure to give them at least 6 months for each of them before I decided to keep it or delete it. Some I've only had For less than 6 month but are quite good So I'll put them on here and give my reasoning. ( Will also list my Cash out in total or on average)


Receipt Scanning/ E-reciepts / Cashback Apps - Favorites Last to First

Rakuten - 8/27/24 () $ 10.80 This one is a cash back app alot like Honey (which gives you cashback and finds you Coupons and promo codes) I just got it last month and got 12% back For a $100 Oil change. The cash out is every 3 months and they just drop the full amount it in your account on 2/15, 5/15, 8/15, 11/15.

Honey - This app I've had since 2015. Originally It was just on my PC but I use it to find promo codes for everything. It also has cash back for quite a few places. I couldn't tell you how much I've made honestly Since January of this year I've made $38.40 Cashback and countless promo codes lol

Frisbee - 1/13/24 $32.17 I do like receipt scanning apps some are a little slow to pay out, most of them give you more payouts the longer you use. This ones the slowest but still simple with no ads and the cashout works.

Ibotta - 6/14/24 $9.75( pqcbrsy ) This one is a cashback app. Look up the item on the app, select the cashback for the items available. Then just scan your receipts Or sometimes the item. I had this one in my extreme couponing era. It's pretty good.

Receipt Hog - 1/12/24 $26.55 ( gak28203 ) Its acute app Easy to use  It's not the biggest payout but if Im snapping pics For other receipt apps might as well for this legit one too well worth it. The payouts work

Receipt Jar - 1/12/24 $37.18 ( HOPEPJ128 )This one gives you more the longer you're a member but for a lot of the Ereceipts you need to refresh the Connection once a week or so. Just do it when you snap pics of your paper receipts though and it downloads them with the correct points.

Coinout - 6/14/24 $ 20.75 Very Quick money took me less than a month to reach their ""Diamond level” which just means a higher payout for each receipt and bigger rewards. I haven't had it as long as the others but it's up there in my Favorites. It's also got as low as $3 payouts

NCP - 8/30/24 $ 25.35 I had applied to be on this one at sometime this year and got on a waitlist. I heard about the National Consumer Panel in my couponing days but never applied. I do like this one. It's not scanning receipts though. It's scanning barcodes and entering amounts. I will say it does take a little longer for Big shopping trip but it's kinda fun to me. So to each their own

Fetch - 4/13/24 $106.92 ( TP41AA ) Wow love this app. Just try it for real. They give big bonuses for a lot of stuff! Fun interface. This one I wish I had found sooner! Love this App 5 stars.

Bridge Money - 6/28/24 () $8.33 This one It just tracks my spending and gives me cash back for Online receipts. Just claim your cashback then cashout later. I will say when originally researching this one people mentioned it being a little difficult to Cash Out whenever they wanted. I guess there is a time of day when you can… but I have only had it for 2 months so I'll update you when I do cash out for the first time

Caden - 6/16/24 ( 7CC1A7 ) $ 67.45 Like Wow. This one you just connect your netflix account, airbn b ,and some other accounts set it and forget it. And it quietly makes you extra cash in the background. There's a $40 cash out because any less they'd have to charge you. but it took me less than a month and half to make that. I Love this app I recommend It as my Second Favorite 😍 

MSR - 1/12/24 ( 2n1zwCPP ) $ 155.97 This is my Favorite App by far. Not only has the payout gotten larger since downloading it. But I Cashout $ 10 every 2 weeks from this one. There's 2 minute tutorial videos for Each request if you can't figure out how to request your data for things like netflix and Snapchat. But After doing it once or twice it's easy to remember


Walking / Health Apps - Favorites Last to First

Sweatcoin - 6/14/24 It is a good app for health nuts . BUT there isn't a way to cash out or earn actual US Currency. It's all crypto and you have to download two apps. ‘Sweatcoin’ and ‘Sweatcoin wallet’ to earn crypto. I didn't realize this until last month lol. I was using points for sweepstakes and waiting to see if I won anything. I wish I could accurately say how much I earned but I genuinely have no clue what my total would be hadI connected it to ‘Sweatcoin wallet‘ in the first place. There are in app deals for health related products so it is my Honorable mention.

Weward - 6/14/24 ( HxPE-Ktvu* ) $10.92 Most of all my walking apps I've only had them for about two months but this is one I'm keeping (I deleted so many walking apps because the Ads and them being Big ole scams like Freakin PaidToGo). I just connect my Apple Health on the app and just convert my steps before midnight. It's slow money but a good app.

Macadam - 6/14/24 ( YE2YPC ) $ 5.58 This app is so cute It has the highest amount of steps that can be converted (almost all Step for cash apps have a cap limit like Paidtogo’s is 12500 steps per day and macadams 20,000 ) I genuinely like the interface and just convert your steps before midnight. They also have no hidden ads

Evidation - 6/14/24 () $ 6.36 This also tracks your steps but you just check it once a day Tell them your mood, how good of sleep you got, and your stress level. Easy peasy. They have random health articles to read For extra $ but you just gotta open and close them to get your reward. Some I do actually read though because this ones also a really Easy app

SavingMoney,what to do with extra money,Money advice needed,"Hello everyone. I am currently living in Spain as an English teacher, making 800€ a month. On top of that I do extra tutoring in the side and make 200-300€ extra. I love Spain and want to move here permanently, but I am worried about my finances, and wages are low here. I’m 22 and have 6-7k in savings. My rent+bills is around 320€ a month, and the rest is for groceries, eating out, shopping, travel, etc. I’m trying to be really careful with my money, but I end up spending the majority of my income. I feel like I am behind financially for my age. I more so just need someone to tell me if the amount in my savings is reasonable for my age, and what steps I should take to get myself into a better financial position. Is investing the little i have left over worth it or too risky? And if anyone has done something similar to this, do you have any advice for getting more work in Spain or remote work?

SavingMoney,what to do with extra money,Dream Car or Savings?,"Hey guys. I’m 25 in a few months and a huge car enthusiast. I currently work as a Senior Account Executive with a salary of £33,000. I have a LISA with my partner to save for a house and we’d be looking to buy somewhere around 5 years from now. 

I’ve been driving since I was 18 but only hatchbacks as insurance in the UK meant I couldn’t afford anything else. I would consider myself to be quite a logical person hence why I’m having a consistent battle with my heart and head. Growing up I always wanted an E92 M3 but when the F82 M4 came onto the market, I knew I had to have it one day. I’m now in a position where I could do that if I wanted. 

I would have to finance it, putting around 10-20% down (the M4 costing me around £25k with a mileage around 40k miles on the clock). That would leave me with a monthly finance of around £400 over 5 years and insurance around £200. After all my expenses minus my current Corsa also on finance, I would have around £1,600. I would sell my current car to pay off the remaining finance and I might have some money left from that. If I kept my current car I would be paying £300 a month for the insurance and finance. 

I also know that it wouldn’t just be an extra £400 a month on the car finance and insurance for the M4 as the car would need the overall maintenance and servicing and drink more petrol (as well as use premium petrol), and that would add up. 

I know I’m still young but I do worry that once me and my partner get a house and start a family, I wouldn’t have that chance to own the car I dream of and am proud of, especially being the primary earner out of us. I’m not too sure what to do and would love some insight.",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SavingMoney/comments/1ekzqdd/dream_car_or_savings/,1722893302.0,Obvious-Camera152,1ekzqdd,advice_seeking
SavingMoney,bonus invest,Terrible at Saving but Addicted to Investing,"Like the title goes, I am terrible at having cash in my checking or saving account. I can't have more than $2,000 in my saving account because psychologically, I imagine I only need $2,000 for an emergency expense and I treat the rest in my checking as money I have to spend on food or travel. Recently, I got a  $4,000 bonus and decided to add it to my savings account but somehow I squandered it on an unplanned trip.

Conversely, I am very good at not touching money in my investment or brokerage account. I get so eager and excited to buy assets so I automate the deposits. Anytime I get any extra cash, I think about transferring it to my brokerage instead of adding it to my savings account for an emergency. 

I know $2,000 in savings is too small for an emergency.

I hope all is well. I’m 26 years old and currently working full-time in Human Resources with a base salary of $60,000 plus an annual bonus of about $7,000. I’ve managed to save $11,600 in a high-yield savings account and have around $8,000 in my 401(k), which I’ve been contributing to for the past three years post-graduating from university. 

I’m trying to figure out what my next financial steps should be. A few questions I’m wrestling with:

* Should I be contributing more aggressively to my 401(k) or consider opening a Roth IRA?
* Would it be smarter to invest some of my savings instead of letting it sit in a HYSA?
* At my income level, how much should I realistically be saving/investing monthly? I am working on paying off $9k in credit card debt. I am putting $1,000 on the cc debt a month, $500 a month into HYSA, and I have $1,050 in monthly bills.
* Any advice on how to grow my salary or pivot in HR for better long-term prospects?

Open to any general feedback as well — I’m just trying to set myself up well for the future and make sure I’m not leaving money on the table. My main goal is to save for a down payment on a small starter home/condo/townhouse/etc. and have enough for savings after buying one.

SavingMoney,bonus invest,24M | NYC | $75K Income – Am I on the Right Track Financially?,"Hey all! I’m pretty new to managing my finances and wanted to share where I’m at to get some perspective.

Graduated in 2024, first job out of college paid $42K at a record label — not sustainable in NYC. By Feb 2025, I transitioned to a new role paying $75K base + 10% bonus. I spent around $3K moving out of a rough housing situation (furniture, deposits, etc.).

Current Situation:

HYSA: $7.5K / 
Rollover IRA: $3K / 
Investments (VOO): $1K / 
Checking: $2K / 
Debt: $0 credit card, $30K student loans (on SAVE, forbearance until Summer 2026)

Monthly Savings:

401k: 8% Roth + 2% Traditional (employer match) / 
HYSA/VOO: $1,000/month (HYSA auto, then I transfer to VOO when I can)

I use CoPilot for budgeting, pay off credit cards daily, cook most meals, and really try to live below my means. Some days I feel super accomplished, other days I feel way behind when I hear how much others are saving or investing.

I’m on track to have around $22K saved across my HYSA and investments by the end of 2025, and my goal is to hit $100K saved across all accounts by age 30 (2031).

I feel like I have to be so careful with my spending, but everyone else I know “appears” to not have the same concerns. Do most people just not save? Am I doing okay? I’m considering picking up freelance work to help accelerate my progress.",12,https://www.reddit.com/r/SavingMoney/comments/1l9dx1b/24m_nyc_75k_income_am_i_on_the_right_track/,1749704111.0,CapitalWestern1690,1l9dx1b,advice_seeking
SavingMoney,bonus invest,How to start saving & investing young...background on how I was raised with Financially,"For some background I live in NYC (HCOL) so I feel more pressure to keep trying to increase my salary. I have this fear of just never being able to feel comfortable financially.. (24 F) 

When I say I ""Don't end up my like parents"" I mean I want to be comfortable and not worry about money in 60s, I want to be able to travel with my kids and give them vacations, and more than anything I want time which is the most valuable thing money can give you. I grew up in what many would consider ""upper class"", I lived in a nice house in a historic neighborhood in Maryland, attended a private school, and always had what I ""needed"". From the outside looking in you would assume my dad was well off, he is older (so was always older than my friends parents), very intelligent, and comes off a natural leader. My parents got married at 36 and 43 and had all us 4 kids within 5 years or so, I don't believe this to had been a marriage deemed by irresistible love. More so my mom was reaching the age where she wanted to start a family, her and my dad dated ended up getting pregnant with my sister and the rest is history! My mother believed my dad to be well off so I think she saw a comfortable life ahead for herself. She immediately stopped working after having my sister, and hasn't since.

More background a bit my dad has always just been BAD with money. He was a bachelor most his life (never thought he would get married or have kids) so he spent as he pleased, nice gyms, cars, nicer apartments, etc. He always had a good salary 200-300k but just never saved, invested in stupid businesses, loves high quality groceries stores. Then 4 kids came quick and I think he freaked out a bit and still wanted to pretend he was a bachelor, oftentimes getting an apartment in the city he was working in and leaving my siblings and mom behind for majority of the week.

Fast forward to now my parents are still together (I don't think they would be if my mom had her own source of income but she relies heavily on my dad). My parents are 71 & 65, they still in our home but its falling apart (old historic home) and needs so much work done to it. It was an expensive house too probably around 900.5k when we bought now worth slightly over 1 mil.

Anyways let me get to the point. I have chronic stress about my parents passing away (god forbid) and me and my siblings left with this debt. My dad has always just been sketchy never talks about how much $$ he has, but acts like he has a lot. We didn't have a fridge for two years because my dad could not afford to buy a new one and has terrible credit to put on a CC. He pays for my student loans which are a staggering 145k and it makes me SICK, thinking about the number. He has promised to pay this off for me (as he drained me and my siblings college accounts when we were 5 for his personal endeavors) never told my mom and she found out later..Anyways I love my dad but he is 70 has his own business he's been trying to sell for years but nothing, he says if he dies his life insurance will cover my student debt but I just doubt that my mom's gonna need the money not to mention the house isnt paid off and hes 70!!! Honestly just really makes me upset to think too much about

Overall ranting/looking for advice and if anyone else can relate to growing up in a 1% environment but never actually being that 1%. I'm grateful my parents sent me to private school but I also was never in the ""know"" about anything finance wise, like if I didnt go maybe that $$ could have gone towards college. Financial literacy has been something I have taught myself and I really want to avoid ending up like them, and would love to be able to help eventually.

So for me personally so far I have: Salary 75k, 30k bonus in December 2024

19.8k in HYSA

20k in 401K

trying to currently get into buying some ETFS.

Any help appreciated this was kind of ranty but if you took the time to read would really love feedback or just comments! Thanks!",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SavingMoney/comments/1l8wasu/how_to_start_saving_investing_youngbackground_on/,1749657312.0,Antique_String_5110,1l8wasu,advice_seeking
SavingMoney,bonus invest,Need advice,"Hi everyone,

Question A)

My wife and I live in a fairly high cost of living area. We are completely debt free besides our mortgage. 30 year, 3.19%, 495k balance. Two paid off, low mileage and basically new vehicles. Needing a new vehicle shouldn’t be a concern any time soon. Combined salary 171k plus bonus each year. We are both 36 years old. Kids currently aren’t in the plan for us. Maybe adoption someday.

If we know our home isn’t our forever home, should we still work to pay it off? I may be looking at it wrong, but if we know we won’t stay here forever it seems like it doesn’t make a lot of sense to pay down the mortgage. I believe we will just sell it, take the equity and move somewhere cheaper down the line.

I would rather put that money towards aggressively saving for retirement now, am I wrong? Current situation.

50k emergency fund 20k total in roth iras (started for the 2024 year) Just over 110k in 401ks combined

We know we are behind but working to make up ground. At this point going forward, we should be able to save a minimum 40k a year for retirement. Likely even higher and increasing each year. Say we “only” get a return of 8% on our investments, saving up seems to make more sense to earn the compounding growth vs paying down a low interest rate. Please let me know if my thinking is out of line.

Question B)

What do you guys actually put away each month for “fun money”. Certain percentage of income? This is what we do each month. Is it too much?

Vacation savings $550 Activities/date nights $300 My money $250 Her money $250

That seems like a lot of money to blow on paper, but sometimes it feels like not enough (even though I know it is) the plan here is to take any salary increases we receive in the future and split it 50/50 between saving and our fun accounts.

Insight and constructive criticism is welcome. Thanks in advance!",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/SavingMoney/comments/1lfa7oz/need_advice/,1750338008.0,RuhRoh702,1lfa7oz,advice_seeking

I (25M) have been on this sub sparingly amongst other money/finance related subs and I’ve recently decided to review all my money and set forth a plan for the future to build and optimize my savings. Currently, I have $4.3k between liquid savings and investments. I also have roughly $500-$1500 in cash per month that I want to appropriately allocate towards my goals (breakdown below). I am moving to a new apartment and going to be saving about 3x more than I currently am right now and I’d love to get some feedback or any perspective on what I should do to make the most of my money moving forward or at least be aware about. I also currently track everything through the credit karma app and would be open to hearing if anyone prefers another budgeting/finance app for net worth breakdowns. 

Background:

* Net pay after taxes, insurance, and pension contributions (maxed to company’s match): $2.1k assuming 26 pay periods per year would be $4550/month (roughly $5500/month if I include bonuses, travel per diems, and miscellaneous income from eBay or family throughout the year). 
* No outstanding student loans or credit card debt. 

Savings:

* Navy Federal Savings (and Checking): $3.3k 
* Fidelity
   * Individual Investment Account: $962 - all in FXIAX 
   * ROTH IRA: $22.2k (auto invest of $150 per month - $8.4k FFIJX & $13.8k FFAIX)

Expenses (monthly):

* Rent & Utilities: $1.5k
* Other Expenses (dining, travel, fitness, auto, shopping, etc.): $3k 

Goals:

* Emergency fund: I want to get my emergency fund to $20k.
* Save for a car: The car I have now is an SUV and over 12 years old. I’m not hoping to get a new one soon but would hope to have about $10k to comfortably finance a new one in case of an emergency.
* Save for a house: Ultimately houses are $600k-$800k in my area and would like to work towards owning a house in the future but unsure how long that will take given my circumstances.

SavingMoney,getting started investing,We hit $1M networth,"My husband (36M) and I (35f) have just crossed $1M net worth. We’ve been working towards this for 13 years. When we started, combined income was ~$75K working relatively blue collar jobs. We had bought our first house, had a combined debt of around $35K - lived a very tight budget and were socking away what we could. I had a college degree and he had dropped out. 

Our combined income this year will be around $375K, the highest it’s ever been by 30-35%. We’ve gotten here on our own and I’m so incredibly proud. Over the years, we have paid off our debt (besides a $300K mortgage), been very careful of what we bought. Both completed MBAs paid for in cash and bankrolled his flight training in cash as well. He has started his dream pilot job recently with the very likely total earnings for the next 30 years of $10M+. We have high life insurance policy through his work ($3M) and they have insurance to also cover annual earnings if something causes his license to go away (medical issue,etc)

We have 2 kids, prek/1st grade age. I’m ready to exit the workforce in a year or less to focus on our kids (he’s on the road 10-15 days a month). For all intents and purposes, I should be able to. But, we hustled so hard to get here, it’s hard to walk away from my very high paying tech job. I’m burnt out from being the primary breadwinner/caregiver/homemaker - it’s been a grind the last 5 years with little kids as he got through the low paying, high time away flying jobs. It was a necessary evil to get him in his dream, high paying pilot job. We don’t have outlandish bills so our outflows aren’t huge. We’ve been saving for so long it’s hard to reorient. 

NW Allocation:

$200K in home equity 
$25K HYSA 
$90K investments 
$700K in 401Ks

We will start 529s for the kids this year and max them out annually moving forward. Also anticipate another 20K in the HYSA by the end of the year.

I’ll give a quick rundown about me and my financial situation and would love to hear if you guys think I’m doing well for my age, on a good track, and anything you may recommended.

27 years old, pharmacist, ~$125k/salary, $105k in savings, $44k in my 401k at 10% contribution, only $1500 in my Roth from 2 years ago (but I plan to put $7k in before April 15th and claim it as a 2024 fund). Currently THE ONLY DEBT I HAVE is $145k in student loan debt (still in forbearance and no payment necessary at the moment). Car is paid off. Only expenses I have are monthly rent, car registration yearly, and car insurance every 6 months. 

I know there is no “right answer”, but should I maybe invest in a multi-family home as my first step, 3% down or whatever and gain passive income and build equity, versus just wiping out my loans and being left with essentially no money in my savings? I know paying off debts are important, but at the start of becoming a pharmacist I was about $175k in debt, so in 2-3 years I’ve paid off like $30-40k in debt already.

Then I'll get 30 extra community college credits to qualify for the CPA, take the exams, get experience, my license. And work up the career ladder. I may go into another business field as well such as financial planning but this is what I'm set on.

While I'm in community college I'll get DEA benefits every month and I've been looking for a job for ages in this economy. I'm also starting a small reselling business to save money. However, I always feel like I'm MISSING SOMETHING because I feel like in America there's so much to know. Here are the generals I have down:

Community college is key, don't get a car until you have a stable income and money saved (I'm waiting until after community college so I can save at least 30k), major in something useful that teaches you skills, stay with your parents and save up as much as you can, build up some credit, start investing into a 401k / Roth IRA once you're 18-21, make an emergency fund (or just save up as much as you can), get a high yield savings account for that emergency fund, pay off your student loans before the 6 month-after-college countdown, living with a roommate or partner is essential if you can't live with your parents, you need to learn to budget but since I'm with my Dad he is only making me pay small bills and making me buy my own clothes, get insurance when you have stable income (car insurance is near $300 a month, I might not ever get a car), live below your means, and I know there's a lot more.

Please comment, what else should all 18-25 year olds know? I read through the personal finance sub thread so basically I have all of those down, but what else?

SavingMoney,getting started investing,How much should I be saving?,"Hi everyone,

I’m looking for advice on saving and managing my finances. For some background:

* **Income**: I’ve been earning $215k-$225k per year for the past 1.3 years.
* **Past Financial Struggles**: Before this, I spent most of my life living paycheck to paycheck. Up until 2.5 years ago, I was barely able to save while paying off debts.
* **Current Savings**: I have $20k saved up so far.
* **Debt**: I currently owe $1,300, but I’ll be paying that off on Friday.
* **Age**: I’m 32.
* **Financial Background**: I grew up very poor, and I’ve never had anyone teach me about money management or saving.

Now that I’m finally in a position to save and think about the future, I’m feeling a little lost. I know I’m behind compared to some, but I want to build a solid plan moving forward.

How much should I aim to save monthly or yearly? Are there specific percentages I should focus on for savings, investments, or other financial goals?

I’d really appreciate any advice, especially from those who’ve been in similar situations.

Thanks in advance for your help!

***EDIT/Additional Context***:

I wanted to provide more context about my situation because I’ve received some helpful advice, but also some assumptions that don’t reflect my reality.

In my early adulthood, I lost two immediate family members within a very short period of time. Coupled with my family’s poor financial situation, I’ve had to help support my remaining family members. I also dealt with substantial medical debt from years of not having insurance while facing health issues that required hospitalizations and procedures.

On top of that, I had student loans, a car note, and less than $1,000 of credit card debt. I grew up and still live in an expensive city, and up until two years ago, I was working 80-hour weeks to make ends meet and earn the certifications necessary to increase my salary and land my dream job.

Since getting promoted 1.3 years ago, I’ve:

* Paid off over $80k in debt
* Bought a car with cash
* Saved $20k
* Maxed out my 401(k)
* Started putting money into investments

This journey has been a long and challenging one, and I’m proud of what I’ve achieved so far. However, I’m still new to this and trying to figure out how best to plan for the future.

I really appreciate the advice from those who’ve offered constructive input. It’s been invaluable as I navigate this new chapter.

SavingMoney,getting started investing,Why do all personal finance apps SUCK? (And why do we keep abandoning them?),"Hello Reddit/Personal finance app users!!

I have using multiple apps from time to time and at last I always stick to the spreadsheets, cause all the apps out there are selling or upselling some financial products and pure money management app does not exits - there are many that do exits but they are so bad in UI/UX lots of manual entries and so many other issues.

Also I have seen lots of customer drop off these apps in 30 days, why are people are not using these apps what are the major problems the you guys are facing.

Seriously, what gives? Is it just me, or do most of these apps feel like they're designed to make *them* money, not help *us* manage ours better? I get the need to monetize, but when every other screen is a loan offer or an investment pitch, it just adds to the noise.

And the manual entry thing – it’s a killer! In 2025, who has the time to sit and punch in every chai and auto ride? It's like they *want* you to fail at tracking. If it's not seamless, it's not happening, right? The friction is just too high.

So, tell me, what are your biggest pet peeves?

* Is it the **clunky interface** that looks like it was designed in the stone age?
* The **endless manual data entry** that makes you want to tear your hair out?
* The **constant upselling** of financial products you don't need or want?
* Do they just **fail to keep you engaged** after the initial setup? Like, there's no real *hook* to make you come back daily?
* Maybe they **don't actually help you build better habits**? It's just numbers on a screen without any real guidance or nudge to do better?
* Or is it something else entirely? **Privacy concerns** maybe? Or apps that just **drain your battery** like there's no tomorrow?

I’m trying to understand why so many of us start with good intentions but then just give up. It feels like a massive missed opportunity for an app to actually get this right – focusing on genuine financial discipline without all the fluff.

What would an app need to do to make *you* stick with it long-term and actually feel like it's making a positive impact on your financial habits?

Spill the beans, folks! Let's hear those frustrations.",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SavingMoney/comments/1kje5qu/why_do_all_personal_finance_apps_suck_and_why_do/,1746894308.0,Mundane-Voice-7591,1kje5qu,advice_seeking
SavingMoney,getting started investing,Best way to use the money I already have saved,"Hello, im currently trying to save enough money to start my own business. Had a bit of a collapse financially recently but im working hard to get back to track.

Im having to work a dead end job (in a fish factory) which isn't pleasant and its hard, but its allowing me save for what I really want to do.

Since September I have managed to save 4.5k and have set myself a 2 year goal which I will reach in order to save 15k. But I would love it to happen sooner. The 4.5k is just sitting in my current account, and im scared to do anything with it incase I lost it. Im just wondering what you would suggest would be the best way to invest it to make the money work for me. I have no idea about stocks, shares, etc, but I see people talking about this all time. I did resign myself to just hitting my target the hard and safe way, but am I being stupid by doing this. im saving about 500 a month, so should I just stick with doing it this way and be patient, or is there a better way I don't know about.

any help would be appreciated.

SavingMoney,how much to save,Here's how we managed to spend 30% less in the last 6 months,"My fiancé and I are trying to buy a place of our own. We can't borrow money from banks, since that's impossible unless you have a large and steady salary where we live, and we don't, nor do we know people who we could borrow money from.

Coming up with enough money for an apartment is a herculean task, no matter where you live. So we've decided to focus on that goal, regardless of how much we have to work, or how frugal we have to become.

Here is how we managed to spend **31.2% less** in the last 6 months compared to the previous 6 months.

**1. A monthly spending limit.** If we reach it, we cannot spend a single dime. That's it. Hungry? Figure it out! This has never happened yet. The limit is low, but reasonable, and we can stay below it without having to compromise or lose out on basic needs.

**2. No subscriptions.** Basically everything we've been subscribed to has been cancelled. Everything. We watch free stuff, listen to free music, etc. This has saved over **$100/month**. Everything we had been subscribed to had been a luxury.

**3. No takeaways/ordering in/eating in restaurants.** We don't compromise on food quality. In fact, we eat very healthy food, almost always bought from small local farmers, and we probably spend more on groceries than most people. We cook ourselves. It's cheaper, healthier, and we do more stuff together. It's very pleasurable to choose recipes and figure stuff out together. We used to spend **$320/month** on average on food that wasn't home cooked. We ended up spending $210 less on food each month on average because of this.

**4. Biking/walking instead of driving** anywhere within a reasonable distance. We still drive if we have to, but if we can avoid it, we walk or ride our bikes. This has saved us **$80/month** on average.

**5. No buying clothes/shoes** unless we have no replacement at home. We always do. We had only spent **$72** total on shoes and clothes in the previous 6 months so this isn't a major factor, but it may be for some of you.

**6. Coffee at home only.** We used to spend **$120/month** on average on coffee in bars or buying coffee to go. We have an espresso machine, we bought 4 thermic to go cups, and we can make any type of coffee we want and carry it with us.

**7. Cooking food for our dogs.** We used to buy dog food. Hugh quality too. We would spend $230/month on average on our two dogs, food and treats combined. Now we cook them meals with real meat, sometimes rice, sometimes legumes to go with it. They love it! And we spend **$112/month** less on average!

Being frugal alone will not get us an apartment. We have also started working several jobs in order to speed up the process. In 4 years, if all goes well, we should be able to buy our own place!

SavingMoney,savings rate,"2024 Savings Rate Round Up, plus 2025 Plans 💰","Hey everyone!

2024 has been a year full of ups and downs, and I’m curious—how did everyone do with their savings goals this year? Whether you saved a little, a lot, or struggled to save at all, I’d love to hear about your experience!

For me, I managed to save **50% of my income**, but it wasn’t always easy. Here’s how I broke it down:

* **30%** went into investments for the future.
* **20%** was set aside in a high-yield savings account for short-term goals, like a vacation fund.

I’ll be honest, finding balance was tricky! I wanted to save aggressively but still enjoy life. I ended up taking two big trips this year, and while they were amazing, I’m now rethinking how to prioritize my savings for 2025.

Next year, I’m considering increasing my investing percentage since I am over 40, but I’m not sure yet.

What about you?

* What was your savings rate in 2024?
* Did you hit your goals, or did something unexpected come up?
* What adjustments are you planning for 2025?

SavingMoney,build emergency fund,What Happens With No Emergency Fund?,"Living without an emergency fund might feel fine until life throws you a curveball. Here is what can happen when you do not have that safety net:

**Unexpected Expenses = Debt Spiral**  
Car repairs, medical bills, or job loss can force you to rely on credit cards or loans. Interest piles up, making recovery even harder.

**Stress Amplifies Poor Decisions**  
Financial pressure clouds your judgment, leading to hasty, short-term fixes instead of thoughtful, long-term solutions.

**Limited Options**  
Without savings, you are forced into “survival mode,” often choosing what is cheapest instead of what’s best for your future.

Building an emergency fund, even a small one, gives you control over your decisions and peace of mind. Start small, save $500, then aim for 3–6 months’ expenses. It is worth it.

SavingMoney,build emergency fund,I miss making frivolous purchases.,"I am generally a pretty responsible person, but in the past couple of years I completely demolished my savings on food, alcohol, and general irresponsible and frivolous spending. I learned that I need to surround myself with financially responsible people because I don’t do well with temptation. 


Starting in January of this year, I decided to take control of my finances and have been aggressively saving back up to where I was prior to “those” years. I’ve been doing really well. I currently have 6 out of 9 months emergency savings back, and I’m also building back up my Sinking funds for future big purchases. 


I have a small budget of $100/month for things like take-out, drinks, and “other” discretionary things but I am really starting to struggle with not having the same freedom I had before. 


Example: I woke up today wanting to buy a new video game that’s $40. It’s Saturday, I have no plans because I’m saving money, and therefore I’m bored to death and all I can think about is how much better my life would be with that video game. 


I miss just thinking “hey, I want this thing” and then just… getting it. 


Before “those” years, I was more responsible but I also had more freedom. I’d still have gotten the game, I just wouldn’t have spent $100/week on alcohol on top of that. I want to go back to those days. But I still have a ways to go until I’m as financially secure as I was before.

SavingMoney,build emergency fund,Savings or S&S ISA?,"Hello everyone,

I have recently been looking at moving some money around in my savings but not sure if it’s the best way forward.

So currently I have £700 in my trading 212 Isa and it’s something I’m really looking into at the minute and focused on building due to long term investing.

However I have £4700 in my trading 212 Cash ISA With £10150 in my Money box LISA.

I have been playing about with the idea of moving the majority of my cash isa into my s&s isa roughly about £3200 so then I still have £1500 to act as an emergency fund.

However the only contradiction in this scenario is the fact that I think saving more money into that Cash isa each month is okay because when the new tax year comes about in April I can max out My LISA in one go and don’t have to worry about finding £333 every month. 

I also have a vanguard personal pension with £1075 in which £100 gets added to every month. Could there be a possibility I move the money into there?

Personally I think I should leave the money in the CASH ISA for the new tax year but I just wanted to see what others thoughts are.

Thank you for reading

I’m currently 18M £21000 a year before tax.

All my savings just sit in my TD checking account, but I wanted to put it all into some type of account with high interest so my money can grow just by sitting there and continuing to save.

I was going to open a HYSA (haven’t decided where) but after being introduced to CD’s and a money market account, *which I still don’t quite understand the difference from hysa*, I don’t know what’s the best option or what I should put my savings into.

I’m not saving for anything particularly as this is just money I’m putting away for when I’m older so I have it or just whenever I need it like an emergency fund. That is kind of why I was thinking to go for a hysa because I was told that’s better emergency funds because of liquidity. 

However, since I’m young and don’t really have much expenses, I was wondering if putting my money into a CD would be better because of the higher apy and not really using the money I’m putting away other than to just let it build up. I’m also not sure what these “savings” are considered like if this is an emergency fund or what. 

I was also wondering what I should pick to open an account with? I heard Marcus, Ally, Capital one, American Express, and Discover was good. Hard to pick from so many as I don’t know what the difference really other than interest rates and functionality.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SavingMoney/comments/1kshe21/where_should_i_start_putting_my_savings/,1747885691.0,Inevitable-Metal-248,1kshe21,advice_seeking

Nespresso Vertuo pods are crazy expensive!! $1.33 per pod when you buy refills from Amazon. 
So I started refilling myself for .25¢ per pod! 
I bought espresso beans from Costco for $13 a bag. It lasts me over a month, you keep the pod and peel the top off, clean the inside out and then you get the resealable top from Amazon along with the contraption that seals it back on which is not expensive and then you grind your beans up, put them in the pod, reseal the top and then you have new pods for 75% of the price!

SavingMoney,50/30/20 rule,Smart Money-Saving Tips For Single Moms: A Practical Guide To Financial Freedom,"Being a single mom means wearing multiple hats – from caregiver to breadwinner and everything in between. Managing finances can be particularly challenging, but with the right strategies, you can build a secure financial future for yourself and your children. Here's a comprehensive guide to help you save money and maximize your resources.

**Master Your Budget Basics**

Empower yourself with the foundation of financial stability that starts with a solid budget. Track every dollar coming in and going out. Use budget tracking apps or a simple spreadsheet to monitor your spending patterns. Set aside weekly time to review your finances and adjust your budget. Remember, you can't manage what you don't measure.

**Consider using the 50/30/20 rule:** allocate 50% of your income to necessities, 30% to wants, and 20% to savings and debt repayment. However, as a single parent, you might need to adjust these percentages to suit your situation better. The key is finding a sustainable balance that works for your family.

**Reduce Housing Costs**

Housing typically represents the most significant expense in any budget. Consider these strategies to lower your housing costs:

Look into housing assistance programs specifically designed for single parents. Many communities offer affordable housing options or rent subsidies. If you're renting, consider getting a roommate or moving to a cheaper area. For homeowners, refinancing your mortgage when rates are low could significantly reduce monthly payments, providing a sense of relief.

**Minimize Childcare Expenses**

Childcare costs can consume a substantial portion of your income. Get creative with childcare solutions:

Research local Head Start programs or subsidized daycare options—network with other single parents to arrange childcare swaps. Look into flexible work arrangements that allow you to work from home or adjust your schedule around school hours. Many employers now offer family-friendly policies – don't hesitate to discuss your needs with your supervisor.

**Slash Your Grocery Bill**

Food expenses can be controlled without sacrificing nutrition:

Plan your meals weekly and shop with a list to avoid impulse purchases. Buy in bulk when items are on sale, especially non-perishables and frequently used items. Learn to cook simple, nutritious meals from scratch – it's usually cheaper than processed foods or takeout. Take advantage of grocery store loyalty programs and cash-back apps for additional savings.

**Smart Shopping For Children's Needs**

Kids proliferate, and their needs constantly change. Stay ahead with these strategies:

Shop secondhand for clothing and equipment – children often outgrow items before wearing them out. Join local parent groups on social media to find free or discounted items. Time your purchases around sales cycles – buy winter clothes in spring and summer clothes in fall. Consider consignment shops for both buying and selling outgrown items.

**Maximize Tax Benefits**

Don't leave money on the table when it comes to taxes:

Ensure you claim all available tax credits and deductions, such as the Child and Earned Income Tax Credit. Keep accurate records of childcare expenses, which may be tax-deductible. Consider consulting a tax professional to maximize your return – the cost often pays for itself through increased refunds.

**Build Emergency Savings**

Financial security requires a safety net:

Start small, if necessary, but aim to build an emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses. Set up automatic transfers to a separate savings account – even $25 per paycheck adds up over time. Look for high-yield savings accounts to make your money work harder for you. Consider this fund untouchable except for true emergencies, giving you a sense of security and accomplishment.

**Reduce Energy Costs**

Lower utility bills mean more money in your pocket:

Implement energy-saving habits like turning off lights and unplugging unused electronics. Use programmable thermostats to optimize heating and cooling. Consider energy-efficient appliances when replacements are needed – the long-term savings often justify the initial investment.

**Find Free Family Activities**

Entertainment doesn't have to be expensive:

Take advantage of free community events and activities. Use your local library for books, movies, and activities. Explore nearby parks and nature areas for outdoor adventures. Look for museums with free admission days or family passes available through your library.

**Plan For The Future**

While immediate needs are pressing, don't neglect long-term planning:

Start retirement savings, even if it's a small amount initially. Look into life insurance options to protect your children's future. Consider setting up a 529 college savings plan – family members can contribute instead of gifts for special occasions.

**Conclusion**

Remember that financial security is a journey, not a destination. Don't be too hard on yourself if you can't implement all these strategies simultaneously. Start with what feels most manageable and gradually incorporate more changes as you build confidence and capability.

The most important thing is to take that first step toward better financial management. Your efforts to create economic stability will benefit you and set a powerful example for your children about responsibility and resilience.

Every small step counts toward your larger financial goals. Stay focused on your progress rather than comparing yourself to others, and celebrate your victories. You can build a secure financial foundation for your family's future with determination and thoughtful planning.",12,https://www.reddit.com/r/SavingMoney/comments/1hxxxpm/smart_moneysaving_tips_for_single_moms_a/,1736489082.0,dimeintime,1hxxxpm,advice_seeking

SavingMoney,credit card debt,How Bank Account Bonuses and Credit Cards Bring Me Profit,"When I was younger, I was searching for an easy way to make money. While such a method doesn’t really exist, I discovered an approach that I genuinely enjoyed — taking advantage of bank promotions. I’m not sure how it works in other countries, but in Poland, new customers often have a good chance to earn attractive bonuses.

Additionally, I discovered affiliate programs, which let me earn commissions by referring others to open bank accounts. To take advantage of this, I generated affiliate links and used them to open accounts myself.

The bonuses weren’t very large, typically ranging from 100 to 200 Polish zloty (PLN), or around $25 — $50, but for me, they served as a valuable supplement to my income. At the time, I had just started my career and wasn’t earning much.

My strategy was simple — I would open an account, meet the necessary conditions, claim the bonus, and then close the account. This allowed me to reopen an account with the same bank later as a new customer. Over time, I took advantage of promotions at every major bank in Poland.

Once I managed to set aside some savings, I started looking for promotions on deposits or savings accounts. Back then, interest rates were quite low. The best offers were around 4%, with the average being closer to 3%. Thanks to affiliate earnings and account bonuses, I managed to achieve a 7% return in one year — a result made possible precisely because my savings were relatively small.

I had been avoiding credit cards, but one offer caught my attention. It was hard to resist — over 100 PLN ($25) from the affiliate program plus 400 PLN ($100) shopping voucher for one of the most popular electronics stores.

I started learning how credit cards work, including the costs and how to avoid paying interest. My girlfriend (now my wife) was firmly against any form of credit. In fact, one of our first dates, she asked me if I had any outstanding debts — luckily, I could proudly say I was “debt-free”.

Despite her reservations, I decided to get the card, promising not to use it. My plan was simple: claim the bonus and cancel the card.

But this time, life had other plans. Before a routine shopping trip, I forgot to transfer money from my savings to my checking account, where I keep most of my cash to earn interest.

As you can probably guess, the only card I could use was the credit card. I paid with it in front of my future wife, and as soon as we got home, she immediately asked, somewhat sternly: “**How much interest did you pay?**”

SavingMoney,credit card debt,Thought I was good with money…until I started tracking it,"For a long time, I assumed I was pretty responsible with my finances. I didn’t buy expensive stuff, I paid my bills, and I avoided credit card debt. But month after month, I kept asking myself where did all my money go?

So I finally tried something I had always avoided which was tracking every single expense.

Not just rent and groceries. I mean $3 coffees, random Amazon purchases, subscriptions, etc. And it was a bit tedious at first, but it completely changed how I viewed my spending.

After a full year of doing this consistently, I saved over $6,000 without making more money or radically changing my lifestyle.

Here’s what worked for me:

• I categorized every expense (and was brutally honest about it)
• I set weekly goals instead of monthly ones, which helped me adjust in real time
• I reviewed my spending once a week consistently
• I used a simple budgeting tool that I could use in both my phone and laptop to add and track my transactions (can share it in the comments if anyone’s curious) 

What surprised me most is how much control I felt once I started. Budgeting stopped feeling restrictive and started feeling empowering.

If you’ve been feeling stuck or like your savings just aren’t growing, try tracking every dollar for 30 days.

SavingMoney,debt snowball,Credit or Cash,"Okay, so I’m pretty financially illiterate although I’ve been working on changing that since the last few years, sorta - 

So my parent passed in 2019 and I received a small lump of money in 2022. It’s now 2025, I have 20k in savings (HYSA) but I have also accrued about 22.5k in debt (4 credit cards, 3 nearly maxed). One card is 9.7k no interest til the end of May of this year. But another is 10.1k and interest/payments is almost 300/mo. I’m worried about the economy and state of things so I would prefer to keep cash on hand and slowly pay off debt…but is that just stupid? Should I just pay off the credit debt first since interest rates are so high that anything in my HYSA or Roth IRA won’t beat it? I’m just worried I’ll have nothing to fall back on. Except those cards if I pay them off, but then nothing for rent. Basically all my cash/income has been going toward rent since I got kicked out by my remaining parent and family and been putting car repairs, food and other necessities on credit and eventually stopped caring and let it snowball. I know bankruptcy is an option as well and in that case I’d move my cash to my Roth so it would hopefully be untouched if I filed Ch7/13. Any advice??? 

*Oh shit, forgot to add, I tried to invest in myself by signing up for this online course about Youtube Automation that was 7k but used Affirm payments which totaled to about 11k and I haven’t beeb keeping up with payments and receive daily calls and emails about the delinquency.

SavingMoney,student loan help,Deposit Leftover Student Loan into HYSA?,"I'm embarking on a Bachelor's degree this fall and I'm planning on taking our subsidized student loan to help pay for it. After doing the math, it should take me about 4 years to complete and it should cost about $20k. I have a full time job and could save and cash flow my way through this. But I rather take out a subsidized loan to pay for the entire cost each semester. This way I can have the money I would be using for school in a HYSA growing and in case an emergency comes along.

I plan on taking out subsidized loan to pay for school and then anything leftover (after tuition and books) each semester will be put into a HYSA. Alongside that I'm planning to put about $420 each month into that HYSA as well.

By the end of that four years (48 months) that should be $20,160 based on what I contribute alone in that account, not counting the leftover loan money and interest gained. After I graduate and before I need to start paying interest, I will take that amount and just pay off the entire balance of the $20k loan.

we were grossing $13k a month so that’s a great bump, thanks to my wife’s recent promotion, and i want to make sure we’re on the right track to save AND pay down debt, so far in H1 we’ve taken home $59k, spent $41k, saving $18k at a rate of 30% plus the 10% going to our 401ks before our take home. 

we have about $45k cash on hand in vaults for e fund, car fund (buying our lease in November), travel fund, and checking for bills. 

we don’t carry any balances on our credit cards and live a really cool life, working from home together and traveling often while doing so. we drive a nice car, rent in a nice, romatisizable (if that’s a word?) neighborhood. 

$7k/month does feel like a high spend but $1k is going to student loans while they’re in deferment on the SAVE plan and I think the plan is to put all the raise towards those. they’re about $60k total with int being ~5% so trying to pay down ASAP. No other debt. Our NW is righ about $100k with ~$120k saved towards retirement and saving 10% a month towards it in our 401ks. 

so what do you think? we have a budget and saving goals but overspent a couple categories last month so not doing perfectly. looking for advice here. we eat out too much and cutting back this month. we also get too many “little treats” so tips for avoiding the corner store and other things like that welcomed. 

we do try to do a lot of free/cheap stuff, walks, biking, lake days, etc. so more things like that are also of interest to me to help stave off the urge to spend more.

SavingMoney,student loan help,25F seeking financial advice ,"25F, new job, new business, how to grow my portfolio and set myself up for the future? 

Want some financial advice/direction. Nothing dramatic, but want to have an open discussion on healthy ways to save, money mindset, advice for financial future. I’m a 25F living in the bay area, California, USA.

A short summary of my financial status and history:

I work full time M-F, just started this new job in tech after leaving another tech company after 2 years. First time being on a salary (68k before taxes). I currently still live with my parents, and luckily they aren’t the type to demand money, yet I still contribute what I can and help out here and there. I pay my own insurance and registration.

-          I have around **$2200** in savings. For a while was saving 50 % of each check monthly since I don’t have any major bills. (Weekly deposits into savings account adds to about $2000 each month)

-          Less than **$400** in my 401k (only recently started through my last job, but new job doesn’t offer)

-          Around **$14,000** invested into crypto, the usual: BTC, XRP, SOL, ETH, and a few other coins. All time return is only around **$1600** , not expecting to pull anything out till after 2030 (was DCAing $100 weekly of BTC for over 10 months, but reduced to $30 weekly recently to grow my checking account)

-          Checking account is around **$6,000**

-          Less than $500 in credit card debt, but least of my concern as I don’t usually spend what I cant afford.

-          Repaying a student loan monthly, less than **$2000** left to pay off.

-          Have a car that I paid off some months ago.

My set back came from when I was 23. I started my own company, investing nearly 10K of my own money (before I understood leveraging credit). The business wasn’t growing, the market was tight, and one of our partners were going through a rough patch that affected overall process for my company. Made the tough decision to let the business go and take the 10k lost as a lesson. I figured since I was still young, I had time to explore a new business model.

I decided to do amazon FBA and just hire a VA for $300 a month, till this day im in about $1300 with 3 products listed. returns are slim to none but I would assume that’s how it is in the beginning (only about 4 months in from starting up).

What are some things I can do to get myself to the next level? I do feel the closing of my company set me back, and my spending habits started to become bad. (mainly food, drinking, partying etc, everything young adults would do). I also am not invested into any stocks, but have been wanting to get into that.

SavingMoney,buy vs rent,Saving money in college by not getting a car and staying with my Dad.,"I'm a 17 year old in high school and this job market has been so trash for me to the point that I won't be able to get a car once I turn 18. My Dad and I are lower-low middle class. I have a reselling small business so I make $300 - $500 a month, and I'm going to save it all up. This means that by the end of high school, I'll have at least $3,000. Technically I could get a cheap car, but then you have annoying insurance costs too. At first, I felt so bad about this. I used to get jealous of the idea of people getting a car at 18 and me not getting one at all. Then, I realized that this was an entitled way to think. My plans have now changed and I want your opinion on it.

First, I have completed my driving lessons and I'm going to get my license soon. I'll need this to drive my Dad's car every now and then. After that, I'm going to get a kick scooter, not an electric scooter. It's embarrassing to admit but I'm terrible at riding manual bikes so I'm just going to use a regular scooter. Then, I'm going to community college in my town for 2 years. My Dad is going to let me live with him, no rent, just helping around the home as usual and getting things off of his hands. I'll also be responsible for buying my own things such as clothes but I'm not a shopaholic. Him and I will handle food together. He is a 100% disabled veteran, so I get DEA student benefits, which are $1,500 a month while I go to college. In the meantime, no matter how TERRIBLE this job market is, I'm going to keep applying for jobs. While I'm in community college, long description short, no car, no paying rent, staying with my Dad and saving most of my money and building my credit too.

In community college, my goal will be to save $1,000 or more a month. Then, I'll go to university, which is also near my home. I'll go through the same process as in community college to save money in university: no car, staying with Dad, and hopefully having a job in this recession.

Yes I feel like I’m doing pretty good but then I think about proposing to my girlfriend and what comes with it. Affording an engagement ring, affording a wedding, houses nowadays in my HCOL area are extremely expensive at high interest rates. 
I believe the average salary for a 25 year old is probably 55k and most people aren’t blessed to live in their parents home for free till they are 25. How is the rest of the world surviving?

SavingMoney,afford a house,Suggestions for a college grad?,"After a pretty painful talk with my mom where she said that she would not endorse me moving in with my partner (we are in a queer relationship and she does not believe in living together before marriage) she said that she wouldn't assist in paying any of my rent when I graduate college to support us. I never expected her to-- I knew once I graduated, I would be on my own and paying my own rent entirely. But now that she has said this, I'm starting to get worried about my finances.

Currently, I have a little under 6k in my account. About 1.1k of that is from my parents in order to help me pay for rent in my current apartment, for another month; specifically, May. My lease runs until July, and I am prepared to pay a total of 3.4k for me to stay for the remainder of my lease. Previously, my parents have said they would help cover this cost while I am still in student housing, but after telling her about my decision to move in with my partner of almost two years, I wouldn't be surprised if she did decide to cut me off financially. I would be left with under 2.5k to take care of myself and my partner (who is currently employed and working on making money of his own)

While I am currently a full time student working on graduating as well as taking art and writing commissions for clients, I am also searching for jobs as well as affordable places where my partner and I can live. Thankfully, I do have a fair amount saved and am working a student job where I can earn a maximum of 150$ a week, but I am still concerned about where I will be once I graduate.

Doing a low/no buy challenge for myself to help curb unnecessary spending was helpful for me last month, and I want to find other tips like that. Are there any people in a similar situation as me that have any good suggestions? Let me know if I am in the wrong subreddit as well.

SavingMoney,afford a house,Car insurance financial help,"I’m looking for advice on what to do in this situation. My husband and I are living with in laws to save for a house. My husband was in a car accident a year ago and currently doesn’t drive due to his fear of driving. His car has been sitting in the driveway uninsured without being driven. I was thinking to sell my car (it is payed off) to get a jump start on saving for a house and I’ll drive his car since he doesn’t drive it anyway. However, looking a car insurance they are quoting us $1300 a month for insurance with both of us on it because of his previous car accident. 
I’m not sure what to do because with the car payment plus insurance it’s almost $2000 a month and we cannot afford that right now especially while trying to save for a house. Does anyone have any advice or guidance or cheap insurance providers? Ways to temporarily get around the high prices associated with an accident?

SavingMoney,first home,First Real Job at 32 After a PhD—Looking for Investment and Savings Advice,"Hi everyone,

I’m a 32-year-old South Asian guy who just wrapped up a PhD (finally!) and moved to California for a new job. During grad school, in an attempt to escape the ramen-budget lifestyle, I opened a Robinhood account and started dabbling in stocks and options—iron condors, debit/credit spreads, calls, puts… you name it, I probably blew money on it. After watching way too many YouTube videos that made it look easy, I learned the hard way that Wall Street doesn’t hand out free lunches. I lost a few thousand bucks and walked away with a painful but valuable lesson: options trading isn’t for the faint-hearted (or the underfunded PhD).

Fast forward to now—I’ve got a job and finally have the chance to save some real money. I maxed out my Roth IRA last year ($7k) through Robinhood and just enrolled in my company’s 401(k) via Fidelity. They offered contribution choices of 6%, 9%, or 12%, and I went with 9% for now. It seems they automatically invest in a target-date fund (something like “birth year 1990”), which feels safe-ish for a beginner.

I know a lot of people in the U.S. start building their financial life in their 20s, while I’ve just started mine in my 30s after years of surviving on grad student stipends. My wife also just finished her PhD and will be starting her career soon, so together we’ll be earning around $280k/year before taxes. We have a toddler, so we’re also thinking about opening a high-yield savings account (HYSA) and maybe an education account for our child. Our car is paid off, and we plan to rent for a few years before buying a home.

Now that we’re finally earning, I want to make smart, long-term decisions instead of playing financial roulette. I'd really appreciate any advice on where and how we should be investing—and what kind of percentages make sense at this stage.

Thanks in advance, and cheers to being financially clueless no more!",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/SavingMoney/comments/1lppe4q/first_real_job_at_32_after_a_phdlooking_for/,1751440333.0,Vegetable-Level906,1lppe4q,advice_seeking

SavingMoney,down payment savings,Keep saving vs large house down payment?,"First off, I’m grateful for the position I’m in right now. Over the past few years, I’ve been fortunate to see solid returns in the stock market, and while I took a few calculated risks, they’ve paid off well.

For context, I’m 25 years old and the sole provider for my wife and me while she completes dental school, which she has about 2.5 years left. I recently accepted a new job with an annual salary of $55k, and we’re planning to purchase a home around May.

Currently, I have $110k in a high-yield savings account, $15k in a brokerage account, and $6k in other savings. I’ve also saved $20k between my 403b and Roth IRA. We’re looking at homes in the $250k range, and I’m wondering if it would be wise to put the majority of my HYSA funds toward the down payment. I expect to save an additional $9k-12k by May.

My goal is to save up enough for a down payment on a rural plot of land through a USDA Ag loan. I live in Dallas and currently looking at areas within an hour of the city. There are a few areas that qualify. 

My question is does it make more sense to focus savings on a high yield savings account or on long term savings via 401K. The savings account averages 4.3% and the 401K matches at 50% up to 6% of my check. So $100 taken out, yields $150 in savings.

financialindependence,invest $1000,"Relative is retirement age but needs to live on income from $250k cash. No other assets, no home. What to do?","I have a relative at retirement age with no assets except $250k cash. But they also have no real expenses (small amounts only for food, gas, insurance), as they live with an elderly parent, for now, but they might not within 2-4 years, so they need to figure out a game plan to be on their own in the future. They make only about $1000/mo, which is from SS and a small pension. In the near future, they have the option of building a small home (ADU on a child's property) for about $175k so they don't have to pay really expensive rent somewhere. 

I've been on the traditional FIRE path for a while, so I'm unsure how to advise them on how to live off the $250k without drawing it down. The traditional idea of a retirement-age person putting this cash into a low-risk investment (like bonds, t-bills, or high yield savings only) doesn't seem to fit, because it has no way of giving them sufficient income, and they need to maximize returns.

It almost seems like they should just park the money in VOO indefinitely, despite this being a ""higher-risk"" option, and just liquidating 4% a year or .25% of balance per month to live on. That way, at least they gain the relative advantage of market growth (compared with HYS account).

Is there a better plan than this, all things considered (age, risk, present/future expenses)?

Edit: appreciating the advice that ""retirement is a number, not an age"", and I agreed with it.

I think I'm going to resign today and want to get a second opinion on my plans.

**Background**

My family is me (38), my wife (36), and our daughter (3). I've been a software engineer in a US BigTech company since graduating college, and am feeling pretty burned out/bored. It's a weird combination because I can do all the work without much fuss; I just don't care at all about it and feel like there are better things to do with my time. In any case, I want to leave to spend time with my daughter before she starts school and also to try some side projects.

My wife works as a nurse in a non-bedside role, so she isn't destroying her body on a daily basis. She likes her job and sees herself doing it for a few years. She's worked off and on throughout our relationship and her view is that I've done my time and that it's now her turn.

**Finances**

- Net Worth: $3,650,000 (estimated)
- House: 1,000,000 (estimated, fully paid)
- Liquid Net Worth: 2,650,000
- Pre-Tax Net Worth: $917,000
- Roth IRAs: $123,000
- Taxable Investments: $1,543,000
- HSA: $77,000
- Debt: None

- My income: Roughly $400k/year, depending on RSU prices and bonuses
- My wife's income: $60k/year

Our expenses are broken down into categories: 

- Needs: $4568 / mo (bills, food, savings for daughter's college)
- Wants: $1675 / mo (fun money, eating out, hiring for jobs we could do ourselves, etc)
- Luxuries: $1000 / mo (travel and gifts)

This all adds up to a ""withdrawal rate"" of 3.27%. However, with my wife working, we expect to only withdraw about 1.3% to bridge the gap between her income and our spending.

Our target asset allocation is 50% US stocks, 30% international stocks, 9% us bonds, 9% international bonds, and 2% cash. It's drifted a little from that as I've lost the ability to buy my way back into balance over the years. Everything is in low-fee ETFs. 

**Risks**

- Sequence Risk / High valuations: I would like to pursue a bond tent, but I don't want to eat the capital gains to do such a large rebalancing. The plan to mitigate this risk is a few years of my wife working (virtual bonds) to lower our initial withdrawals and enough bonds to cover 3 years of expenses. As an RN, she's much more immune to layoffs than I am since people don't stop getting sick.

- Repeal of the ACA: The repeal of the ACA is a factor that would likely cause us to reconsider the entire plan. In this case, we would likely move abroad or continue working indefinitely.

- Return to work: This is often thrown around as an answer, but in a downturn I worry about my ability to actually find a job given that I would likely be several years out of the workforce and tech layoffs are frequent. The golden age of software engineering may be ending.

**The Plan**

This may seem overly conservative to many here. I hope it is, but 60 years is a long time to plan for. I've gotten more and more conservative with the numbers as I've gotten closer to FI. Basically, I want to die with at least as much as I have now, not necessarily to bequeath but to ensure security through our lives and to cover end of life / LTC expenses. The plan is for my wife to work for a few more years until our withdrawal rate hits roughly 3%. Assuming modest growth, this will only be a few years. She has been made aware that it could be much longer than that if we see a serious downturn. We plan to use a CAPE-based withdrawal strategy with 1.75% and 0.5 as the parameters.

Once I'm retired (tax year 2025), we'll start roth conversions from the pre-tax accounts to fill up the 10 and 12% income tax brackets. Additionally, we'll try to keep spending and sales of shares inside the 0% LTCG bracket. Overall, I don't expect our taxes in retirement to be huge (about 3k / year, coming all from conversions) and will be largely offset by the child tax credit. This is currently not included in our budget since we do have some flexibility around taking the tax hit or not in any given year.
 
Broadly, we have the ability to reduce our spending by a reasonable amount, though cutting all the way down to needs only wouldn't be too fun, but could be done for medical issues during a downturn. Barring a disaster, I don't expect us to have to do that since our needs + wants is only a 2.82% withdrawal rate today. Losing vacations would be a hit, but we still have plenty of nearby stuff to explore here. 

We expect a modest amount from Social Security. Our plans expect half the number that the SSA website estimates for us.

**Questions!**

- Is expecting half from social security reasonable? I don't think they can just give us nothing, but I also don't expect the full amount. I don't think it makes a *huge* difference, but curious how others are planning for this.
- I have a bit of leverage with my team right now. I'm the seniormost engineer by a wide margin, and a few people have left. Things are not ideal, so I think I'm in position to ask for more in exchange for staying a bit longer. Any experience with that? 
- Does this seem solid to you smart people? In my shoes, would you take the leap?",44,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1g52h48/would_you_call_it_quits/,1729093478.0,Extreme_Cobbler4599,1g52h48,advice_seeking
financialindependence,invest $1000,I’ve just found FIRE and I’m hooked,"Hi friends - bit of a background first. I graduated school in 2023 with *brace yourself* roughly $20,000 in credit card debt. I had no excuse for this. I grew up with affluent parents who paid for my college and taught me never to live beyond my means. 

In my senior year of school, I found myself having a decent job and a somewhat financially abusive relationship, and I just spent way more than what I realized. To make matters worse, I live in a HCOL city, and was paying 2700/month before utilities for a 1 bed my first year out of school. 

Fast forward to this past August. I started to become more and more obsessed with reaching my financial goals in the future. I made a budget and a pretty clear cut savings plan. I’ve paid down all debt, and my expenses/plan are as follows.


Remaining CC debt: roughly $4,000 (will be done in about 1.5 months, will never carry a balance again and only use cards for travel points, also worth noting I’m paying no interest on a 0% APR period, but point stands)


Salary: $97,600, take home is riiiight around $6k/mo, but it varies by hours in a pay period, and there is sometimes overtime available.

Car: paid off
Rent: $1675/mo, (2 bed w roommate)
Utilities: $150/mo
Subscriptions: $50/mo
Wifi: $10/mo
phone: $25/mo
Car insurance: $137/mo
Commute/gas: $60/mo (trying to look into company benefit for reimbursement)

After this, I spent $200/wk in groceries and any dining/ubers/dates/going out, and up to $600 a month used for miscellaneous activity. October was my trip to homecoming, November was Friendsgiving/holiday shopping, December was presents for my family and trip home, January is a hockey game with about $400 left over that will go to savings. 

I’ve thought a lot about the 200/wk, 600/mo, but the idea here is that I still allow myself room to enjoy my life. If I dedicate money entirely to savings, I’ll have a very difficult time not cutting out a lot of fun things in my life.

There are a few areas where I reeeaallly don’t want to compromise on spending:

1. My apartment. This is the most important. I WFH a lot, and I live in a great area in a nice place that I love and maintain very well, I believe the value I’m paying for the place I live is incredible, and it’s important to continue to live here for me. Everything including friends are super accessible and it’s a great place for my mental health. 

2. I really enjoy spending my time with friends/going out. That doesn’t mean spending $100/wk on alcohol, but it’s important that I have some money to make time for the things that I enjoy.

3. Lastly, I’ve loved to golf my whole life. Right now I can’t really afford it, but one goal that I’d really like to save for as I get raises in the coming future is a country club membership. They are egregiously expensive here, and this is really the only area that I care to allow “lifestyle creep”. I love to golf, i played with my dad a ton growing up, and I’d love to have a place for him to play a member guest tournament with me when he visits. 

As for savings:

Once my debt is paid off in the next two months or so, I plan to max my 401k, max my Roth IRA, and max my ESPP. My employer match on my 401k is 6%, and my ESPP is a 15% discount on shares that I’ll sell immediately and deposit to a brokerage. I won’t be able to do all of these until I get my next promotion/raise (fingers crossed for November), so until then, my plan is to max 401k and ESPP, and when ESPP is sold to deposit in the Roth, and deposit the rest in a brokerage. The amount I’ll be able to save monthly on my current salary (including match/espp discounting) should be right around 4k 

I’m currently 23, and invested in only the Russel 1000 growth index (and vanguard’s version of that in my 401k). I plan to keep it that way for at least the foreseeable future. As my salary grows, my intention is to fully max all three of the above accounts, and then once there is leftover, split the leftover amount between a high yield savings (for travel, golf, home down payment, engagement ring, etc) and a brokerage account and to continue to live on this $200/wk, $600/mo amount. 

I know how lucky I am. The credit card debt was a dumb young choice, but I’m making my attempt to rectify it so that I don’t waste the opportunity I’ve been given.


How would you change this plan? Do you have any better ideas/suggestions? I don’t fully know yet how having a family will impact everything here, but I’d like to think my income will have scaled enough then that it won’t affect the basic strategy here while providing for my kids. I don’t have a particular FIRE date in mind, I’d just like to be able to live freely, travel, and pretty much do whatever I want in my mid to late 50s.

financialindependence,invest $1000,What more can I be doing? Road to $1m,"UPDATE:  Want to thank everyone for their comments.  It really helped open our eyes that are biggest problem was budget.  We sat down and hammered out a detailed budget.  We found we had $2-$3k/month going to food, drinks, shopping, sports betting, just random stuff.   Based on our current plans now, we can continue to save at a higher rate that should get us close to $1mm in 7-10 years.  We are also going to aggressively pay off the car and start looking at new houses at a much lower price point.  Thank you all! Very inspiring! 

  
TLDR:  Sit down and make a budget!!!



Late starter in life but caught up quickly.  Married, 40 yrs old.  Total savings:

401ks - $160k

Roth IRA - $15k

Investment Account - $55k (saving this up for a home purchase)

Home Equity - $75k

Combined Gross Income - $325k annually

Current Debt:  $20k on a car loan

UPDATE Budget - $1k/month on mortgage, $500/car payment, $400/month on internet, phones, and subscriptions, $1000 on food, drinks, fun.  As I am typing this.... we need to budget things better.

I maxed out my 401k and started doing a mega back door roth this year that my employer offers.  I have an aggressive goal to get to $1m in savings and retirement by 50 years old.  We've been blessed to be able to contribute about 30-35% of our income to savings and honestly we could do more.  We do plan on buying a new house which will increase our current mortgage payment 3-4x (current mortage is only $1k/month).  We live in a ""medium"" cost of living state.   I don't want to retire early but would like to start slowing down substantially by 55.

What are some ideas to continue to super charge savings?  Investment property, switch more to the mega back door roth after I hit the company match on the 401k?

financialindependence,invest $1000,Lots of bullshit at job - Wondering if I'm in a position to quit,"I'm hoping for some advice from the FI community. I strongly dislike my current role and am wondering if I can use some FI leverage I've built to change the situation.

I received a PhD in Physics in 2022. I was hired for my first job soon after and worked at that company for 1.5 years. It was a really great experience. The work was interesting, I had hybrid work, autonomy, and a path to greater responsibility. I could have seen myself spending over 5 years there.

However, my partner and I did not want to live in the location. So I applied to new positions and eventually received an offer for my current role. I started earlier this year.

It's been a definite downgrade. Our engineering team is understaffed. There are restrictive policies I can't go into here that make work life and home life more difficult than they need to be. Work is fully on-site, which isn't the worst thing, but it is a downgrade. It's also a younger, smaller team, which adds to the expectation and social pressure to take on too much, even to one's own detriment. It's a pressure cooker, and people sometimes snap angrily at each other.

**Our net worth is about $500k. We have no kids. It makes me think I just don't need to put up with this.** We've been pursuing FI, and even though we're not there yet, it might be time to pull some of that leverage. I know most people would say to just put up with stuff like this, but the whole point of FI is to challenge common advice like that. And I know for a fact that better situations exist.

**Does this sound like a situation where I suck it up? Or move on? Does our net worth change the calculus on this question?**

------------------------

Summary of stats for partner and I are below. Don't want to give exact numbers, but it's close enough for folks to offer advice.

Ages: Both about 30 years old

Marital status: Engaged

Kids: None. Maybe in 5 years. Not in a rush. Open to adoption.

Assets: $520k ($470k invested)

Debt: $500-1000 on credit cards, paid off in full each month. No mortgage.

Expenses: About $65k per year (rent is about $2k/mo)

financialindependence,invest $1000,Can I retire early without real estate?,"Would like something of a reality check to make sure my goals are realistic. I don't have a hard and fast plan, but I have a goal of retiring in my 40's, the earlier the better. I'm also open to more of a ""downshift"" or taking some time off eventually to just figure out a job that I actually enjoy. I'm currently working as a software dev in NYC, it's a good gig but I'm so done with being tied to a desk from 9-5 and dealing with the complex, never ending minutia of the corporate world. I can probably do this for like 10 more years max. I'm 33, turning 34 in a few months.

Current financial picture:

* 401K: $210,000
* Roth: $54,000
* Taxable Investments: $460,000
* HYSA: $63,000
* HSA: $11,000
* Penson: $8000 (worked at a legacy insurance company for a few years)
* Bank: $14,000
* Crypto: $5000 (all gains, I mined some DOGE in the early days and have been reluctant to sell)

This all brings my total net worth around **$825,000**

My yearly spending based on a past year is about $70,000 and income is \~$200,000. I currently max out my 401k and HSA contributions and contribute $1000/month into my taxable brokerage account along with any extra cash that builds up in my bank account periodically.

I'm still single, uncertain on kids but leaning towards no (frankly can't imagine having to work so much longer due to expense of having kids), I don't own any property and live in Manhattan. It's obviously very expensive here but I have been able to make it work and still save considerably.

Right now I don't really know what retirement would look like or what my expenses would be in retirement but I don't think I'd have to lead some lavish lifestyle. Probably not too far off from how I currently live. Also would depend on who I choose as a partner to spend my life with.

I don't want to leave NYC any time soon but I don't think I'd ever buy property here. Unless I had some crazy windfall or things took a really good turn. My father has told me I will have a sizeable inheritance ($1-2mil likely), but I do not want to count on that. It would be amazing if I could convince him to maybe gift some of that sooner, but I don't think he'd be too happy if I just used that to retire (he has a strong work ethic and doesn't really believe in not working for a living).

If I do move out of NYC I'd probably consider buying property if I can figure out where I want to settle down. I have European citizenship and love the idea of retiring in Portugal but I'm not sure I would actually do that. It's nice to think about though.

The one thing I'm super uncertain about is healthcare, if I were to retire early I have no idea what insurance costs would look like. I'm currently healthy and have no major medical costs, but I realize that may not always be the case.

Anyways, am I realistic in my goals here? Should I be doing anything different? Any advice is appreciated.",32,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1fpf2uu/can_i_retire_early_without_real_estate/,1727297734.0,nyc_finances,1fpf2uu,advice_seeking

Big changes:  
I got married! In the lead up to FIRE I decided I wanted to leave with zero vacation days left. The value of the PTO was nothing compared to making it to the next RSU vesting date and taking the vacation made it much more bearable to make it that far. While on vacation abroad I met my now wife. We dated long distance for awhile where it probably only worked out because I could go visit her for weeks at a time, so I have FIRE to thank for it. We got married last year and are now about 7 weeks pregnant.  
  
I’m sure this will get asked how getting married after firing finances are working for us, so here that goes. We did a prenup (both represented by our own attorneys). Everything before marriage stays separate (including investment growth). Everything earned during marriage is community (though neither of us plans on working so probably not relevant). She will get a lump sum alimony payout in the event of divorce if the marriage lasts over 10 years with an amount we are both comfortable with. We have a joint checking account that all expenses come out of. Waiting on her SSN to come in to be able to start a joint brokerage.  
  
We moved. My 1 bedroom apartment was too small for us and she will be having lots of friends/family visiting so needed to move to a 2 bedroom. In the process also moved closer to my family since she is used to living very close to hers. With the baby on the way, an upgrade to a 3 bedroom apartment/house will likely be coming once our lease is up.  
  
I will need to be getting a new car since my current 2 door coupe is definitely not suited for a baby. Unsure yet if it will be for her to use and we’ll be a 2 car household or if I’ll replace mine. The move luckily included a garage with a 240V plug for EV charging so definitely moving to an EV, likely a new or used Ioniq 5.

financialindependence,small windfall,Small Windfall,"So I just received a retention bonus from work that vested July 1. It’s not big (think $20K). I’m 40 years old and planned to FIRE to Panama around 2030 all else equal.

Even without this I’m on a good track to FIRE around 2030 - at that time I’ll be 45 with about $700K in Tax-Free (Roths, HSA, etc.) accounts that I plan to just let ride and keep doubling until 65 (so >$2M). I have about $46K a year in lifetime income (which adjusts with SS COLA yearly).

Currently work making ~ $165K ($150 + 11% bonus, sometimes more) and I’m single which affords me the ability to MAX every Roth vehicle I can, which I have and will continue until I actually FIRE).

I have a “Bridge Account” of ETF’s and $100k Cash account. The “Bridge Account I plan on turning into a low-medium-ish risk dividend account to supplement my already recurring yearly $46k mentioned above. I continue to invest $6k/month about 75/25 with the ETF & cash account (mostly SGOV in the “cash account”). Between these 2 accounts it should be somewhere close to $500k by the time I need it (2030) - should also point out I plan to move to Panama when I FIRE. I also have real estate in Dallas with close to $100K net worth; I have golden handcuff mortgage rate so still unsure what I’ll do with that (sell it outright or lease it and hire a property manager).

Sorry for the long-winded detail but thanks if you stayed this far - so back to the $20K “windfall” - part of me is tempted to do something I’d  EVER in a million years do and yeet it into different Yieldmax ETFS. I know the NAV will kill me but apparently with those yields you make your investments back fairly quickly. This would not be a long term holding lol.

financialindependence,small windfall,Didn’t hit six figures or win the lottery just made peace with slow progress,"Hey everyone,

I just wanted to share a little reflection for anyone out there who’s feeling behind, especially if you didn’t grow up around financial literacy or “smart money habits.”

I’m 29, no trust fund, no tech salary, no windfalls. I’ve made most of my progress making average money, sometimes below average. I didn’t even start thinking seriously about FI until my mid-20s — before that, money was something I either ignored or feared. I used to think “financial independence” was just code for “you were born lucky.”

But over the last 3–4 years, I’ve shifted that mindset. I started tracking my spending with a notebook and a spreadsheet. Opened a Roth IRA with $100 and bought my first index fund. Paid off my credit card balance and started saying no to lifestyle inflation. Some months I saved $20. Others, I saved $200. It never felt impressive  just consistent.

The turning point for me wasn’t hitting a number. It was realizing that I had changed. I stopped avoiding my bank app. I started making decisions with my future self in mind. And I slowly began to believe that FI isn’t about being perfect it’s about being persistent.

I’m still early in the journey. My net worth is modest. But I have an emergency fund, zero high-interest debt, and a small but growing investment portfolio. I feel calm for the first time in a long while.

If you’re just starting and it feels like you’re crawling that’s okay. I crawled for years. Now I’m walking. Maybe someday I’ll run.

financialindependence,small windfall,"How to help parent in-laws (60 yrs old) with little savings, but want to get started","Looking for advice on how to help in-laws with little savings get started. 

Background: Spouse’s parents are ~60 years old and have little to no money saved for retirement. FIL has his own small business, MIL does not work. They’ve never made a ton of money but do well enough to get by. They have small amount saved up in savings account for emergencies but have never really invested and don’t know much about that space. They also got a small windfall a fews years back and used to buy their first house with ~6% mortgage. 

FIL plans to work as long as he can, as they’re definitely not set up for a traditional retirement. And my spouse and I recognize we will have to help out at some point. But right now they do have some extra money at the end of each month and have asked us how they can best use that (as spouse and I are into FI, investing, ect..)

I generally know rules of thumb for someone younger with traditional job (401k match, HSA, Roth IRA, ect…) but wonder if advice is different for someone in their position?

Initial thoughts:

1) Make sure emergency fund is well funded, then either:

2a) Put extra money each month to additional mortgage payments 

Or

2b) Start investing small amounts (S&P 500 fund / bonds).

If 2b not sure what type of account would be best for them? Roth IRA, solo 401k,ect…?

Any other thoughts on the advice you would give?

financialindependence,what to do with extra money,Laid off for the Fourth and Final time,"Today, at the age of 52, I was laid off for the 4th time in my nearly 30 year career. This will be the last layoff for me, as this marks my unceremonious retirement.

The first time I was laid off was in 1998. I was 26 years old working for a big CPG company that had just merged with another big CPG company and I was made redundant. I was making $27,000 a year ($53,000 in today's dollars) and renting a basement apartment for $465 a month ($920 in today's dollars). I was given 3 months notice and a severance package of $5,000. In that 3 months I lined up another job and took two weeks between gigs to go on a solo camping trip. Getting laid off didn't seem like such a big deal.

The second time I was laid off was in 2008. I was divorced, 36 years old, and owned a house with a mortgage payment. I was given no notice (I had just unloaded my groceries on the belt at the grocery store when the call came in. I abandoned my groceries and walked out in a haze. I still feel bad about that.) The job market in 2008 was much different and I had much bigger expenses. Getting laid off was a big deal this time. I sold my house and moved in with a friend, and managed to land another job thanks to a referral from someone at my old job. I was only unemployed for about 2 months.

That job lasted until 2014 when I was laid off again, 3 weeks after having bought my first ever brand new car. I was renting an apartment at that point but knew if push came to shove I could move back home with my parents, even though at the age of 42 I was hoping I wouldn't need to. 3 months later I landed a new job. (and I drove that brand new car for the next 10 years)

I started my new job at $88,000 in 2015 and two years later got a promotion and a 20% raise that pushed me over the 6-figure salary mark for the first time ever. I remember lying in bed that night and thinking about what it meant for my future. I wasn't thinking of buying a bigger house or a nicer car or going on a European vacation. I was thinking about maxing out my tax advantaged accounts and starting a brokerage account with the extra money. It was at this point where I first learned about FIRE.

I left that job in the labor market frenzy of 2021 and got a fully remote job where even I thought I was being overpaid. I recognized that it would be great while it lasted, but knew that when times got tough my salary would likely stand out and put me at the top of the chopping block. And this year things did get tough. And as expected, I was let go. The HR manager was taken aback by the fact that I was not upset.

I knew it was coming as all of the signs were there so I'd been running the numbers in the weeks beforehand and knew things would be okay. I am in a very fortunate position as I am on my new husband's health insurance, we carry no mortgage or other debt, and have enough savings so that if I choose to never work again, we'll be fine. And after 30-ish years of sitting behind a desk for 8 hours a day, I think I'm done with that. I do think I'll look for employment again, but it will not be anything that includes daily Zoom calls or people saying things like ""let's double click on that later"".

I have been so very lucky at every turn. Every layoff turned into something better. Every layoff reminded me that nothing good lasts forever so save some $ while you can. 

It feels quite anticlimactic to be honest. Maybe it's because it ended with a layoff and not on my own terms, or maybe it's meant to be anticlimactic because it really is about the journey.

In any event, I'm headed out for a bike ride. Then I'll make dinner and play with the dog and get started on re-doing the bedroom which I've been putting off for a while. And I will not stop being grateful for all of the luck I've had or for all of the insight I've gleaned from this community while on the journey that led me here.",1672,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1m7hn9i/laid_off_for_the_fourth_and_final_time/,1753296556.0,betweentourns,1m7hn9i,not_advice_seeking
financialindependence,what to do with extra money,3.5 years post-FIRE - retiring in worst time in past 5 years,"Hi - I wanted to share an update to my story. I think last time I shared some people found it interesting. I'm happy to answer any questions people have.

I left work in Jan 2022 to get the full benefit on a final month of insurance before going on Cobra for 18 months. My insurance from work was insanely good so decided to pay the premium for the full 18 months.

My net worth dropped from $3.4m when I left work to $2.6m within 10 months! Yikes. This was pretty scary for me, but I trusted my gut (and my mental health was poor) that I should just keep carrying on. Worse case this could be a year or two sabbatical / vacation from work and then I could jump back in if I needed to.

And all of that worry eventually went away. Now my net worth 3 years after that drop is $4.2m and I'm spending significantly below my 3% SWR, which in theory should have a 0% chance of going to zero indefinitely.

SWR is now something strange. We discussed this last time, but I think it's worth summarizing my current views on it. Typically you'd take your SWR from your date of retirement and that's your spending rate until you die. You adjust it for inflation each year of course and that should follow the Trinity study among other studies. 

However, if you are going for the more than 30 year timeline like I am and you need the money to last indefinitely, it creates a strange situation where each year or at any given time, you can re-evaluate your situation and pretend that this current date is your retirement date and this is what your SWR rate is. For example, when I left work, it was $104k.  At the bottom it was $78k, right now it's $125k.  So how do I reconcile this in my mind? 

I'm thinking about it like just trying to live my life as comfortable as possible, not necessary spending at the limit either way. In the past years, my spending was lower than even the lowest SWR from my lowest net worth, so I felt comfortable with that.  Now my estimated spending is above that, but significantly below the $125k as if I had retired today, so I still feel pretty comfortable with that given that we're at market highs right now.  We might keep going up, we might crash, but it would be surprising to me if we crashed below 2022. I was just reviewing what would happen if we crashed to 2009 levels and woo boy that would hurt everyone dramatically.  >75% drop?

There's a ton of uncertainty in the future: wars, automation, AI takeover??? Any of these could have dramatic shifts in the market, but I remain indifferent for the most part. I think whatever happens, I'll make it work.  My hope for an optimistic future is that I can be an early adopter of a housemaker robot, maybe the V2 version haha. That seems like it could make my life a bit easier and even if it costs as much as a car, I could fit that into my budget if I consider today's SWR. But even if I take last years, I could think about it as spending that money over 2 years as a one time purchase.

There's so many different ways to view your finances and purchases.

One of the biggest changes I've made is tracking of expenses. I don't track expenses any more at all. I tried this at first and it was extremely time consuming for me since I'm a detail oriented person. Now I just track the withdrawals that I make, which seems like a more necessary and accurate component of the FIRE picture. It's also holistic, encapsulating all spending, no matter what category.

If I need to reduce spending, then I have the records to go back and look at where I can save, but I generally know this already. I spend way too much money on doordash due to mental health issues and not wanting to leave the house. I think that's probably my main expense, my rent is reasonable, car is paid off, dog is sick and costing a lot, but that will end soon when he passes :( 

As far as mental health, it was in the dumpster during the end of my career and most of the time since then. I relocated to see if the grass could be greener and it was for a little while until that wore off. I'm still in the same location, medium cost of living area. I've found out that I have both bipolar 2 and on the high functioning end of the autism spectrum, which has made things make a LOT more sense for me. I've had my ups and downs and currently in the hopeful end of a month long down period. 

I've spent a lot of my free time exploring different hobbies, trying and failing to start a business, exploring the latest AI programming developments to make little fun projects, falling into long periods of depression where I've gained a lot of weight, mostly watched youtube / movies or slept.  I learned that watching youtube videos that are about true crime, especially the ones with police body cam footage is very damaging to my mental health. 

I had one very short relationship in 2022 and due to the depression I haven't really tried since then although I'm starting to get interested again.

I think I'm a pretty good case study of what happens if you leave work in order to escape, without having a plan of what you'll do. It's been rough. Sometimes I'll come look at my accounts and feel relieved when I remember that I am secure financially, although that didn't really work today. 

My latest financial milestone which is fun is that for the first half of this year, I started out with about $20k in my savings account and have been living off of only dividends that get direct deposited into my checking account. No extra withdrawals needed. That's been a pretty good feeling and I hope it continues.

I've rebalanced my investments at the end of the year, staying within the 0% federal tax bracket each year. One thing I've struggled with is figuring out if I should convert my traditional 401k to a traditional IRA and roll that over into Roth IRA or if it's better to do capital gains harvesting where your reset your cost basis by selling a fund, and then re-buying a similar fund.  In down years, you could do both capital loss harvesting and converting to roth, but in the last couple years, there's been no losses for me to harvest.

This past year, I settled on only harvesting gains because I actually needed to do that in order to rebalance my funds in my main taxable account.  It feels good putting some money from mutual funds back into bond funds now after using up some of those bond funds in 2022/23 when the stock market was down ( was selling the least depreciated assets ).

There's some data below and I had a significant amount of cash when I left my job. I tried to have about 6 months worth just in case and I'm glad I did because of the downturn! That cash stretched a lot longer than I initially expected, so that's why the withdrawals were so low that year.

I’m not going to rehash my process up to leaving traditional employment, that is covered in the first post, but to summarize – I took me 10 years of work to reach 500k net worth (NW). Then in the next 6 years I was able to grow to a NW of 2.5M, reaching my targeted 3.3% withdrawal rate to give me 87k (pre-tax) annually to live off of. I then pulled the trigger and left traditional employment in the summer of 2020.

I have the following target investment allocation

* 45% S&P 500 and growth index
* 10% Tech funds (really this has become redundant with the S&P and I’m slowly shifting it over to that)
* 10% International
* 15% Small/Mid cap
* 15% Individual speculation investments
* 5% Bonds (2.5 year “modified bond” tent for surviving a recession)

About 75% of this is in a personal brokerage account, while the rest is a tax advantaged IRA.

The bonds represent a recession-proof source of living money in the event of a market downturn. If my portfolio is down more than 20%, I pull my living from these to avoid harvesting my other investments while they are dramatically down. Then after market recovers, I refill the bonds (as I did last year).

My inflation adjusted budget for FY2024 was 107k. This budget is calculated annually by taking the lesser of my original 87k adjusted for inflation, or 3.3% of my current investable net worth.

**An visual overview of my net worth the last 10 years**

[Link to graph](https://cdn.imgchest.com/files/739cxkjbax7.jpg)

Note: The red dashed line is when I pulled the FIRE trigger. The amount shifting below the zero line represents the amount of FIRE withdrawals that have reduced my net worth. This is necessary to keep my funds categorized this way.

What is wild to me is I’ve withdrawn an excess of 600k, rapidly approaching half of the total money I’ve contributed to my retirement… in only 5 years. Meanwhile, my total net worth has increased by 66% from that point.

**Investment performance**

Once again, I had a pretty solid year for my investments. My investable NW grew 13.2%, slightly outperforming the S&P. Considering some money is tied up in 5% bonds, I’m rather happy with this number.

The small amount of long term speculative investing is still doing well, and is the reason I’ve been able to slightly out pace the S&P over the years. The Cloud Flair I acquired a few years ago has finally blown up. I only had one new speculative add this past year, I picked up some ASML this last winter after their large dip, as I believe it is under valued.

**Inflation and weakening US dollar**

Per the US Bureau of labor statistics, there has been 24.7% inflation since I pulled the FIRE trigger.

Many of my major costs have increased by more than that. My homeowners insurance, car insurance, and health insurance payments continue to grow at an alarming rate.

The decision to buy a house 4.5 years ago was huge (See year 2’s check-in). This wasn’t part of my original FIRE plan, but rapidly increasing rent costs made me pivot. Rental prices have now grown to a level where I would not be able to afford living in my ideal MCOL area anymore.

Inflation still continues to be one of the sources of greatest concern with my FIRE plans. Nothing to be done about it now.

**Budget and actual**

My budget FY2023 was 107k USD.

As discussed in last years check-in, I had a larger purchase that doesn’t fit into the traditional budget. I had planned on exceeding this years budget by about 50%. I bought some rural land for 90k (40k down, the rest financed). In addition, I’ve spent about 40k so far, building out a primitive cabin.

That should have put me largely over budget, but, I managed to pull in about 40k from my app I had developed over the last few years, and I got a one-time small inheritance, just under 60k.

With the extra costs and the extra income, I had a net withdraw of 87k, well below my annual budget.

I normally post a breakdown of my expenses, but with the cabin, it’s a bit of a mess to categorize. Next year I will return to breaking this down. (You can see the prior check-in for a rough idea where my money is going).

For this next year’s budget, I’m taking my original 88k budget and adjusting for inflation: **109k**. It is worth noting this is well less than my current investable net-worth and applying 3.3% = 149k. As said in my recap, my plan is always to take the lesser of the original inflation adjusted budget, or the current invest-able net worth \* 3.3%. For instance, I had to use this new 3.3% base line when the 2022 market dip occurred (see year two check-in post).

While the majority of the cabin costs were included in this fiscal year, I will have some costs that will carry over into next year. This may cause me to exceed my planned budget by \~20%, but given I’ve been under budget the last two years by more than that, this is not a concern.

**Life**

Now being away from traditional employment for 5 years, it feels totally “normal” to me. I’ve had to remind myself this is not normal and try and reflect on how fortunate I am.

For the second half of 2024 I continued to spend a large amount of my free time on niche app development. It resulted in some additional income. This is only a small fraction of what I would have earned at my prior job with that amount of time invested. This app is related to my personal hobbies and I enjoy working on it.

Then starting in 2025, I purchased the rural property and started a full time effort on getting a cabin setup there. I’m basically solo building this, doing it all – design, construction, electrical, plumbing, etc. Being on my feet basically every hour of the day was a bit of an adjustment. This construction has been both enjoyable and a bit frustrating at times. Designing and making something like this scratches the same “itch” that my app development does, I like making things. That said, I will be glad to get the majority of the work done so I can better spend time elsewhere.

I’m not sure what my next major project will be, I’m close to wrapping up the work to get this property/cabin livable, I plan to take 6 weeks off from my self imposed projects, travel and reflect on what to do next.

Even with these time consuming projects, I was still able to interject a lot of activities when it was ideal to do them. Things like biking, climbing, hiking, fishing, skiing, etc. As a result, I continue to be in great physical and mental shape with minimal effort. I almost never have any downtime as I’m always putting a lot of hours in to projects or taking a quick break for some sports activity. There is no reason I need to go so hard. I’m SLOWLY getting better at dialing things back a bit. I’ve learned that I will always git way too invested in personal projects, and it’s something I will strive to continue to better balance.

As stated in prior check-ins, making newer friends continues to be a struggle. People I would meet mid-week while doing some sporting activity they mostly are either on vacation, are quite a bit older, or are burnouts with not much drive. Nice enough people for simple conversations, but its hard finding people you can develop deeper connections with. Having my existing friend group that is still in the workforce continues to be key. I had started to go to meet-ups and things of that nature when I first pulled the trigger. But over the last few years I stopped doing those sort of things, mostly relying on hobbies to meet people. As I largely do solo activities, that hasn’t been conducive to making new friends. This next year, I plan to try and do better at putting myself out there to meet new people.

**Wrap-up**

5 years down. While the path has been unpredictable, everything is falling within the greater FIRE plan. I certainly feel more comfortable than I did after the 26% drop in NW I had in my second year. My net worth is as high as it has ever been.

I hope this was helpful or interesting for some of you. Feel free to ask me any questions and I´ll do my best to respond for the next few days. After that, I won´t log on to this account until another check-in next year.

**My Background** 

I’m a social scientist in my late 40’s who converted a love of computers and data along with my passion for research and predicting the future into a job in tech. I accidentally became a data scientist before that job title really existed. Fun times.  I worked for both large and small companies, both as an FTE and a private consultant. In between jobs in the Fall of 2013 I fell deep into the Bitcoin rabbit hole. I bought on and off for a few years (best price: $220, highest price: $965.) I sold a majority of my holdings in December 2017 when it hit $15k (and the BCH fork hit $3500) for about 1.5M. I had also saved a ton of money over the years (almost 1M) because I lived frugally. My job was no longer very interesting so I quit to take a 1 yr sabbatical/test run and never looked back. I also sold my house three years ago for a large profit. I have a partner who is not exactly FI/RE, and no kids.

**My FIRE Details**

With all my retirement, bank, and stock accounts bundled together, including house equity I had 4M when I pulled the trigger. Since retirement 7 years ago my entire portfolio has more than tripled to 12M at the peak (December 2024). It hasn’t been a linear journey though, it dropped from 9M at one point to just below 5M (December 2022) but is now 11.3M. I outright own my house and truck. I have no debts. 
My portfolio consists of index funds (surprise!) and a few tech stocks I invested $10k each in several years ago as “YOLO” plays (AAPL, GOOG, AMZN, TSLA) as well as my remaining Bitcoin not sold in 2017. My retirement funds are at 515k, so a majority of my wealth is outside of the IRAs. My lifestyle is currently funded by two sources: a deferred salary from my old job (finishes payouts this year) and dividends from my index funds. So far I have rarely needed to cash out stocks for income but that might change due to deferred salary payouts ending. 
I spent $80k last year. Insurances and Taxes account for a lot of that spending ($27k), $15k to my niece’s education fund, $12k on house improvements (including building a sauna), $4k for utilities. I look at my portfolio once a month when I do my net worth tracking (custom Excel spreadsheet). Otherwise, I don’t pay much attention to it all. 


My net worth swings wildly. See the post (referenced above) on the first time I lost a million dollars in a month… because it’s actually happened 4 times. I also gained over 1M a month 4x in the last several years. My average monthly change in net worth since retiring is $93,500 (which is stupid and insane.) The standard deviation of that monthly change gives you an idea of the volatility… $513,000. Sounds like a rollercoaster, doesn’t it? It is – but I got used to it, especially because over the long haul the amount has, if you cross your eyes a little, steadily increased. If I really couldn’t take it I’d just shove everything into tax-free municipal bonds or something. 

**Big Changes**

In the last year my major changes were around organizing my finances. No big trips, some house fixing (mostly me doing the work), and no major surprises or large outlays for unusual situations. 
I had a fundamental shift in how I thought about my wealth. As I moved past the 10M net worth waypost, it struck me that I was at a place where I could suffer a huge pullback and still be able to do whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted. I also realized it was not very useful to hold onto all of my wealth until I died if I was planning on giving it to family anyway. In other words, it seemed absurd to hang on to all of it only to give it to my siblings as inheritance if I lived to be, say, 85 years old and they were also in their 80’s… sure they could hand it down to their families or charities etc. but it makes more sense to me to allow them to have the opportunity to use some of that capital sooner. I also feel like I can and should give money to charity. I feel safe enough to do so without worry. I grew up without much, so the idea of fearlessly giving away my money took a while to manifest. I wasn’t comfortable with the idea until last year. So now I have a goal – I want to give at least 1M to charity. I want to do the same for my siblings sooner vs. later, but I don’t quite know how I’ll do that yet. My siblings are awesome people, and they would never expect me to give them money, nor would they ever feel like they “deserved” my money. None of those “never tell your family you have money or they will come after it” horror stories apply to my family, and I am very grateful for that. I gave them each a generous surprise cash gift last year (not represented in my statement of spending above) and I will probably do the same this year, and possibly into the future depending on how volatile the markets (traditional and bitcoin) get. 

I started a Donor Advised Fund (DAF) and funded it by donating my TSLA stock (because fuck Elon) that was worth around $70k (not bad for a $10k investment 12(?) years ago that I also took $50k from a few years back…) The DAF allows me to donate however much I want to whomever I want (501c3) while also being invested in the market. I have made 4 smaller donations ($500-$1500)so far and it’s really cool to be able to support my community this way. I also got a tax write-off for a portion of it and was not on the hook for any cap gains at all. Wins all around, and 7% of my 1M-to-charity goal funded! 


I moved some money into a Direct Indexing account in order to take advantage of loss harvesting (and I think the timing was right based on what we have seen in the markets over the last month). I feel like I am tuning up my financial position now that I understand it better and have some plans about wealth preservation and sharing. 


I switched my will to a revocable trust, because I needed to update it anyway and it made sense with what I currently own to keep as much out of probate as possible if I were to die so that everyone gets paid out with no bullshit. I also got my powers of attorney set up and all that other fun health directive stuff. I feel very adult at this point. 

**New Ideas/Directions** 

I feel like I am in a good rhythm. I want to do one decent trip a year (3 weeks?), focus on my various forms of art, my community, learning, and improving my house and neighborhood. I have pondered living somewhere else for a full season (Maine? NYC? Berlin?) at some point,  perhaps by house swapping with someone. I’m mostly content where I am (physically, mentally, etc.) There is really nothing material that I am interesting in acquiring outside of some tools (for art), books, etc. – basically nothing particularly expensive or exotic. No vacation houses (too much work!) No fancy cars (I rarely drive anyway.) None of that nonsense is useful to me at this point. As an example, I think my clothing outlay last year was around $200. It has nothing to do with “not wanting to spend money” – if you took me to a clothing store and said “take whatever you want!” I would look for the blue jeans and pick up 10 pairs of the exact same color and then I’d get 30 black t-shirts and call it a day. For real.  

**Challenges**

If you review my previous posts you’ll see that my one stubborn challenge has always my weight – not that I am particularly big (I’m not) but that extra 15 lbs man… it’s still real, it’s still here (and it’s still only 15 lbs – honest!) and I’m not quite ready to say “you know, this is just who you are and this will not change” – I have some strategies in mind so I’ll leave it there. But there’s actually something bigger, something beyond that old complaint. 

In the last couple years I am actually starting to feel older. I am recognizing I will never be as fast as I once was. There are small things I can no longer do (or would need a lot of training to get back to where I could) like jumping off of a huge rock without repercussions.  I have always been really healthy, rarely sick, reasonably strong and limber (without trying) and I see it and moreover *I feel it* now that I am aging that I am not the man I once was. It’s in there…slowing me down slightly but noticeably, and it’s weird. The challenge is twofold – recognizing the truth, and being okay with the body that I inhabit. I can still do all the things I want to, but my knees are creaky when I wake up, and sometimes my back hurts a little for no good reason. Boo fucking hoo, right? But it’s real, and I’d be lying if I acted like it didn’t matter. The last year has really been a study in what is vs. what was.

**Closing**

Like I mentioned last year, I’m at this point where I’m enjoying a sincerely low-key existence. I’m that guy who hangs out in his garage, tinkering on things, fixing stuff that most people would throw away, making weird art to stick around the neighborhood. There’s a local bar that I visit every week or two, and they know me there. They know my name, my drink, my habits. I’ve never had that kind of connection before, and it feels good. It feels right. It feels real. I still love to travel, both with my partner and by myself. I have my shop, my gardens, friends, things to pursue and learn. One of my favorite things to do is wake up when I wake up, make coffee, and sit in the living room or on the front porch, reading news and doing word puzzles. That’s my preferred pace. Moreover – that’s what FI/RE has allowed me to do – my own thing in my own time (nods to Fonda/Hopper). 
Also – I’ve been out of the game so long I can’t even imagine rejoining it. Yes, of course I could, but it feels like a different lifetime ago, or something I read about.
 
I wish the best for you all. If the economy crashes in the near term, I hope that through the smoke you can keep your eyes on the prize.

I’m happy to answer any (reasonable) questions. Good luck everyone!",364,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1ja6sjl/fire_7_years_in_yearly_update_and_whathaveyous/,1741852119.0,FIRE_and_forget_it,1ja6sjl,not_advice_seeking
financialindependence,what to do with extra money,BigTech to Education 1 Year Mark; CoastFIRE as a High School Teacher,"I've posted about this a couple of times, and nearly every time I do I get a flurry of PMs asking for specifics, so I figured I'd make a larger post to celebrate my 1 year mark this month!

In July 2024, I left my remote FinTech job as a Senior Product Manager where my previous year total comp was just shy of 250k. I live in a MCOL city in the South, and have been aggressively saving since finishing undergrad in 2014, so I had a bit over 650k invested and plenty of cushion. Ultimately, like many of you, I hated the corporate grind and hated the software industry. I had tried different companies of different sizes, including a handful of Fortune 500s, two startups that got acquired, and an agency. In one last shot in the dark, I left an 80k person firm in Jan '24 to join a 500 person one, and still just _hated_ my day to day.

For the previous five years (so glad I found it pre-Covid), I had been volunteering in a non-profit that did financial and business focused education for middle and high school students. Basically they embed certain competencies and skills in a standard curriculum and lean heavily into project based learning for building presentation skills that ultimately leads to big events judged by local businesses. Think something like a science fair for teenaged entrepreneurs and consultants. Being on the judge/coach side of things was some of the most fulfilling work of my life; so much so that when I told my BigTech boss how much I was feeling burnt out in early 2023, he encouraged me to double my Volunteer hour budget, so I did.

Unfortunately for that same boss, I fell further in love with the program, and with working with kids. In late 2023 I decided to dip my toes into a possible transition and interviewed both at that non-profit, and shadowed a few teachers across a couple different schools to get a feel for what it would look like.

Thinking I could only teach Computer Science, since that's what I _did_ for ten years, I called in a favor and shadowed the AP-CSP teacher at the best school in my state, and decided I _could_ do it, but that I was already _leaving_ CS, and would rather be doing something more _human_. I never liked programming, and thought the people that got into it for a passion were weird at best and massively unempathetic at worst. I did my undergrad in history and sociology, and had some background there, and through a series of very lucky bump ins and connections, I found an opening at a school I had volunteered in that needed an AP Government teacher that was embedded in the business curriculum.

So now, that's what I do. I'm currently in pre-planning and my course load is leadership, AP Gov, and US History. My salary last year was $59k. If my wife didn't work, we'd _barely_  cover our spend if we made some tolerable cuts. We currently burn 60-70k/yr depending on travel, and could make some cuts if needed.

As for certification, my state allows for a provisional teaching license if you do a quickie online course and pass a subject test, but requires additional schooling to be permanently certified. As such, I've enrolled in a Masters program that'll be wrapped up in May after burning _very hot_ for Spring and Summer semesters_. I often quote the pilot episode of _Burn Notice_ ""I haven't worked this hard for this little money in a long time.""

Long story short, I love my job, it's somehow more all-consuming that my last job at 1/4 the salary, and yet I love the day to day. We're in a position that once the graduate degree is finished, we could conceivably live on just my now boosted salary if my wife wanted to ease off the gas herself. I'm happy to answer any questions but may be vague in some areas to limit doxxing, although I've probably already given away a lot of details.

On the finance side, I've gained about 100k from last year, and that's after spending 13k in tuition and another grand or so in other certs and random paperwork the state has thrown my way. I'm a little less liquid (at least in brokerage), and spent a fair bit of effort moving from a cash heavy position (knowing a career change was coming) to heavily funneling money into my tax advantaged 457b. For those unaware, a 457b allows for penalty free draw downs upon separation _at any age_, so it's like a 401k that'll work in my early 40s without any extra steps. I still invest 15% of my meager salary and will continue to do so unless we have significant need for that cash.

TLDR: Quit Big Tech, became a public school social studies teacher, love working with kids and being poor",157,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1mccfl9/bigtech_to_education_1_year_mark_coastfire_as_a/,1753798136.0,govt_surveillance,1mccfl9,not_advice_seeking
financialindependence,what to do with extra money,A Holistic Framework for Deciding When to Retire,"On this board the decision to retire is often framed as a question of hitting a certain number based on a “Safe Withdrawal Rate”. This is often for the purpose of making projections and so on, but still a lot of mental energy is spent discussing this or that number, or estimating one’s progress toward it, etc. What follows is a more holistic way of approaching early retirement, considering your withdrawal rate along with certain additional factors that could trigger retirement even if you have not hit 25X or 30X spending. Basically, as you approach a true Safe Withdrawal Rate, you can start to balance the risk of running out of money based on current spending versus other factors

  
**First, determine your financial independence baseline.** 

Financial independence is more of a continuum than an on/off switch. The more multiples of your expenses you have saved, the less risky your retirement. Depending on how much you have saved, you will need more factors on the side of retiring now. 

If you have achieved 20X expenses, you can retire with some risk. With average returns you will be fine, but with a market crash early in retirement there is a chance you could be forced to go back to work or dramatically reduce your lifestyle. You should have *multiple additional factors* on the side of retirement.

If you have achieved 25X expenses, you can retire with minimal (but some) risk. With extremely bad returns there is a chance you could be forced to go back to work or dramatically reduce your lifestyle. Still, retiring is probably the right decision, especially if you have *at least one additional factor* on the side of retirement. 

At 30X expenses or higher, you are basically safe to retire immediately, regardless of additional factors. 

**Second, consider additional factors for/against retirement.** Again, the more you have saved, the fewer of these you need. 

* *Is your budget flexible?* If your budget includes a lot of discretionary spending, you can easily cut expenses and lower your withdrawal rate should you encounter a poor sequence of returns. In actuality you have already achieved a Safe Withdrawal Rate, you are simply choosing to spend more.
* *Do you really, really hate your job?* If your job is having a noticeable effect on your physical or mental health, retirement could be worth the risk. Even though you would be taking some financial risk with an aggressive retirement, you would certainly be making yourself miserable while also risking your physical and mental health. 
* *Do you have a biological reason to retire now?* Perhaps your retirement dream involves physical things that you won’t be able to do at a more advanced age. Perhaps you have kids and don’t want to waste their childhood at your job. Perhaps you have a chronic illness or you have always wanted to retire by XX age for whatever reason. Aggressive reitrement may be worth the risk if there is a biological reason to retire now. 
* *Do you have the ability to earn income in retirement?* This could be through freelance work in your professional field, or something completely different like working in a coffee shop. Either way, a small amount of extra income could reduce stress on your portfolio in a poor sequence of returns scenario. As long as you are able and willing to work at least part time in retirement, you could run the risk of an aggressive retirement. 
* *Is the market at low valuations?* Perhaps you have your recently surpassed your FI number only to have the market crash. If you are close to your FI number in a low valuation market, you can theoretically retire with approximately the same confidence as someone at their FI number in a high valuation market. 

You can probably think of other “additional factors”. The point is, the decision to retire is not like an on/off switch determined purely by a mathematical calculation. There are other factors to consider. This is a general framework for considering them.

How'd I get here?

1. I wouldn't be here without the **luck and privilege** of the country I was born into, my parents, my health, and this community. I come from a frugal, stable, middle-class home that valued education. I received significant merit scholarships and parental support and worked 3 part-time jobs to graduate college debt-free ([\+$10k NW at the time of graduation](https://i.imgur.com/kFiSuth.png)). I graduated before the pandemic occurred and stayed employed throughout.
2. I **found FIRE early and invested heavily**. Since my first job, I've been [maxing out every tax-advantaged account](https://i.imgur.com/XBzmvXG.png) available to me, throwing any extra into my brokerage. I avoided significant lifestyle creep for 5 years, [maintaining an average 70% savings rate my entire career](https://i.imgur.com/l6xBH6K.png), and today I find myself maxing my HSA, IRA, 401(k), ESPP, and MBDR, enabling me to set aside $79,800/yr before I even think about spending. I don't invest in crypto, options, or individual stocks; I just keep it simple with low-cost total stock market index funds.
3. [I left jobs](https://i.imgur.com/X9h5ors.png) when I felt comfortable (stagnant) and **realized my value was higher elsewhere**. My first job in 2019 paid $75K in supply chain consulting, and after 2 years of little to no raises/bonuses, I switched companies in 2022 for a senior consultant job making $135K with a $12K signing. After another few years of limited raises/bonuses, I jumped last year for a manager consulting role at my current company, where I was offered $190K base and $38K signing. I also made $24K off of referral bonuses last year, but that gravy train ended so I expect to make less this year.
4. **I have a partner who is on board**. I rent an apartment with him in a MCOL city, and though we keep our finances separate, he lets me use his car (so I don't own one), we split rent, and I cover the rest of our joint expenses. His income will represent \~25% of our combined base salaries, we have a prenup, and he has some student loans that we'll be knocking out together. He's frugal, hardworking, trustworthy, reminds me to relax and take care of my mental and physical health, is an amazing cook, sees kids/travel/FIRE as priorities, and adds value to my life in ways that remind me true wealth isn't measured in dollars.

The biggest mental shift in this time has been my attitude towards spending. I used to feel a lot of guilt spending money on myself. [I even differentiated necessary vs discretionary spending](https://i.imgur.com/ilIBdMf.png). I used to justify this by saying it was so that I'd know what I could cut if I lost my job, but really, I was trying to shame myself. I was overly frugal when I started, making my life smaller in the pursuit of a high savings rate. [This year I have a personal trainer, house cleaner, and three international trips](https://i.imgur.com/LEtfc0p.png). I'm buying better groceries, higher quality clothing, saying yes to restaurants and adventures with friends... The marginal utility of increasing spending by a few thousand is way more than the marginal value of increasing saving. It took me a while to accept that.

So, what's next? For the first time in a long time, I don't know, which is strange and beautiful. In the short term, we want to have a fun wedding, enjoy our honeymoon in Japan, buy a new car, and pay off his student loans. In the medium term, we want to travel the world, have kids, and buy a house. In the long term, we want to retire early and perhaps start a financial literacy non-profit together.

Throughout that journey, I imagine my career and priorities will change. I might not save or track as much as I do now, and I'm grateful to my younger self for her discipline and ambition to give me that kind of flexibility. At this point, [my SWR is $25k/yr](https://i.imgur.com/jOAwWuq.png). I could [coast and hit my original FIRE number](https://i.imgur.com/dUyAMdO.png) \-- $2mm -- at 43. Or if I continue current savings rates, I'm [projected to hit $2mm in 2031](https://i.imgur.com/3UDjy0K.png). Maybe that accelerates with his income, maybe that decelerates with our future kids.

To you guys, thanks for being a home for me to share successes and failures, spreadsheets and sankeys. I've been grateful to learn from and contribute to this community, and you'll probably see more of me in the daily as I learn to navigate joint finances, update our W-4s, change health insurance, etc. Until next time!",209,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1m0i6zk/graphs_and_sankeys_of_a_spreadsheet_nerd_70_avg/,1752587146.0,BloomingFinances,1m0i6zk,not_advice_seeking
financialindependence,what to do with extra money,$1.2 million NW as a 35 old using debt without a super high paying salary. Canada ,"
*$ are in CAD


Decided to post my FI journey, which is seen by most on Reddit as risky, unconventional and labeled as a “ticking time bomb”. This has not been the case for me at all and has jump started my journey to where I can coast for the next 10 years.  My strategy consists of using low interest debt (HELOCs, Portfolio Margin, Balance Transfer Credit Cards) to front loading my investments and redirect my cash to paying down the loans

 

In the last 10 years, I’ve accumulated $2.4 mil in assets and $1.2 mil in liabilities and passed the $1.2 mil net worth this month. I take out loans, repay them depending on if they are tax deductible, terms and the overall rate.  My rationale is I would rather have the $10,000 today and pay ~$385 bi-weekly for a year than try and save up for that $10,000. My $10k growth will far exceed the interest I pay. The amount of interest I ended up paying is very little and psychologically it helps to have automatic transfers every pay period.

 

I am at the point now where I can buy $50,000 of a stock without using any of my own money, hold it for a few months…make $8,000 - $15,000 and use those funds to buy more, or use the funds for other uses. The amount of interest I pay is minimal and is tax deductible. Alternatively, if I don’t want to sell, collect the dividend and continue to let it grow and compound.  If I do sell it at a loss, I can write off the loss. No home run stocks or crypto, just buying mostly Canadian dividend stocks that are reinvested and few growth stocks. Biggest win was Suncor at $50k profit after Covid.  Biggest loss was AQN currently at -$35k (haven’t sold yet). I keep LOCs and other assets on the sides in case I do need cash ASAP during market blips.

 

For those who aren’t familiar with the time value of money, life cycle investing, The Smith Maneuver and using other people’s money (OPM), I recommend reading up on them and making the determination if this strategy is for you or not.

Rather not discus my role/industry but it’s a non STEM position, I have a regular Bachleor’s degree.

 

Key for me was to always have roommates and look for ways to make extra money. Turned my first property into a rental and did what I could to monetize it further (charging extra for parking, storage…etc). Leverage as much as I could from all my assets to continue to buy more. I’ve survived margin calls, salary reductions, collapse of oil, Covid downturn and a few other challenges into my journey. Currently making about $1500 - $2000 / month on a side business flipping items online, doing gig work, credit card churning and related stuff.  

 

Goal for me now is to continue to build up my stock portfolio and bring down my non-tax-deductible debt down further. I’ve debated buying another rental but I personally like this more than real estate as transactional costs are cheaper and not have to deal with tenants / tenancy laws.

 

Plan is to pull the plug at 45 yrs old and live off my dividends.

 

To all the haters to say don’t take debt…I could care less. I’m a millionaire and the compounding is incredible at this level. My month-to-month growth can often exceed my salary.  Not all debt is bad debt.

financialindependence,what to do with extra money,Three year RE update,"I gave notice three years ago at 54 yrs old, then worked part time for a few weeks before wiping the slate clean and starting my retirement. Not “young” by any means, but still way ahead of of the majority of Americans. I thought I’d give my thoughts and experiences in case it’s helpful to others.  

BACKGROUND 

I got to FI by unmarried, but have a partner (44), no kids. Our basic expenses are split 50/50, with me picking up extras/luxuries while SO continues to work. We rent in a HCOL area. 

I built my wealth the old school way, working since the age of 9 (paper route), part-time work through my teenage years and college, and supporting myself entirely from age 21. I received a small inheritance that paid off my student loan debt at the age of 40 (total college debt including interest $81k) and got me on my investing path. I know that’s very late compared to some. 

I quit my corporate career 3 years ago. Most of my previous jobs provided low to modest income until about the last 15 years when I got lobbed into the C-suite on a stroke of luck. As my income went up I continued to to LBYM since I was good at being frugal from necessity. This allowed me to boost my savings rate and invest aggressively when the money finally started rolling in. My ability to RE is much more a function of high savings than compound interest, though the last decade has been sweet in that regard. 

I have lived in HCOL cities since college, and never owned real estate except for one short term rental that I got out of due to the world’s worst tenant and no patience for land lording out of state. Generally speaking my own rent has been stabilized and either had a roommate or lived with a partner. I drove used cars all the way until I bought a new car with a bonus before I quit my last job just to see what it felt like (it was fun ok, but I’ll never do it again since the depreciation is ridiculous). 

MONEY

I retired with 33x expenses and have now lived off the portfolio for 2 years. AA was shifted from 70/30 to 60/40 about two years before I pulled the trigger. Maybe it’s too conservative, but at my age I just didn’t feel like taking the risk since I don’t think I’ll have another shot of reaching FI. The first year’s expenses were covered by some unpaid vacation and a chunk of cash set aside to get me through. I initially thought I was taking a year off and would return to some work, but other than a little very part time gig work I haven’t. 

Shifting from saving to spending was a little nerve wracking the first year, but I got used to it as my portfolio has actually gone up thanks to the market. I’ve run the numbers enough now to feel secure, barring a black swan event in which case we’ll all be in the same boat anyway. If anything I am probably underspending and have been thinking a lot about Die With Zero to help with that. 

PSYCHOLOGY

This has been by far the more difficult issue than the money. I was raised to always bring in a paycheck and I worked hard and had my identity tied up in being a productive member of society. I had planned to give notice right before the pandemic, but stayed on for the extra cash until the world reopened. By the time that moment came I was really burned out from all the zoom meetings, hitting my 50s, and just being over the corporate nonsense generally. I do not regret leaving my job at all, but the drop in social life and structure has definitely been something to navigate, particularly because my partner is still working. 

It took me well over a year just to detox from a life of full-time work, which I now see as a kind of addiction. Although I thought I was working in an area I enjoyed at times, I can now see that I was mostly just doing what I was “supposed to do” as your average American male. It wasn’t all bad, but I have felt sorry to see that my drive, ambition and choices were mostly built around the American dream instead of following my heart. Partly that’s because I don’t think I even knew what that meant outside of “becoming successful.” Detaching from all the unconscious scripts I was running in my head took more time than the stress detox, and I’m only now starting to feel like I’m coming around to understand who I am without a career. Hopefully it’s not too late!

WHAT I DO ALL DAY

Everyone says “retire TO something.” I have done a lot of searching for ideas on this point. Examples I’ve found to a large degree are people committed to their children and grandchildren, and lots of work around the house--none of which occupy my life. If I sound like I’m complaining, that’s not my point. It’s more a matter of not having a lot of role models or examples of people who’ve escaped the rat race and found a solution in the void of a childless life. Kids just seem to created automatic meaning and purpose for many out there. I have come across some wealthy people who seem to have found their way into meaningful enterprise, but they also came from money to begin with so were, perhaps, better equipped to wrestle with the question from the start. 

So what have I done? A ton of travel (awesome, half of which with my partner), daily exercise (takes more discipline without a job pushing against my time, but I get it done), lots of reading. I’ve taken a number of classes as a way to experiment with new possibilities, and have studied a foreign language for all three years (including practicing it on the ground as part of my travels). If you’re familiar with Riley Moynes “four stages of retirement” I’d say I’m coming around to Stage 3, which involves a lot of experimentation. I’m grateful for the time and resources to do this, but coming from the point of view of “being productive,” this takes a lot of patience since the failure rate so far has been pretty high. Travel, btw, is an expensive way to work through boredom, so I’ve had to be a little more strategic with the way I’ve been spending that non-essential bucket.

Socially things have been the most challenging since my partner works, along with every single one of my friends. While I’m a bit on the “old” side, I’m still the “youngest” retiree in my social group. That means a lot of time alone to cook, meditate, and ponder the virtues of retirement. Being in a HCOL city, I also don’t find many retirees hanging around, since people are generally here to work and pay their expensive rent. I’ve tried a couple meetups but they are very hit & miss given the size of the city. I’ve more so been working on keeping in close touch with the friends I already have, but that also requires patience since they are getting kids ready for college and navigating financial burdens, divorce, etc. 

TL;DR

For an ambitious life long worker, early retirement has been a blessing and a challenge. The money question has been easier than the purpose question. The hardest has been navigating the social changes since I don’t really know any other early retirees. I wouldn’t change my lot, however, and am grateful for what I’ve achieved. More time experimenting seems to be in my future, and I look forward to my partner joining me on the couch eventually ;). ",334,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1ghkc8g/three_year_re_update/,1730507489.0,wolvesbelonginak,1ghkc8g,not_advice_seeking
financialindependence,what to do with extra money,Shifting mindsets,"41M and 39F, had been planning on RE at end of the year, but laid off on Friday. My wife already didn't work and I've decided to take the plunge. We have spent so much of our lives in saving mode and I'm trying to shift our mindset to actually enjoy what we've accumulated. How do you do it?

I've posted my numbers before and I feel confident in my decision. Not going to deep dive into it on this post because I have before, but total investments as of yesterday is 1.59M. This does not include a paid off house and paid off cars. Our house is new and construction was just completed in Dec 2023, so repairs unlikely in the near future.

Looking at ERN's data, a 3.25% WR has a 0% failure for 50 years- that's the number we're going with. I know that something catastrophic could happen but I 0% is as low as I can get.

Including healthcare at full cost this year (going to harvest as many LTCG as I can this year), our budget is 40K, and that already has some fun spending in it. I know it's a lean FIRE but we are comfortable with that. We are homebodies that enjoy doing a lot of things that cost little or no money.

3.25% of 1.59M is 51K. I had originally wanted to stick to our budget so our investments grow that much bigger, but I feel like that extra 11k is just going to waste since statistically the fail rate is 0% .

My wife and I are on the same page regarding spending. I was explaining all this to my wife and suggested we could spend 1k on a vacation. She said she can't even imagine spending that on a vacation. How do I shift from this mindset and allow us to enjoy what we've built?",47,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1i1gshr/shifting_mindsets/,1736889634.0,Widget248953,1i1gshr,advice_seeking
financialindependence,bonus invest,-48k to 1M Net Worth in 9 Years,"1m Networth Update

About eight years ago, I made my first post on Reddit in the personal finance sub, sharing how I took a year off from my social life to work 90 hours a week, and pay off my student loans in just one year. A lot of people doubted me, some even called me a ""plant"" trying to sell something (though I have no idea what). But one kind person suggested I check out this sub, saying, ""I was ready for it""—and I got hooked. I read all the recommended books, started maxing out my retirement accounts, lived frugally (but not miserably), picked up side hustles, optimized credit card points, and, for the most part, just bought VTSAX.

My goal for 2025 was to hit 1m but got a shock today. I track everything in Wealthfront, noticed I hadnt updated my wife's retirement accounts on there in a long time. When I renewed the link it shockingly had 60k more than I thought (triple checked fidelity to make sure it was real) and soared past 1m.

Age 37 wife 35.

2025 115k income with 5k performance bonus, side hustle Uber for a few k, do credit card and bank acct bonuses for prob 2k a year, wife 130kish but has taken off time last few years for our 3kids.

-$314k Equity in House (Yes, I get I can't spend my house and still have way to go to hit FIRE # but still pumped to hit this milestone).

-$25k cash and high yield savings (need to buy car soon tho, holla if you have used Camry)

-$47k in after tax investment accounts

-$4,450 in treasury bonds

Have money in kids college funds but dont count towards nw

Basic strategy of maxing out retirement accounts and also investing 1k monthly in after tax, VTSAX & Chill.

Again, if you missed it above, I know I can't spend my house but still pumped to hit this milestone, especially since I feel I've been in the boring middle for a while. Also, none of my friends are into fire and are more into ""Keeping up with the Joneses."" 

Also, I'll share one susstinct memory. During the year I took off from my social life, one of my best friend's bachelor parties was in Nashville. I was putting every nickel I had at my loans and couldn't justify staying at the expensive hotel they were, so I opted to stay at a hostel. One friend, that's not good at ball busting (always just comes off mean, not funny), kept calling me poor and cheap during the trip. I ended up having to pay for the axe throwing for 12 people when the best man ""didn't have his wallet on him"" that organized the activity (could have stayed at the hotel in a solo room for that). But now 9 years later, that ""poor guy"" is a millionaire baby....a mili, a mili, a mili.

I had previously built my emergency fund up to 12 months’ expenses ($50k); however, when my bonus hit this year during market turmoil, I didn’t invest it. Now, a few months later, I’m switching roles and thinking of further increasing my emergency fund ($75k) up

While I can attribute my career and financial progression to hard work, opportune timing, luck, and risk tolerance, I'd be remiss to not mention how privileged I was to have a supportive family that instilled strong financial habits and educational values and their generosity helped me avoid undergraduate student loans.

I then went to law school, and because of key scholarships, only graduated with \~$120,000 in student loans.

I knew my 2L summer job would not lead to an offer. After a massive job hunt (\~500 applications, 25 coffee meetings) I landed a non-partner track attorney role in BigLaw. While associates made more than double (165K) my salary (65K), I needed a job and I figured it could lead to an opportunity. A couple years later, the opportunity struck and I joined a handful of departing partners to lateral to another firm, which lead to a large promotion and salary increase from 2015 to 2016. 

Five years later, I made another move and left BigLaw to start my own practice. Giving up BigLaw was tough: golden handcuffs, security of a salary and benefits, partner track, over $80,000 in bonus money t left on the table. Instead, I had to generate my own work, and only took home a % of what I worked on. I also had no assurance work would come with me and I knew I'd have at least 6 months of little to no income.

The gamble paid off. I now work fewer hours than BigLaw (600-900 billable hrs per year vs. 2000-2200) and make more money. But there are tradeoffs, especially since no income is guaranteed. No benefits. No major firm resources. I focus much more time on business development. We also have had a good economy and things can change quickly--whether its macroeconomic (recession, mass layoffs) or client changes.

For those keeping score, in 2015 and in 2022, I received $40,000 and $100,000 via inheritances, both went towards paying down student loans (2015) or my taxable brokerage account (2022).

**Assets**

* Taxable brokerage: $975,000
* Previous employer 401K (mix of both traditional and Roth): $445,000
* Solo 401k (mix of both traditional and Roth): $257,000
* Roth IRA: $117,000
* HSA: $59,000
* Checking/Savings/Business Checking: $65,000
* Crypto: $10,000

My investments are a mix of traditional (23%), Roth (24%), and taxable (53%). I'd like to have a healthy mix of all three for maximum flexibility.

**Debts**

Minimal debts aside from monthly credit card spend (paid in full) and an auto loan (6K) at 0% APR.

**Property**

I may buy property (primary, investment, or both) in the next 2-5 years. Since property is a nice-to-have (but not necessary), I place my down payment savings in my taxable brokerage for maximum growth. If the market explodes (like it has since I've been seriously investing) I can afford the house sooner. If it tanks, I'll just rent.

**Financial Strategies**

* r/churning for credit card bonuses
* Frugal living from 2013-2015 to prioritize getting out of debt (e.g., roommate, renting my apartment on Airbnb, cooking, limiting restaurant/bar spend)
* Roommates and a rent controlled apartment from 2013-2020. Most of my contemporaries were paying 2-3X my rent.
* Maxed IRA from 2015-present (via backdoor Roth)
* Maxed 401k employee contribution from 2016-present
* Maxed 401k after tax and/or employer contribution from 2018-present (via mega backdoor Roth)
* Maxed HSA contribution from 2017-present. I am paying out of pocket for medical expenses and saving receipts for future tax free withdrawals in 20-30 years.
* While I was a W2 employee, I set-up automatic investments to my taxable brokerage twice a month (following payday) staring at $500 and increasing each month until I felt the pain in my budget. In truth, I barely noticed the slight increases (especially with my salary increases and general frugal approach) which eventually led to $2,000 automatic investment every two weeks for a number of years.
* Since I incorporated my business and I now leverage various tax strategies (business expenses, PTET, etc). Also exploring whether to pursue a solo cash balance pension plan to increase my traditional contributions during my high earning years.

**Spending**

With Mint's demise, I stopped tracking monthly spend. For years, I set a target of staying under $4,000 a month (which was admittedly rare). Most months were $5,000-$6,000. Today, it's probably $8,000-$9,000 a month, but again I don't track it. I spend 3K a mont on rent, 1K a month for a car (payment, parking, insurance, gas) and too much on food and booze.

My general approach has been to focus more on money saved (and increasing income) over lowering my expenses. Mint, however, made me think about it a bit more--especially when I saw extremely high spend on food & dining, taxis & Ubers, and alcohol.

For a 5-year stretch, I'd pick a month each year to be intentionally frugal. It was a good reminder that despite increased expenses and lifestyle inflation, I could still bring expenses down significantly (I recall getting to $2,900 in monthly expenses once, which was over 50% rent).

**Goals**

No set FIRE number and no plans to change my approach. I will continue to max my IRA, 401K/MBD Roth, and HSA. 

I'd like to grow my business. I enjoy the work and the flexibility it provides. Growth will require a lot of work on my end with building a trusted team.

I also don't want to sacrifice my health or social relationships. I've spent considerable time focusing on improving health (5-6 days at the gym, 4 hours of cardio a week, mediation, healthier meals), but there's always more wood to chop.

financialindependence,bonus invest,Fired FIRE,"\*\*Edit:  we're in an US east coast HCOL area.  And I've always worked for software-oriented tech companies but never a FAANG.



Hey everyone, I'm a long-time (mostly) lurker who was getting close to my FIRE goals when I found myself staring down the business end of a layoff yesterday.  There's some gratitude, some humble brag and a whole lot of privilege and (for this sub) cliches to this post, so no hard feelings if you want to skip this one.

I'm 48M married to a 47F with two teenage kids.  I've been working various roles in the tech industry since I graduated debt free from an ivy league school in the late nineties.  That's (at least) one huge step up I've had in life.  I didn't learn about FIRE as a movement / concept until at least 7 or 8 years ago, but I've always saved and invested more than I earned.  Sure there were months were there were emergencies or a big budget item but on the whole that's been my natural approach to money and it has paid off.

As is often commented on in this sub, it has also been so important that my spouse is on the same page financially.  We spend on what matters to us but always live within our means.  We only have shared accounts, communicate ahead of time about any significant purchases and also for spending as it relates to our kids and family.

I'll be honest, probably because of being a pretty high earner almost my whole working life, and because I'm lazy, I've never followed an itemized budget.  Instead, for the last 6 or so years I've tracked our net worth (broken out by account) and overall spending.  So, we have a pulse on things but not a granular plan for how we spend.

Some facts and figures:

* No debt of any sort
* We've owned homes in the past but currently do not and have a two year lease at $3750 / mo
* \~$1.6M in retirement accounts
* \~2.5M in regular brokerage including \~715k in cash (money market) largely from the sale of our previous home a couple years ago.  We thought we might use the money to buy a new home so haven't re-invested it beyond the money market but have been very happy renting.  Turns out this is  great piece of mind to live off of.
* Last job was 240k base with \~100k more in cash and equity bonuses
* My wife works 20 hours a week for the local gov, not earning much money but it does give us access to good healthcare (plus she loves it)
* In the above I didn't include the roughly \~225k (combined) we have in 529s.  Not enough for all education options of course but a pretty solid amount as a foundation and we can figure out any other needs as a family when the time comes.
* So of the 4.1M networth, besides the 715k cash, it is basically VTI plus 10% bonds, and \~150k or so of stock in that last company.
* Target spending in retirement is 13-15k per month.  Corresponding fire target was \~4.5M at 3.5% SWR (with some wiggle room in the earlier years to spend a bit more since I'm not including social security or the boost from my wife's part time work or any other work I might pick up).

Yesterday I got the early morning group zoom (since this was a layoff and not a fired for cause sort of situation) followed later by HR+boss meeting.  I think they were confused why I was so calm and professional.  The job had been getting progressively worse and more stressful, but no doubt part of it was my own burnout and growing desire to move on from that job and industry.  I'd been there over 4 years.  Anyway, I did appreciate the package, which included 4 months severance and 6 months of covered cobra costs.

So that's it.  All those tough problems and upcoming deadlines I'd been stressing about are poofed into thin air.  I've got many ideas and plans for how to spend my time but am intentionally not going too crazy with that for the next month or so.  I'm going to focus on decompressing and improving my mental and physical health via regular exercise, regular sleep schedule and better food choices.

I feel so grateful to be in the position I'm in, to have some agency over what comes next.  Even if there's a prolonged downturn and dreaded sequence-of-returns trouble, I have a looong runway to find some appealing way to bridge the gap.

Thanks for listening!",185,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1m4b4pi/fired_fire/,1752970369.0,FanOfTamago,1m4b4pi,not_advice_seeking
financialindependence,bonus invest,Hit the 1m milestone today!,"I (32m, single) crossed the 1m line today!

Assets:

* Taxable brokerage: 688k
* 401k: 165k (about 2/3rd pre-tax, 1/3rd after-tax)
* Roth IRA: 28k
* HYSA: 48k
* Checking: 5k
* Money market: 10k
* Crypto: 61k (about 2/3rds BTC, 1/3rd ETH)

I don't own any property. I have stock in the company I work for but I doubt it will ever be worth anything unfortunately. I maintain a 70/30 US/Intl split with my investments, everything in broad market index funds.

Most of this wealth was built since mid 2021 when my income took off significantly. In 2024 (my best earning year) my take home was somewhere around 290k (not sure exactly yet until I do my taxes) and I spent 229k of that buying stocks. My living costs were around 50k and the rest went into HYSA. I live in an MCOL area and am pretty boring. I work remotely as a software engineer.

Here are my NW estimates for the start of every year since I graduated university (December 2013). I do not have good records until the start of 2024, so before that is just my best guess. I think it should mostly be within 20% or so:

|Year|NW|
|:-|:-|
|2014|\-60k|
|2015|\-40k|
|2016|0k|
|2017|40k|
|2018|50k|
|2019|30k|
|2020|25k|
|2021|100k|
|2022|300k|
|2023|450k|
|2024|657k|
|2025|973k|
|Jan 23, 2025|1005k|

A few inflection points worth elaborating on:

* Jan 2014: I start my career making 65k as a software engineer in Austin, TX.
* Mid 2017: I quit and move to Japan to teach English. I don't like it much (derp) and quit after a few months. I travel around east/southeast Asia for \~2 years. I freelance but make little money and burn through savings.
* Late 2019: I start a full time contract making $60/hour (about 120k/year doing 40 hour weeks). Few months later I move back to the US and in with my parents. I don't intend to stay long but then covid happens and I stay until mid 2021, keeping my expenses nice and low.
* Aug 2021: I have my own place and start a remote salaried position with a tech startup. Starting salary is 130k but that goes up to 265k by the start of 2024, with a bunch of bonuses thrown in at random times (they dangle those like carrots). Although they have paid me better than I had imagined, the company hasn't gained traction and may not last. Total comp for 2024 looks like it will come in a hair under 400k cash.

I used to consider 1m my FIRE number and still sorta do, with some caveats. I doubt I'll ever get married or have children, and I don't mind moving somewhere inexpensive overseas. I lived in Thailand for about a year (2018-2019) on less than 20k and had everything I needed. I'm also an EU citizen (Poland) in addition to US. But retiring on 1m still feels a bit risky to me long term. If I were to do it, I'd have to have a WR of like 2% so my nest egg can keep growing to cover future growing expenses (for medical care or whatnot).

In the event, I have no idea what I'd do with myself if I retired, so I have no intention of retiring any time soon. Semi-retirement or sabbaticals though, that's a different story and I like having those options. If the company I work for goes under like I suspect it might in the next year, I would probably take a few months off and then I'd consider part-time contract work instead of full-time salaried work. For now though, it's just going to be business as usual.

It feels nice to finally be able to write this, though seeing that number in my spreadsheet was anti-climactic. I feel fortunate that it was a relatively short journey for me (and with a break in between even). I'd be glad for any perspectives and happy to answer questions if anyone's curious about anything here. Wishing everyone the best of luck to meet your goals this year!

EDIT 3/18/2025: Due to the recent downturn I am no longer quite a millionaire. Of course I am not surprised because that's how this works, and I just knew the markets would dump right after (or right before) I crossed the line! I have some semblance of a plan now, but am still being flexible. I decided I wanted to increase cash to 75k (done) and then continue at my current job until it either goes under, or else until about a year from now, and then jump ship and take a break for a bit. I have an 11k tax bill I need to save up for that will take most of my next two paychecks. Then I can start buying stocks again with my end-of-April paycheck. I'm only going to buy international stocks until I reach 40% intl allocation, which will probably be never. I'm not going to sell to rebalance (certainly not in my taxable account at least) but I decided I'd like a higher intl allocation.

EDIT 5/15/2025: Back up to a million, and to a new record (1070k).",306,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1i8i80n/hit_the_1m_milestone_today/,1737677393.0,Excellent_Most8496,1i8i80n,not_advice_seeking

# My Story:

I am very fortunate to have gone to a top-20 college in the US and graduated with an engineering degree and 0 college debt, thanks to my parents and grandparents paying for my education. This was a tremendous gift, one I am forever thankful for

In my senior year, I landed a job for post-graduation as a mechanical engineer in a very undesirable city but with a great starting salary (80k). I knew I wanted to move away from where I grew up and where I went to school so I took it, and figured I could bail if I hated the city too much. This was the best decision I ever made for several reasons. First, I met an older coworker who told me about FIRE and how to maximize my workplace benefits, which were perfect for someone on the FIRE path (8% 401k match, 1k in to HSA, MBDR offered).  Second, the salary compared to the cost of living was ludicrous, enabling me to buy my first house at 23 and save a large percentage of my income. Most importantly, I met my husband there!

In late 2020/early 2021, my husband and I moved away from that city, and I took a paid transfer with the same employer to a more desirable location and a career pivot to software product management. This was a pretty major change, but was made possible by utilizing the network and reputation I had built at that company over the prior 5 years. I know there is a lot of advice here to jump around to maximize salary, but for me, staying at the same employer enabled me to take risks and make career changes that would have been extremely difficult otherwise. The employer paid for the move, including closing costs when I sold my original home, and paid a relocation bonus (see big pay spike in 2021). I was able to buy us a new home in our new city with the relo bonus and netted about \~160k from the sale of my first house. This came with golden handcuffs of needing to work for that employer for an additional 3 years, or pay back all the relocation money, plus tax.

In 2023, I finally left that employer and moved to a proper tech company rather than an engineering company with a software department. In that year, my husband and I also found an amazing deal on a large piece of property in our new city, and bought it with cash, with the goal of building our dream home there someday. It's a dream we've had ever since we first met, but we'll see if it's something we're actually willing to work extra years for as FIRE becomes more of a reality. If not, we'll sell the land and use it to pay off our primary residence.

Outside of work and finances, my husband and I have an big friend group and hobbies (music, maker space) that keep us very busy. I've also recently started volunteering once a week. I know this probably sounds exhausting to the introverts of the group, but between social events, hobby stuff, volunteering and dates, we probably have events 3-4 times a week. We both really like being busy and get bored easily, so this is ideal for us. It's a life I can easily see continuing, but with even more focus on hobbies and volunteering, post-FIRE.

What's next? We keep working and keep saving. My husband is now completely aboard the FIRE train (and is hitting milestones faster than I did!) so the next 5 years should be great for our net worth. We aren't planning on having kids, so no major changes there. Early in our relationship, we travelled a lot in the US, but now we're focusing more on international travel, with a goal of 1 big trip per year, which we've hit the last 2 years. We already have next year's trip planned (Greece!)

Happy to talk more about major career changes, having a partner who was not into FIRE but now is, property/land stuff, or any other questions you have in the comments. This post is already getting super long as it is!

# Advice:

* Don't take advice from people who make posts like this - everyone lives a unique life with privileges and luck that are not replicable for you.
* That said, here's my advice:
   * Who you choose as your spouse is truly the most important decision, but don't cross someone off just because they aren't at your level of saving in the beginning. Because FIRE is a niche community, many people who'd make great partners simply haven't been exposed to the idea or had a reason to consider it. Have those discussions early. Show them how you live a full life and still save. If you both value freedom, don't prioritize possessions/status and respect one another, then it's likely they'll want to join in.
   * Having a specific FIRE number/date is unrealistic until you're 1-2 years out. Your life will change in ways you cannot imagine between now and your target FIRE date, which will make your early projections way off. Just save the maximum that you feel comfortable saving and let life take its course.
   * Related to the above, FIRE is a continuum, not a binary. This mindset can make the boring middle more fun. You'll hit ""off-grid in a yurt"" FIRE, then ""trailer out in the boonies"" FIRE and then ""shitty one bedroom apartment"" FIRE on the way to the FIRE for your actual location and lifestyle. For me, this alleviated a lot of financial anxiety, knowing that I already have enough to be fed and sheltered in the US, albeit not where and how I want.",113,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1mhnjto/fire_progress_10_years_working_1m_nw_800k_invested/,1754336559.0,Just_Nice_Things,1mhnjto,not_advice_seeking

financialindependence,bonus invest,8 year FIRE update: $877k at 29,"[Previous post from 2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/673wqp/just_started_my_first_job_give_me_a_sanity_check/)

# Income

My salary increased more or less linearly from $93k in 2017 to $143k in 2025

I have had a few bonuses during this time, but nothing significant

I'm still at the same job I was at 8 years ago. Yes, I almost certainly could have made more if I moved around and generally been more serious with my career while the tech industry was popping off. But I detest interviewing and I'm fairly comfortable where I'm at. It stresses me out sometimes, but I think a new job would stress me out even more

# Expenses 

My expenses were around $20k for the first ~5 years or so 

I had at least one roommate until 2 years ago. I now rent alone

I haven't owned a car in 2 years. That's mostly for health reasons (it forces me to walk quite a bit) but the financial benefits are nice. Plus (as is probably the case for a lot of us in the FIRE community) I guess I just get some kind of satisfaction from going against the grain and doing things ""my way""

For the past 3 years, I have worked remotely from a ~MCOL area rather than the HCOL area my office is at 

My expenses for the past couple of years have been around $40k

I am engaged. We met online and have been dating 3 years. She recently got her fiancée visa after a year-long process and will be moving here in a few months. I think that will likely bring my expenses down, even if only because I will no longer be going on ~2 trips a year to the faraway VHCOL country where she now lives. Regardless, I am very excited that she is finally coming and I believe it will increase my quality of life a lot 

Admittedly, I haven't tracked my expenses super closely, I've paid a coarse kind of attention to these things and believe the figures are reasonably accurate. I will definitely have to pay more attention to this when I get closer to taking any kind of drastic action like early retirement

# Net worth

$877k total

$390k post-tax brokerage
$452k retirement accounts
$35k emergency fund/cash for upcoming expenses

# Investment strategy

## Accounts

I401k and Roth/Trad IRA: maxed every year
HSA: I put a bit in it, though I know I should really max it out too 
The rest goes in a brokerage account

## Allocation

I'm almost 100% in index funds - about 75% US and 25% International
I have a few individual stocks, though they're not really significant
I should probably be going towards bonds at some point, though I'm not sure when that point is

# Looking back

I recognize that I've been very fortunate in many ways
- Graduated with no debt and a $10k NW (scholarships and a part-time job through high school and college)
- Knew about and applied FIRE principles from the moment my career started
- Had a salary much higher than most people my age
- Grew up with frugal parents, so living frugally came naturally to me
- Crazy bull market (note the commenter in my 2017 post that said we in the tail-end of the bull market)

# Looking forward

## My number

4% was the SWR I had in my head until recently, but I've become convinced that 4% is too high for a very early retirement. 3.25% is what people smarter than me have said, so that's what I'm now targeting. I am also thinking that a paid off home would probably be a good thing 

Right now I'm looking at $50k'ish to account for health insurance and give some buffer. I don't want to be living on the absolutely bare minimum to live. I want to have something to cut back on in down years

That puts my number at around $1.5MM

This number is without kids, which may be in my future. Again, all of the above are things I'd dig into more before taking drastic action

## My plan 

My plan for the immediate future, the thing that gets me out of bed every workday, is to make it 2 more years in my current job, then re-evaluate. That will put me at some nice round numbers - 10 years at my job, and (hopefully) ~1MM in my accounts. I'll also have a better idea of my life looks like in general. Things will probably change a lot after marrying

From there, I am considering some mixture of sabbaticals and coasting. Right now a straightforward manual job like a janitor sounds nice. Or working on an indie game for a year or two with no expectations of making money
It's also entirely possible I'll just keep plugging away as long as I can and shooting for full FIRE

I have also developed a health issue that is a complicating factor. I've had chronic neck pain for several years, which I think is more or less directly attributably to my desk job and my poor posture therein. With care and exercise, it has gotten better over the past year or so and I am hopeful it will continue to improve. But I really think that an entire normal-length career of doing a desk job just won't be possible for me. Another reason to become FI

financialindependence,getting started investing,"After 10 years, I am now a millionaire.","Man, it feels incredible just to type it.

Proof [here](https://imgur.com/KCYD9qH). Screenshot of the first 9 years 8 months [here](https://imgur.com/un7VnlI) (damn you Mint for shutting down!) and the last 8 months [here](https://imgur.com/8d1JGiw). Okay, so it's been 10 years and 4 months to be precise. Close enough.

My last update was when I hit [$500k](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/n1jzmo/went_from_1k_to_501k_in_exactly_7_years/) 3 years ago, with my first-ever update ($100k) [7 years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/6e74o6/24m_hit_100k_nw_on_friday/). So 3 years to 100k, 4 more years to $500k, and just 3 years to $1mm, despite higher spending. The snowball effect is real.

So what's changed since that last update 3 years ago? Honestly, not much. 

* Still have the same job, making ~$160-170k. I guess I've stagnated income-wise, but I enjoy my job, and it pays *enough,* so it's fine?

* Still have same house. It's no longer worth what it was in 2021. I know this because I'm trying to sell it. Austin is one of (if not *the*) worst housing markets in the country right now. Timing was never my strong suit; it's too bad time in the market does *not* beat timing the market when it comes to selling houses....

* Still have the same car. It's no longer worth what it was in 2021. Fortunately I'm not really trying to sell it, at least not until I finish selling the house. I did rent a CyberTruck earlier this year, and while I really do like it, I honestly think renting it kinda got some of the enthusiasm out of my system, at least for now.

* I'm still very cash heavy. Even more than last time. Because I'm still trying to buy a damn house. That said, the goals have shifted a little there, though I don't really want to discuss it on social media just yet. Let's just say it'll be a new chapter in my life.

* My spending is up to $42k as of last year. I expect it'll be ~$56k this year, if I *don't* buy a house. It's not really due to ""lifestyle creep"" in the traditional sense in my case (though definitely a little bit is), but rather doing work on my house to get it ready for sale, as well as traveling, which I'm starting to do more of. Just got back from eastern Europe, which isn't *quite* as cheap as they say (at least compared to Texas), but still affordable. As a single person, 3 weeks cost me ~$3k all-in, including snagging a deal on flights and sleeping in hostels.

* And I could basically copy and paste the last bullet of my last update: Of course, this whole time, I’ve been consistently plowing 50%+ of income into investments and cash savings. Usually 60%+. My goal has always been to save at least 50% of my income at any given time. This, in my opinion, is KEY!

So that's it. Slow and steady... may not win the race, but gets you there reasonably quickly and reliably.

What's next? Starting that aforementioned new life-chapter, inviting a little more lifestyle creep, and eventually, FI. I'm defining FI as $1mm invested + a paid-off (and renovated to taste) house, so I still have a few more years to go. Maybe by age 35 will be doable? Certainly before 40, which was my original goal.

financialindependence,getting started investing,Logged Off For the Last Time Today,"It's done.  Still seems hard to believe and surreal and I'm sure it's going to take a while to really sink in.  At age 53, after roughly 25 years of spending less than we earn and investing the difference, I've decided this is it.  I was able to arrange a layoff so that I'll get severance until next June and health benefits until next April before we switch over to my wife's healthcare plan.  She wants to keep working for now but we'll see how long that lasts.

It really works.  We started doing most of the things that people talk about here many years ago before people were using the ""FIRE"" terminology.  We almost always maxed our 401k accounts (not quite at the beginning with lower incomes and not near the end as compounding started doing most of the work), we spent less than we earned, we bought things on sale and always tried to moderate our spending.  We didn't deprive ourselves of everything along the way but we also didn't live extravagantly.  By most people's measures, they'd say we were living pretty good.  I guess it's all relative.

Final net worth number at retirement: $3.7M.  It has really shot up over the last few years.  I've posted previously about our net worth progression if you want to check my post history.  Basically it took us about 17 years to hit the first million, (1998-2015), 4 years to hit $2M, 3 years to hit $3M and now we are at about $3.7M.  Salaries started at about $32K for me and less for my wife.  She also took a few years off when our child was born.  At the end my salary had climbed to $155K and my wife is at $75K.  It certainly got easier as our salaries increased but we made sure not to let our lifestyle inflate too much along with the salaries.  We also never carried a credit card balance and started paying cash for pretty much everything, cars included, many years ago. (We focused on reliable Honda's and Toyota's)  It's amazing how cheaply you can live once your house is paid off and you have no other debt.  I recognize it's more difficult to do that now.  We were lucky to be in GenX where you could still buy a house for a reasonable price.  That certainly helped our net worth progression but it wasn't the only reason we were successful.

Thanks to everyone's contributions here.  I've learned a ton from the community and I think having everyone reinforcing the right strategies and methods and sharing knowledge helps us all.  Cheers!

financialindependence,getting started investing,People who are already FI - what gives you purpose?,"I’m not sure if there’s any way to write this post without coming across as a privileged douchebag, but I’m hoping some FI folks might relate or can share how they’ve tackled a similar experience, even if on a different timeline.

Through a series of fortunate circumstances, I’m now closer to FI way faster than I had expected. I guess I’m already LeanFI, based on my current expenses. And now I’m having an existential crisis.

—

For context, I’m 25. NW $950k. Currently on track to spend about $30k this year while traveling the world.

I was born in the US to an upper middle class Asian immigrant family in the suburbs. We lived fairly frugally growing up because of my parents’ immigrant background, although we were never lacking in anything important. 

There was always food on the table, and our family never struggled to pay the bills. For K-12, I went to our local public schools, which had excellent teachers, and I got a pretty good education growing up. I ended up going to a fairly prestigious state college, which my parents very generously paid for.

In college, I “played the game”. I studied hard, did a double major in Computer Science and Business, grinded for internships, and landed a well-paying tech job after graduating.

After I started my new job, I lived way below my means. I spent roughly $30-40k a year, which meant I was saving over 70% of my income, but I also didn’t feel like I was particularly limiting myself since I was living much more luxuriously than I was in college. One of my few spending regrets is choosing to live in a cheaper apartment close to work rather than the VHCOL big city 1.5 hours away, which most of my peers were doing. I think my social life did suffer a bit from living in a suburb instead of a big city. That said, I still got to go on fun weekend excursions, vacations, and worked remotely for 1-2 week stretches from different places around North America.

Over the course of 3 years, my NW ballooned, thanks to my high income, aggressive investing, and strong market performance. On top of that, a completely lucky speculative buy of NVDA a few years back exploded from $15k to $200k+. (I now only invest in broad market index funds, which make up 70% of my portfolio)

Earlier this year, I felt increasingly frustrated with my lack of autonomy at work. It felt like I was just repeating a cycle of waking up, working all day, and coming back with just enough time to eat dinner and scroll social media for 1-2 hours. 

Realizing I needed to break out of this routine, I decided to quit my job to go on a 1-year travel sabbatical, something I had always dreamed of doing when I was younger. And over the last few months, I’ve traveled throughout Southeast Asia, spending between $1.5k - $2k a month while having some pretty incredible experience including scuba diving, learning Muay Thai, and riding a motorcycle across Vietnam. 

At the same time, my investments continued to grow, way outpacing my spending. My NW has increased by over 3x what I saved for this trip to begin with, which was kind of a shock to my system. I realized that if I wanted to, I could just keep doing this indefinitely and probably be just fine. The math checks out. 

I had expected to continue grinding away at work until I was at least 35 before achieving FI. I actually enjoyed a lot of the aspects of my old job, including collaborating with smart teammates, working on a variety of challenging problems, and socializing with my peers. But now that I know there’s no financial pressure for me to go back into my old career, I’m not sure what I want to do after my travels are over.

Every day I can feel the existential dread creeping in—what’s the purpose of life?

It’s compounded by the fact that I’m actively doing the bucket list thing I’d always dreamed of doing, but still feeling that sense of emptiness. Since I’m relatively young / early-career, I also haven’t had many experiences to build off of to give me a stronger sense of direction. I also struggle with the thought that  “I don’t deserve this”, knowing how much of a factor privilege and luck played for me to get in my current position. I suspect the path forward is experimenting with working on things that are more inherently fulfilling, but I’m finding it hard to zoom out to see what all the possibilities are.

So I’d like to ask FI folks who may have gone through something similar - what gives you purpose today? If you FIRE’d at a young age, what do you plan on doing with the rest of your life?

**TL;DR** - Got close to FI way faster and way younger than expected. Having an existential crisis while traveling the world. Wondering what gives other people meaning / purpose after becoming FI.

**UPDATE:** Appreciate all the thoughtful responses from everyone :) One of my favorite threads so far, and I’m looking forward to reading more. Will sit on them and see where it takes me.

financialindependence,getting started investing,The Slow Path to Wealth Was Quicker Than Advertised,"I've been tracking my finances since before I graduated college. I'm now 37 years old and have over 15 years of data on this path. We’re currently sitting at a net wealth of $1.6m, with 99% of that in low-cost index funds spread between Roth IRAs, 401ks, and taxable brokerage accounts.

The four main drivers to reaching this point were lots of luck, keeping a savings rate around 60-70% over the years, continuous investing in low-cost index funds since 2009, and my wife changing careers to become a high earner six years ago. That last point has been a game-changer, which pushed our income up to levels I could've never imagined.

**To sum it up, here was my/our path:** 

* Graduated university with $20k in debt, largely from the help of parents and grandparents. I am forever grateful for the help they provided in allowing me to start with some debt (so I could learn to get myself out of it) but not crippling debt.
* Started a corporate job earning $55k while spending just $15k annually (though I immediately hated the work and did so for the entirety of the  five years I worked in corporate).
* With a despise of the corporate job but a love of travel, I took off periods of time to travel in my 20s and did so very frugally with extended travel in lower cost destinations. I visited 60 countries and all seven continents by the time I turned 30.
* In my late 20s, I switched careers into tourism so I could travel for work, interact with people, and share my love of travel with others. I fell in love with my profession and still love my work 10 years on.
* Got married and, soon after, my wife switched careers and quickly tripled her income.
* Now with three young kids and living in Japan - enjoying the free daycare and the zero-cost health care for the kids, both of which are a massive help financially compared to the life we'd be living had we stayed in the US.

**Spending**

* Annual spend: $60,000-$70,000.
* Our attitude towards spending over the past few years has changed dramatically in a positive way. Throughout our 20s and early 30s, both my wife and I were very frugal. It’s how we were able to travel, take time off from work, etc. Price was almost always the first thing we looked at - on menus, flights, second hand clothes.
* Throughout those years, we felt like we had more time than money, so we were happy to take the local bus rather than a taxi, board the 5AM flight rather than the comfortable but higher-priced 9AM flight, and pack lunches to take to work rather than dining out. 
* Now with the combination of a nice nest egg and the busy life of three kids under 5 years old, we feel like we have more money than time. We pay for the more convenient parking, order what we feel like eating at the restaurant rather than choosing the cheapest option, and pay a premium for direct flights that depart at a reasonable hour. 
* We have dramatically changed our spending habits, and we have finally begun to enjoy spending money. Knowing that we can afford these experiences and things makes it all the sweeter.

**Our FIRE number**

* Like many, our FIRE number has increased throughout the years. I was thinking that $1.5m would be our number, but now we’re thinking $2m is our number. This is partly due to renting a bigger apartment with a growing family, purchasing nicer items that will hopefully last longer, and paying for more conveniences to save time and energy.
* The biggest unknown for us is whether we send our kids through Japanese public school or private school, or, in the most likely scenario, a mix depending on the attitudes of the kids and the ages in which we would potentially try to get them into a private school. Private school costs around $15-20k per year per child, so potentially up to $60k per year for several years. 
* Our net wealth has increased faster than I ever imagined. I looked back at projections I put together in 2018, and I expected us to be around $1m in 2025. Instead, we’re at $1.6m. 
* Since neither my wife nor I plan to quit our jobs any time soon, we feel like we’re in a great spot. At the current rate, I think we may be at around $3m when we’re in our late 40s. I believe getting to $3m would give us more money than we would ever need (I type this knowing that is what everyone says until they get there).
* With that said, if either of us wanted to quit working completely or to change jobs, we would support each other to make the move.

financialindependence,getting started investing,Small Boring Middle Rant,"I'm currently in the boring middle, 37M, wife 2 kids.  I think for people who are on a longer trajectory to FIRE and shooting for age 50+ there's this idea you just have to ""get through the boring middle."" But there's a point at which that boring middle is actually what your life is.  You can do boring for a little bit but can you do it for 20 years? It's tough.  As you get older (I know i'm not particularly old) you start to realize nothing is promised, especially as you age, and that the boring middle is actually your life. so you might want to invest in it some.

financialindependence,getting started investing,Is anyone in here not super high income or not DINKs?,"So many of the posts in here are DINKs or DI1Ks earning $300k+ a year in income. Is anyone in here making a normal income like $75k-100k? And what's your strategy to get to FI/RE? I ask because I'm 24 and a SI1K (is that a word?). Current net worth around $90k (40k roth, 30k brokerage, 10k cash, 10k in our house just bought) and adding about $1500/month to investments on a medium income with goal to retire by 60-65. Starting next year, will be putting around $2500/month. I want to hear from the people who are making normal incomes, if any exist. 

edit: i still appreciate the DINK and DI1K posts, don't get me wrong they're very motivating. Just would help to see if there is someone in a similar boat

Edit 2: thank you so much for all the insight. Didnt expect it. Also, yes I’m aware average income in America is closer to $50k.

financialindependence,how much to save,Reached $1M Net Worth today while never making $100K a year.,"Wanted to share with the fine folks here that I've reached this milestone today.  It took me 30 years to get here but finally reached the 2 comma club net worth wise while never making more than $85K in any working year.

46 single male, no kids.  Started working at 16 in fast food for a couple of years and started saving here and there.  When I turned 18 my friend got me a job sorting mail in a magazine subscription fulfillment company.  I did that for a few years while going to school to get my associates degree in nursing.  When I graduated in 2005 I immediately bought a condo using a stated income mortgage application (those were the days! The loan officer just assumed how much money I'll be making without checking if it was true!) for $185K at 6%.  Refinanced it down over the years to my final rate of 2.99% in 2021.  I owe around $100K on the loan while redfin and zillow are estimating my property to be worth about $405K.

  
Still work at the first hospital that hired me in 2005.  Participated in the 401K plan as soon as I was eligible and contributed enough to get the full max at the start. Increased my contribution limits every year until I was able to max out my yearly contributions.

  
Here is the full breakdown:

401K - $476,331

Roth IRA - $78,517

Brokerage $94,321

Cash/Emergency Fund - $79,712

Condo value - $405K

Mortgage balance -  $100,229

Net worth - $1,033,652

  
No credit card debt, only liability is my mortgage.  I have a Toyota that I bought new in 2013 that I paid off within 2 years, still runs great and I plan on driving it into the ground.

  
My next goal is to have $1M in liquid assets by the time I'm 50 and hopefully retire with 2 million in assets and a paid off condo by 60.  

  
So there you have it, no high income, single earner, took a lot longer than other folks on here, but still technically a millionaire.",4168,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1mbs1kc/reached_1m_net_worth_today_while_never_making/,1753735961.0,Neinhaltt,1mbs1kc,not_advice_seeking
financialindependence,how much to save,Looking back on twenty years of early retirement.,"The twentieth anniversary of my early retirement’s coming up on July fifteenth, and I’ve been asked for retrospection & introspection. Well...gather ‘round, children, and let Father Time regale you with the wisdom of the ages, or at least whatever senile fuckery pops into his grizzled old head. 

I'm fifty-six now, and I hate admitting that the touch of grey is becoming more than a touch. But as I’ve gotten older my views and lifestyle have become simpler rather than more complicated, which is nice. And while I’m WAAAAAAAAY underqualified to get into the technical complexities of the FIRE process, thirteen years of working towards FIRE and twenty years of living it have given me time to work out a bit of philosophy.

Or maybe I'm just talking bullshit. 

Either way, feel free to ask questions and/or challenge me and/or fart in my general direction, but know that I travel for extended periods of time and I’m about to hit the road for a few months. May or may not get back to you. Perhaps that’s for the best.

Here goes.

——

The E=MC^(2) of FIRE is: “Work towards having something to sell besides your time.” You can derive everything else from that statement. 

Edit: I get into a few of those derivations [below](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1lnxgdg/comment/n0oln83/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).

——

You need a strong vision for your post-career life. People who say, “I can’t imagine what I’d do if I retired,” probably won’t.

——

It’s FAR better to move towards something positive than away from something negative.

Although here’s as good a motivation to work towards FIRE as any: you’ll get to shop for groceries on Tuesday mornings when there’s nobody there and the produce trucks have just hit the store.

——

Money is the wrench, not the machine.

It can’t buy you happiness, but it CAN buy you more time to find it. That said, you don’t need to be rich & retired to do so. I see too many people treating FIRE like a glorified geographical cure, as in: “If I could only quit my job I’d be happy.” But we know how that works: you carry your problems wherever you go.

So what if you worked on your personal issues as much as you work on your FIRE plan? Is it possible you could find contentment in your present situation? Would you still need to quit to be happy?

——

Back in the day I rarely discussed my FIRE plan. I learned that the hard way from a couple of family members who gave me the whole flabbergasted “Mark my words: you’ll be living under a highway overpass someday!” schtick. Meaning FIRE is risky. But risky as compared to what? The risk of shoving pixels across a desk for forty years?

Fuck all that. I’ve never felt more at risk than when I was working in corporate America.

——

It takes a lot of self-discipline to make FIRE happen, which most people seem capable of, but you have to be careful about it. For instance, I put a shit-ton of pressure on my ex to save money, too much, and it permanently damaged our relationship.

——

Which: know that it’s possible to navigate a divorce without jeopardizing your FIRE status. We split everything up the middle and walked away with friendship and respect and—most importantly—our (adult) daughter’s love for us intact.

Neither of us have returned to work.

——

If you’re new to the idea of FIRE, understand that your FIRE/life balance can be as tricky, or trickier, than your work/life balance.

If you go all-in for it, you’ll be making big changes in your life, not all of which are comfortable. The pursuit of FIRE can mean you’ll be socializing less—a dirty martini is like seventeen bucks in my hometown now—so your relationships may suffer. You’ll be downsizing your vacations, you’ll be working harder and chasing promotions from company to company, you’ll be considering geographical arbitrage a lot more seriously, etc. etc. etc. It piles on. 

——

Ego death is a thing. As I’ve said before:

It's easy to confuse your career with your identity. In the US, at least, we tend to introduce ourselves to strangers with what we do for a living rather than who we are in life. “I consult for a company that sells golf ball dimples” rather than “I’m a swordfighter in the Society for Creative Anachronism.”

So when you reach FIRE and you wad up your career and toss it over your shoulder, you’re probably tossing a good bit of your self-identity with it. But the question’ll soon arise: NOW who am I?

——

Don’t buy into the bullshit that you’re not retired if you earn a little money at something, especially a hobby. The work ethic that enables people to FIRE doesn’t vanish the instant they quit. And besides, none of us are entitled to judge each other's standards of retirement. An ye harm none, do what ye will.

——

You want to talk about LeanFIRE: there used to be a guy named Daniel Suelo who lived in a cave outside Moab, UT and lived mostly on the societal waste stream. He didn’t handle money in any form for something like fifteen years. I thought he was just as retired as I was—unconventionally, true, but he’d figured out a way to avoid employment while keeping body and soul together AND living in accordance with what seemed like reasonable ethical principles, such as, “Reduce/reuse/recycle,” and “Don’t desecrate your soul.” He got criticized for freeloading library internet connections at the expense of taxpayers, but there are greater sins.

——

IME to maximize both your enjoyment of FIRE and of life in general, you’ve gotta get out there and struggle. Don’t stagnate. I have occasionally, and it sucks.

——

Exercise and eat healthy, man, because there’s a lot of fun to be had in the world, and you’re just the person to have it. 

——

You’ve also gotta maintain your mental acuity. Do complicated intellectual-type shit, even if it’s no more than playing a difficult video game.

——

On gaming: I get why people might think it’s a waste of time. BUT: one of my main social outlets is playing Fortnite, God help me, with a group of my good friends who are scattered around the country. We do this late nights two or three times a week. I’d rather be playing anything other than Fortnite, even Jamming Bamboo Splinters Under My Toenails Simulator, but this is how my buddies and I keep in touch. Otherwise our relationships would’ve fizzled out years ago.

——

After I got divorced I built out a Sprinter van and hit the road for a couple of years. It was fun and I was surprised by how economical the lifestyle was. But I finally roosted, and when I did, I splurged on an expensive apartment. It has a great view, great amenities, and sits in a coveted location. 

I also bought, which still seems preposterous, a $200 coffee machine. I drink coffee all day long and I want it to taste like something. And there’s no way I’m gonna be able to operate an Aeropress when I’m barely awake enough to remember where the kitchen is.

It was SO hard to splurge on myself. I’ve been scrimping my way through life ever since I was in my mid-twenties because of my FIRE plan, goddammit, and it took a HUGE mental/emotional effort to break through my thriftiness and spend money on stuff that was “frivolous.”

Don't be like that. It's OK to treat yourself occasionally.

——

For those who might be curious, my finances are pretty dull. As of this writing I'm worth about—

Well, fuck. I'm worth about $4.39 a pound if you grind me into hamburger, but I hate that phrase, ""I'm worth."" I'm worth a hell of a lot more than that, and a hell of a lot less, depending on who you ask.

Anyway, here's where I was going. I own about $2.4 million in financial assets as of this writing, a Sprinter van worth maybe $50K, and no real estate. Pay the credit card off monthly. I live on around 2.5% of my financial assets per year--not the 3% that I quoted off the top of my head elsewhere. I've moved away from a mix of individual equities and index funds and diversified into target retirement date funds at Vanguard, laddered in five-year increments. That's not fully efficient, which I need to work on.

But yeah, my finances are dull. Dull is key.

——

In conclusion:

As I said, I just turned fifty-six, and you know something funny about that? 

When you’re thirty-six and tell people you’re retired, they think: unicorn. But when you’re fifty-six and tell people you’re retired, they think: meh. Might still be a bit young to make an exit, but you’re no longer a mythical beast…you’re just an ordinary dude in the post-career phase of his life. Plenty like you out there. Don’t feel special.

And I don't.

Edit: expect edits.

**Edit #1:** hey, since Reddit is telling me that so far this post has gotten 339,000 views, it's evidently a good platform, so something OT I feel compelled to mention is this. It's made a HUGE quality of life difference for me.

Across time I blew out my hearing with loud music and power tools. Now I've got high-frequency hearing loss and tinnitus. I've worn commercial hearing aids before, but they're expensive and they suck. Maybe six months ago I bought a pair of Apple AirPods Pro, second generation. They incorporate hearing aid technology which I've found to be INCREDIBLY good at correcting my hearing. I'm hearing shit I haven't heard in years even with traditional hearing aids, like the high hat in recorded music. Plus they make my tinnitus go away when I wear them, which traditional hearing aids rarely did.

They also take away the stigma/psychological barrier that hearing aids are for old people. Seems like everybody goes around with AirPods or whatever, so I'm not at all self-conscious about wearing them. Plus they're only $200-ish a pair, whereas standard hearing aids are more like $3,500.

Maybe that can help other people; I don't know. But for the love of god, if you've got good hearing, wear hearing protection in loud environments.

**Edit #2.** I'm surprised nobody has asked me what motivated me to start chasing FIRE all those years ago. It was simply this: I'm NOT cut out for corporate America, AT ALL.

While I was in grad school I worked in an extremely fun part-time job with fantastic perks. It was NOT an office job. I quit that job and got an office job when I graduated because I'd bought into the bullshit protestant work ethic and the idea that a ""good job"" meant white collar. This was drilled into me by my parents. I'm the oldest child, btw.

I worked on the third floor of our building. It had floor-to-ceiling glass windows. I remember standing at one of them on a gorgeous summer day shortly after I hired on and thinking, fuck me, all my friends are out drinking beer at the lake. At that very moment I went back to my desk and called up Lotus 123--dating myself; I was twenty-three at the time--and started modeling my plan. The model was extremely naive, but it was a start.",1668,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1lnxgdg/looking_back_on_twenty_years_of_early_retirement/,1751254112.0,ER10years_throwaway,1lnxgdg,not_advice_seeking
financialindependence,how much to save,How I Saved Money by Living Full-Time on a Cruise,"Update: Given the high amount of DMs I’ve gotten in response, I’m putting together a more detailed breakdown of the post below. If you’re interested in it please DM and I’ll add you to the list. Thanks! 


Hey FIRE fam, I want to share a little experiment I’ve been doing that might sound crazy at first, but hear me out—it’s been a game-changer. A few months ago, I decided to give up my overpriced apartment and start living full-time on a cruise ship. Yep, you read that right. And spoiler alert: it’s been cheaper than renting in a High Cost of Living (HCOL) city like Boston or NYC, and honestly, way more fun.

Let me walk you through how this all started, why I did it, and what the experience has been like.

The Setup

I live (or used to live) in Boston, where rent for a decent 1-bedroom apartment is around $3,500/month. Add in utilities, groceries, gym memberships, and entertainment, and I was easily spending $4,500+ per month. It was a lot, especially since I’m aggressively saving for FIRE.

One day, I came across an article about someone who lived on a cruise ship full-time, and it got me thinking. I crunched the numbers and realized a budget or mid-tier cruise could cost me $2,000–$4,000 per month, including housing, food, and entertainment. It sounded insane at first, but I decided to give it a shot.

How I Did It

I started with a month-long cruise in the Caribbean to test the waters (pun intended). I booked an interior cabin on a budget-friendly cruise line for around $2,000. That price included:
	•	A private cabin (way cozier than my apartment, TBH).
	•	Unlimited meals, from buffets to sit-down dinners.
	•	Entertainment every night—live music, Broadway-style shows, poolside movies, you name it.
	•	Utilities like electricity, heating, and even basic Wi-Fi.

By the end of the month, I was hooked. It wasn’t just a vacation—it felt like a lifestyle upgrade. I extended my stay and have been “living at sea” ever since.

Why It’s Better Than Renting
	1.	💸 Cheaper Than My Apartment:
My all-in costs for a month on the cruise were $2,500 (including gratuities and a few drinks). Compare that to $4,500+ for city living, and I’m saving at least $2,000/month.
	2.	🍔 No Grocery Bills:
Imagine eating every meal at a restaurant without ever worrying about the bill. That’s my reality now. From omelets in the morning to steak dinners at night, the food is amazing—and unlimited.
	3.	🎭 Built-In Entertainment:
Forget Netflix. I get live shows, comedy acts, karaoke nights, and pool parties every day. There’s no such thing as boredom on a cruise.
	4.	🌍 Travel Included:
My “home” docks in new destinations every few days. So far, I’ve been to Mexico, Jamaica, and the Bahamas, all without paying for flights or hotels.
	5.	🛠 No Chores, Ever:
I don’t clean, cook, or even make my bed. The crew takes care of everything, giving me so much more free time to work on hobbies, read, or just relax.

The Numbers (How It Adds Up)

Here’s a quick breakdown of my monthly costs compared to my old apartment:

Expense	Living on Land	Living on a Cruise
Rent	$3,500	$0
Utilities (Heat, etc.)	$200	$0
Groceries	$600	$0
Entertainment	$200	$0
Cruise Fare	$0	$2,500
Total	$4,500	$2,500

I’m saving $24,000/year while living a life that feels like a permanent vacation.

Is It for Everyone?

Probably not. But if you’re flexible with work (I’m remote), enjoy traveling, and don’t mind cozying up in a small cabin, it’s worth trying. Some things to keep in mind:
	•	Wi-Fi: It’s not lightning-fast, but it works for emails and basic browsing.
	•	Seasickness: I’ve adjusted, but Dramamine is your best friend.
	•	Laundry: Some cruises have self-service laundry or full-service for a fee.

Ready to Try It? Start Here:

If you’re curious, here are a few sites I used to book cruises:
	•	CruiseSheet – Great deals, especially for longer voyages.
	•	Vacations To Go – Tons of discounts on budget and mid-tier cruises.
	•	Cruise Critic – Helpful reviews and tips.

TL;DR: I gave up my overpriced Boston apartment to live full-time on a cruise. It’s cheaper, more fun, and I’m hitting my FIRE goals faster than ever. Have any of you thought about doing this? Would you give it a try? Let me know—I’m happy to answer questions! 🚢🔥",1180,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1i03v0a/how_i_saved_money_by_living_fulltime_on_a_cruise/,1736735518.0,theHungryNinja1809,1i03v0a,advice_seeking
financialindependence,how much to save,the first million really is the hardest,"Net worth milestones: 

* Jan 1, 2000: $0
* Jan 17, 2021: $1MM
* July 23, 2025: $2MM

Four years ago, I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/kxzmmj/after_a_20_year_grind_today_i_am_officially_a/) about hitting $1MM. I started saving for retirement in earnest sometime in 2000. So it took me a little over 20 years to achieve that first milestone. A little less than four years later, I now get to post about hitting the $2MM mark. I lost the NW history from my $1MM post (RIP Mint). But [here's growth](https://imgur.com/a/dzClUHr) over the last couple of years since I started tracking in Empower. It really is amazing how much quicker that 2nd million milestone came thanks to compound growth. 

Nothing much has changed between $1MM and $2MM. I've continued to max out all tax-advantaged retirement accounts: 401k, backdoor Roth, HSA. I also continue to DCA $1k/month into an after-tax brokerage account. I turn 50 this year, and retirement goal is $2.5MM at 55. So I should be well on-track if I just hold the course.

financialindependence,how much to save,[6 year update] 38/m/single. $2.3 million. Submitted my resignation letter today. Thank you guys for the encouragement all these years.,"Hi, r/financialindependence. I hope you are well. I posted when I quit my full-time office job in 2018, six years ago. I'm 44 now. It's been a nice ride through FIRE since, have spent a lot of time with my family and travelling. The story so far (skip to Today Year 6 at the bottom if you just want to know what's up at this very moment) ...

**Day 1 - I quit.**

https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/8pv2yd/38msingle_23_million_submitted_my_resignation/

>I have had this job for over a decade out of grad school. Pay is solid, hours are great and I didn't hate the work, but my heart has been out of it for awhile. Salary varied anywhere from $70,000 to $130,000 during those 14 years or so. I live in a state with low cost of living and no state income tax, so I knew when I started that I could save a majority of my income if I stayed frugal and resisted lifestyle inflation. I live in the same starter home I bought around 2010 and drive an old Camry. I did a bunch of set-it-and-forget-it buying of large cap US index funds and Berkshire Hathaway and I did some individual buying of large cap bank and technology names before and after the Great Recession

**Year 1 update - I volunteered in southeast Asia as a teacher in Bangkok.**

https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/bk1rco/1_year_update_38msingle_23_million_submitted_my/

>I moved to Thailand to volunteer at a non-profit teaching English to former prostitutes and low-level criminals for tourism industry jobs. 
I knew the cost of living in Bangkok would be substantially cheaper than what I am used to paying, but I was not prepared as to how much cheaper. My apartment and utilities were provided for free by the non-profit and I lived with my fellow expat volunteers. Some were older couples who wanted their privacy, so they booked their own apartments. Costs ranged from as low as $200 a month for a cheap, non-furnished studio apartment to $375 a month for a furnished studio in a newer building near a Skytrain station in the center of town with security. I was pleasantly surprised that because I was in the country on a sponsored work visa, I was eligible to buy health insurance there as a local. It came out to about $150 a month. Getting international expat health insurance here in America would have cost me up to $500 a month, so a huge savings. I also rarely ate at home and never cooked, since Bangkok is one of the great street food capitals of the world. All kinds of Thai, Chinese, Malay, Indian and Arab food served on the street for about 35 to 70 baht each entree (~1 to 2 bucks USD). I ended up not getting a local cell phone or local cell plan, my Sprint plan included international roaming and the 2G data was okay for Google Maps and web/email use when I was away from wifi, which was rare. So monthly fixed expenses came out to [...] $850/month total. Let's say I had to get my own furnished apartment and pay for my utilities, add another $500 a month. $1,350 a month total is pretty good considering I lived like a king and didn't budget myself at all. I could get that below $1,000 a month if I was more frugal.
Also - about three or four months after I moved to Thailand, my former boss called me to see how I was and offered me an online-only job, where I would spend about an hour to 90 minutes a day remotely reviewing other people's work, answering internal emails and listening to ideas he would bounce off of me. I wasn't interested, but he insisted it would not be my old job, that I would still be a digital nomad and never come into the office and I would be eligible for 401k matching and the company's health insurance when I came home. So I said yes and I've been doing the job for about half a year. It's been as advertised, I set aside an hour or so a night on my laptop in front of the TV and it hasn't grown into anything bigger yet. The salary is a small, small fraction of what I used to make but it's worth my time. We'll see how things stand after another year.

**Year 2 update - I was stuck at home during COVID lockdown.**

https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/gwhxgh/2_year_update_38msingle_23_million_submitted_my/

>My net worth skyrocketed to over $3 million thanks to the post-China trade deal rally and the market assuming COVID-19 is contained. The abrupt, panicked selloff as the world went into lockdown knocked me back down to $2.1 million. Painful, but I rode the Great Recession all the way down and back ten years ago, so I had that experience to rely on to resist panic selling. I've since rode the April/May rally back up to $2.6 million. https://i.imgur.com/Wg7c74L.jpg

**Year 3 update - I didn't post an update because we were still in lockdown. Couldn't fly anywhere.**

>I did a lot of camping trips at state parks in Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico and Arkansas. It was nice. Lots of exploring in towns like Taos and Durant and Turkey. Spent a lot of time with family.

**Year 4 update - Lockdown over. I accepted a volunteer position in New York City.**

https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/ydg6b5/4_year_update_38msingle_23_million_submitted_my/

>I went to a friend's wedding in New York City and I had such a great time that I later signed on as an unpaid volunteer with NY Cares. I'm currently based in Queens and I'll be here into December helping high schoolers and their Mandarin or Spanish-speaking families fill out their FAFSA applications. Enjoying myself very much. I'm basically a tourist all day and night.
My net worth ... I've been on a wild ass ride since 2018 that has been bewildering and head-spinning. $2.3 million at retirement, rallied to above $3 million at the pre-COVID peak. The lockdown selloff was brutal, I was back to $2.1 million pretty quickly by summer 2020. I then put my hoarded cash to work in more big bank, tech names and leveraged ETF plays hoping to claw back to over $3 million within three years. I was floored that it ballooned to over $10 million on the backs of those leveraged bank and tech plays going parabolic and leading the market as the Federal Reserve kept interest rates near zero (thanks ""transient inflation"") and QE going for substantially longer than anyone expected. https://i.imgur.com/eJbG1Vx.jpeg
Well, that's all crashed and burned in 2022. The steady 75-basis point interest hikes beginning in the spring by the Fed to kill the +8% inflation we are enduring have torpedoed the bank and tech names in my portfolio. I'm currently at about $6.1 million, a $4 million loss from the peak. Yes, it has been exceptionally painful. I've done some selling on the rallies and other selling on stop-loss orders being triggered. https://i.imgur.com/EjmMPz9.jpg
But, whatever. I knew these trades I entered into in 2020 were high risk, high reward. And I'm up over 100% on my net worth since I retired four years ago. If you would have told me then that my nest egg would balloon to over $6 million within five years, I would have done backflips.

**Year 5 update - I spent several months camping/living the slow life in the desert near Big Bend, then spent several more months in China.**

>So I was in Beijing for a wedding and then wandered the countryside for a bit with my expat friends in the country. It was lovely. Favorite place was the city of Harbin in the Heilongjiang province in the far northeast corner of China. If you superimposed a map of China onto the US, Harbin would roughly be where Vermont is. So it's cold and close to the Russian border. Lots of Russian looking Chinese people there and lots of families observing both cultures, it was cool and interesting. Lots of expat Russians there hiding from the Ukraine war. Cool locals. Spectacular cold weather food, lots of great pork stews and orange chicken. I think I ate pork belly braised in soy sauce served over white rice at least 20 times. Highly recommend Heilongjiang, it's not nearly as touristy as other places in China.
The rest of the year has been a bit aimless, I think I'm running out of ideas for things to do ...
Net worth today - I'm at $6.9 million as of 9/20/23. So about a 13% gain since last year's update. https://i.imgur.com/vImOLpx.jpg

**Today. Year 6 update - I stopped travelling and stayed home to focus on my fitness and mental health. Then I moved on a whim to a different state that I have no connection to**

Travelling nonstop was starting to feel like a chore, so I just stayed home in Texas for several months. I was running out of ideas for places that really excited me to go see. So I spent time with my elderly parents and I really buckled down on my workouts and eating more whole foods and non-red meat protein. Lots of daily jogs and long walks. Lots of volunteer work on my feet. I lost about 25 pounds. I joined a gym for a little while and hated it, I now just swing and squat kettlebells in my garage all the time.

I used to be very unhealthy in my 20s and 30s when I was working full time, didn't get enough sleep or drink enough water, ate too much junk, and so forth. And going as hard as I did to build wealth under those circumstances just made me miserable, I didn't fully grasp just how miserable I made myself until now when all the pressure is off. Best thing for me about FIRE now is being able to afford eating and living clean and being able to see a doctor or specialist whenever I want or need to. 

I then moved out of state on a whim to Tulsa, Oklahoma. My city in Texas has become very crowded since everyone decided to move here post-COVID. The traffic has gotten a lot worse and the lines for everything has people on an edge all the time and the whole scene was not vibing with me trying to be healthier in mind and body. I didn't sell my home and I plan on going back to Texas after a year or so, still love it. I just needed a break from that place.

Why Tulsa? First, because I've always liked Tulsa a lot. Have travelled here for work for years. Tulsa is basically a mini-Austin and Oklahoma City is a mini-Fort Worth, both minus all the overcrowding and overpriced housing. Really nice art and music scenes here, plus very close to mountains and forests in Arkansas and Missouri to the east. Tulsa itself is very clean and the civic pride is evident, the Arkansas River area south of downtown is fixed up nice with miles of walkways and well-cared for parklands and downtown itself is full of renovated art deco buildings that are filling up with lots of tech and finance workers. Crime in Tulsa is a bit of a problem, but it's a problem where I'm coming from and that didn't scare me.

Second reason, the city is paying me $10,000 in grants to live here for a year as a work-from-home person from out of state. Click on https://www.tulsaremote.com/ for more information. I'm currently living in a really nice loft downtown in a renovated red-bricked warehouse building. I'm a short walk from the really nice central library and several nice restaurants and am surrounded by several apartment and condo buildings for professionals. A little under 700sf, one bedroom for $1,020/month. The grant covers almost all of it and my other costs are noticeably cheaper than in Texas, so I'm basically living here for free. The high temperature forecast this week is 87 degrees, while the high temperature at my house in Texas is 105. It's more than a fair deal.

I'm still travelling, was in Jacksonville the other week for a few rocket launches. Headed to NYC for a few days next week. When travelling via car, I'm going to rural Arkansas and Missouri a lot. Lots of really nice state parks, I'm camping and hiking a lot. Eureka Springs in Arkansas is amazing, I highly recommend it if you are into rustic towns in the forest with old winding main streets and hot springs. I plan on returning to NYC in November to jog the marathon, then go home when my grant money runs out here. Who knows after that.

My net worth ... have reclaimed the $10 million mark this month.

Global markets have rallied big the past 12 months due to end of the rate hike cycle and the AI frenzy. I've engaged in zero trades this year, I've just held onto my core index funds and my leveraged tech and bank names. Not because I knew this would happen, but because I'm growing a tired of managing my own stock portfolio and was happy doing nothing.

financialindependence,how much to save,"Found out my partner has a negative net worth. Basically no savings, some CC debt, and student loans they are currently not paying. Anyone else been in a similar situation? How did you handle it?","I've (34) been dating someone (32) for about a year and a half now. You may say that's a long time to not know about someone's financial situation, but we have taken things very slow and started off casual.

I've had FIRE as a goal for many years now and have been lucky to have a high salary and high rate of savings. My net worth is around $900K. Nothing crazy, but I understand it's way ahead of most my age.

I've always told myself I was going to find a partner who makes achieving FIRE easier, or at least not harder. A teammate who I could set a combined goal with and work towards it together. I don't think I want kids, so they are not really a factor here.

I've never directly asked my partner how much money they have saved, or how much they make, or anything like that. I know they do keep a budget for themselves, which is great. I know they are currently living within their means, which is also good. They make a decent salary but it really only allows them to live paycheck-to-paycheck right now since life in the city we live in is so expensive. They are actively looking for new work, hopefully higher paying, so that's good too.

Over the past few months I've come to realize they have some CC debt (I think it's a few thousand and has been transferred to a zero interest card), have not been paying their student loans (I'm not sure how much is left to pay off), and has maybe a couple thousand dollars in a 401k (not sure if they are currently contributing but I think so).

Meanwhile they went on a long vacation to Europe last year, are going to South America this year. They have a dog. Live alone. Things I would normally view as luxuries only to be had once you've got the basics covered. But maybe I need to get a grip and realize they are just trying to live a decent life.

Now obviously they are not my spouse yet, but I'm starting to think about the ""what if's"" if we were to take the next steps. Would I be ok with these things? Am I going to be ok sharing my money with them?

I've never told them how much money I have saved, I've never told them about my goal of being financial independent and retiring early. I'm a bit afraid to do so. I certainly do not think they are the type of person who would view me as some soft of ""golden ticket"" or anything, they are an independent person and I do like that about them. But I do think they would be pretty thrilled to hear about my money in a way that might feel not great.

I don't know, now I'm just rambling. But I'm wondering what this subs take is on my situation and would love to hear from others who may have been in similar situations to me and how things went, how you viewed it, and all that.

I fully understand there is SO much more to a person than their money or earnings potential, don't get me wrong. But at the same time money is very important and does dictate that kind of life you can lead.

financialindependence,how much to save,Are you delaying Social Security till 70?,"According to the NYTimes today, ""People get just 70 percent of their full Social Security benefit if they claim at 62, the full benefit at 67 and 124 percent of the benefit if they claim at 70.  A 2022 study said that more than 90 percent should wait till age 70, yet only 10 percent appeared to do so.""

I figure this community would be in the 10% waiting till 70, but instead of assuming I'll ask:

Are you all delaying or planning on delaying SS till 70?  If not, any reason why not, that you would care to share. 

Edit:  Thank you so much to everyone who replied, I read through most of the replies and learnt so much about SS.  As someone not close to SS, I just assumed everyone in this community would take SS at 70, based on the math and their savings.  I am glad I asked, so I know now, how wrong I was in that assumption.  Sounds like the age of taking SS depends on health, marriage, the difference in income and age for folks who are married, resources you already have and probably a ton of things that I am forgetting to mention here.",237,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1gpwfcz/are_you_delaying_social_security_till_70/,1731447905.0,azfanboy,1gpwfcz,advice_seeking
financialindependence,how much to save,Cancer and FIRE,"I've been working on FIRE for over a decade now.  This year, my toddler was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer.  The treatment is incredibly intense and awful.  My wife has become a full time caregiver, basically living at the hospital for weeks at a time with only short breaks at home.  And so I've become basically a single dad to my other two kids.  It's been awful and hard and heartbreaking every step of the way.  I am lucky to have extremely good healthcare from my job, and a flexible boss who has been willing to tolerate me being a much worse worker during the 18 months best case of treatments that are expected.  I've even been able to take intermittent leave with paid FMLA.  I'm so so grateful to my company.

With everything else going on in the world right now, everything has been feeling super unstable.  Tariffs, ICE roundups, wildfires, dollar depreciation.  My brain has felt broken at times, and I've made some stupid mistakes (gas pedal instead of brake pedal while parking, for instance!).  I have nightmares every night.  But I'm hanging in there, I'm going to be ok.

Because of FIRE, one thing I haven't had to worry about much is money.  If you're on the fence about whether you should pursue FIRE, this has really really helped. 

But here's where I need advice.  I had been getting pretty close to FIRE before all this started.  Right now, my FIRE income is 140k with the 4% rule, and I was aiming for $150k (family of 5, current expenses between $80-$100k but expecting health care costs and wanting to travel more).  (This estimate included health care costs before the news that ACA costs will be going up 75%!). I know that expense range is rather large but it's what I've actually spent the last few years and fluctuates with house repairs and such.  I had also wanted to aim for a 3.5% rather than 4%.  But.  But!  I could maybe retire now with some belt tightening.  And that would let me spend time with my daughter (that I might not get the chance to otherwise, she only has a 50% survival chance although she's responding well to treatment).  And deal with being a single dad.  And make space for self care that's often not been happening this year. 

I worry though that I'm a remote worker, my industry (software) is consolidating and laying off people, and I might never get the chance again to make as much money as I make now.  That means I'll have a harder time if this way more risky than expected retirement goes south.  And I will have to support my family - if my daughter survives, she'll need life long medical care because of all the treatments.  And I have no idea if I can get a decent health care plan with the ACA, whether it'll still be affordable after Trump, and how much it would eat into my savings now with these super intensive treatments.  And I don't have the mental space to deal with a lot more uncertainty.  I never expected this but it just feels like my brain is overwhelmed all the time now.

Because of all this, I'm inclined to keep working.  But I can't really trust myself right now, and I usually plan everything out to the last detail before doing anything, and I don't have time or headspace for that.  What would you do?

financialindependence,savings rate,The acceleration of AI is making me really glad I went hard on FIRE,"I'm a software developer in my early 40's.  I have ~ 20 years of experience in the field.  I've worked my entire career in the south east, never for FAANG and it wasn't until about a decade in that I even crossed six figure comp.  I've gotten where I am in my FIRE journey by the sheer force of a *very* high savings rate.  I basically never stopped living like a glorified grad student.

Given I always planned for the worst and the worst never happened, I'd kind of felt like I overshot the effort needed to get where I wanted to be, and I kind of regretted going at it as hard as I did when I could have taken a more relaxed approach and enjoyed myself a little more along the way.

The rapid pace of change in AI has changed that though.  I'm not one of those 'singularians' breathlessly claiming we'll see AGI by 2027, but I've noticed that even AI skeptics have *dramatically* moved forward the timelines when they expect AI to have major effects on the labor market.  I'm planning to retire in 4 years, I've been FI for about 5 now, and I'm finding myself **really** grateful I went as hard as I did.  Not only does FIRE insulate one from disruptions in the labor market, but if we *do* see massive productivity benefits, those will mainly flow to investors in the form of higher returns, at least until the current economic system changes.  I sleep much better having taken the FIRE path than if I'd let lifestyle inflation keep me living pay check to pay check, or planned to retire at 65.",1263,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1l5r0l3/the_acceleration_of_ai_is_making_me_really_glad_i/,1749319217.0,alpacaMyToothbrush,1l5r0l3,not_advice_seeking

**A Few Updates & Observations Since We Hit $1 Million 3 Years Ago:**

* A few months after hitting our $1 million milestone in 2021, we bought a house in the suburbs and moved out of our small condo in the city. Did a pretty massive whole-house renovation. Our expenses have gone up significantly, but man, we love it here. Best decision we've ever made. 
* We kept the condo as a rental property for 3 years and recently sold it. It was solidly cash flow positive and we had a great tenant in it the entire time, but still not worth the hassle IMO. Sold it for a nice profit once our tenant moved out.
* Weird seeing our investments go down significantly in 2022 due to the stock market downturn. Net worth still managed to stay flat due to aggressive savings and home appreciation.
* In hindsight, buying our ""forever"" home in 2021 with a 4% interest rate has been an OP cheat code. Home appreciation has been an unexpected tailwind for our net worth.
* Stock market in 2023 was crazy. Stock market in 2024 has been bonkers. I genuinely don't understand how it works. Doesn't make sense.
* Had a baby earlier this year. She's the freaking best. Having kids once you are financially, emotionally, and mentally ready is amazing. Highly recommend.
* After baby arrived, wife quit her great six figure job to be a stay-at-home mom. Another one of the best decisions we've ever made. Happiness > Money.
* The decisions that we've made over the last 10 years have set us up so well. We now have the luxury to step back from our careers and focus on our family, which was our plan all along. 

Feel free to ask me any questions you may have about our life or FIRE journey.

financialindependence,savings rate,Year 2: 80% Savings Rate in HCOL -- Spending Breakdown,"[Year 1 Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/18vbunr/80_savings_rate_in_hcol_spending_breakdown/)

Second year of these updates, second year of not actually reaching 80%. 78.0% this year. 

**TLDR**; 27M. Made more ($139.0k net) and spent more ($30.6k) than last year; some money was very well spent, some was not. Still tuning spending to maximize utility of each dollar spent (as much as reasonably possible). See Sankey diagram below for where my money comes from and goes. In 2025 income will continue to increase, so I’m working on reducing the weighting of “cost” in my everyday decision making so I can continue to try new things and do more of what I really enjoy.

[2024 Sankey](https://imgur.com/a/iu68HAU)

I hope everyone had a good year. I enjoy seeing spending breakdowns from others so again sharing my expense details, how I saved (close to) 80% of my take-home pay in a HCOL city (COL index of 140-150), and of course reflections heading into the new year.

**Savings Rate**

To calculate savings I use: 1- \[expenses / {take home pay + 401k + HSA + 401k match}\]. If you're looking at my 2024 Sankey it's (Savings/\[Savings+Expenses\]) or in plain English ""how much I keep of all the money that enters my accounts"".

**Income**

Income was a bit different this year as I started a contractor position and formed an S-corp. Gross income was $172k (vs. $145k last year), putting me in the [98th percentile in the US for my age](https://dqydj.com/income-percentile-by-age-calculator/), though I now have 0 benefits. More comparable net income was $139k this year vs. $117k last year, an 18% increase. Landing the new role (moved from management consulting to private equity) was a surprise at every stage of the way, from their outreach all the way up to the offer. Planning to stay as long as they’ll have me as income will continue to increase.

I know I said last year that gross would be $250k, but $65k of my compensation this year is deferred until February. This is already earned and guaranteed payment, so I wasn’t sure whether to include it but I only like to count chickens that have hatched. 

Other income for the year totaled $7k, mostly between tax returns and credit card point redemptions.

I think these communities generally focus on cutting expenses since everybody has similar types of expenses (housing, transportation, food, etc.) and similar strategies can work to reduce them, whereas advice for increasing income must be tailored to a person’s skill set, affinities, and career path. Making more money certainly makes it a lot easier to save though; there is only so much you can cut.

**Expenses**

Expenses totaled $30,593 for the year, a 26% increase over 2023. 31% of spend this year was housing (rent, utilities, and internet), 24% was vacation, and 19% was food (groceries, restaurants, and alcohol & bars); every other category was <10% of total spend.

The biggest difference makers for my (relatively) low spend are the typical budget’s largest categories: housing, transportation, and food. For 9 months this year there were still four people sharing our 3bd home, and the last 3 months we had one new roommate replace the shared bedroom. It got a little crowded at points, but we were four very good friends so I actually miss it now that there’s only three here. I enjoy the forced socialization that having roommates entails and I’ve been fortunate to avoid any nightmare roommate scenarios.

Transportation is very low as I work from home and don’t need a car, still going pretty much everywhere I need to on foot, bike, bus, or train. Rented a car a few times this year for trips, and that has been significantly cheaper than buying, registering, and insuring a car that will not move from its parking spot 95% of days. I considered purchasing several times this year, but every time I did the math it just didn’t make sense to own a car.

Food is low as I clip coupons and shop deals at the grocery store, rarely drink alcohol, and probably eat out once per week on average. At restaurants the bill becomes significantly cheaper if you’re not drinking, so my restaurant spend is significantly lower than the same friends that I’m frequently going out with. Interestingly my restaurant spend each of the last four years has still been higher than my grocery spend, but I think this says more about how inexpensive the groceries I buy are than it does about how much I’m eating out.

**Reflections**

I spent more on vacations (+179%, +$4,779), insurance (+116%, +$1,304), gifts (+124%, +$694), personal care (+1,150%, +$692), food (+18%, +$902), entertainment (+97%, +$651), transportation (+28%, +$167), and shopping (+1%, +$9) this year vs. 2023. AKA just about every category I track. 

I spent less on housing (-16%, -$1,766).

I wanted to make changes this year to enjoy my money more and it looks like I did. I took my first international trip with my girlfriend and went on another trip with my whole family \[vacation\], joined a gym and put on 20lbs of (mostly) muscle \[personal care\], said yes to more fun opportunities \[entertainment\], and treated friends and family to events and meaningful presents \[gifts\]. All things I’m glad I spent on and plan to continue spending on.

Not every individual expense within each category was a winner, but on the whole I’m happy with where more of my money is going. The only category increases that I’m not happy with were insurance and shopping, though the insurance increase was purely driven by my contractor status. I am already on the cheapest plan available to me that fits my needs. The shopping increase was negligible.

This year was the first that I could not have survived on minimum wage in my city, so I am certainly enjoying some luxuries that I have not in the past.

**Changes for 2025**

Spending changes don’t feel as pressing as they did last year and I want to mostly do more of the same, continuing to spend more on vacation, entertainment, personal care, and gifts. I already have a southeast Asia trip planned for the early part of the year. 

Income will actually be increasing significantly in 2025 (I know I said it last year too…). Including equity grants and my deferred compensation paid in February, my total compensation should be around $260k-$280k gross in 2025, which feels ridiculous to type. At this point the marginal dollar saved each year isn’t doing much, so I’m trying to make daily decisions without worrying about making $10 mistakes so long as I continue to avoid $10,000 mistakes.

Congrats if you made it this far, I hope this was as informative for you to read as it was for me to write. Hoping everybody has an incredible 2025 and grateful for all the stories and insights I get to read being part of these communities!

**Net Worth**

I’d prefer to focus on income and expenses, but it feels incomplete to leave out net worth. Current net worth is $472k, up from $331k end of last year and -$17k 5.5 years ago (start of career).",27,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1hqihu6/year_2_80_savings_rate_in_hcol_spending_breakdown/,1735663211.0,col02144,1hqihu6,not_advice_seeking

financialindependence,savings rate,Post-FIRE 3yr Update: 37F SINK former accountant,"**TL DR:** FIREd in May 2022 with $885k, current NW is $1.1M. Last year's expenses totaled $34k. NW peaked at $1.2M in Feb, watching it drop $100k in two months has been slightly unsettling. Life wise, I've been in Japan since last April attending a language school. This has been a great way to experience what life is like in Japan, challenge my brain, and socialize with locals and foreigners. Once my visa ends in June, I’ll visit my family in the US and then travel to China and SE Asia next. All is well; I'm still FIREd, happy and thriving.

**Background:** [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/137vg2p/35f_sink_nw_900k_former_accountant_post_fire_1st/) is the link to my first year update. 2nd Year is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1chjz7j/fired_36f_sink_2nd_year_update/)

**Life Update:** I’ve been living in Tokyo on a student visa through a Japanese language school since last April. Classes are held 3 hours a day five days a week. I lucked out and had afternoon classes from 1pm to 4pm. I like to start my mornings slowly so this schedule was ideal. I typically wake up between 9 to 10am, maybe workout and have lunch before going to class. Attending classes gave structure to my days while also opening doors to social connections and deeper cultural experiences.

Living in Japan has been a lifelong dream of mine. I first experienced it during a study abroad semester over a decade ago, and ever since then, I've wanted to come back to spend a year or more improving my Japanese and experiencing what normal life is like here year round. FIRE has finally made this possible, and it's been everything I hoped for - from the fresh spring cherry blossoms to the vibrant autumn leaves.

 My Japanese has progressed from just being able to order food to now having basic conversations with shopkeepers and locals. I was able to pass the Japanese Language Proficiency Test Level N2 last December. There's something deeply satisfying about that progress. Oh, in between classes I also managed to summit Mt. Fuji, the highest mountain in Japan. Checking 'climb an iconic active volcano' off my bucket list feels pretty sweet. #HumbleBrag

Living in Tokyo has been surprisingly comfortable. I’m renting a bedroom in a decent sharehouse about 15 minutes from my school by foot. It's small by American standards but has everything I need and feels quite cozy. The neighborhood has plenty of affordable restaurants, convenience stores, and is close to a nice park where I sometimes read or people-watch. Living close to school not only helps me save on the ticket fare, it also saves me from rush hour commute. I can’t stand being packed into a train car like sardines in a can.

**Finances:** I FIREd in May 2022 with $885k. Current NW is around $1.1M. My asset allocation is approximately 55% VGT, 40% VTSAX and 5% cash. Although my NW peaked at $1.2M in Feb, watching it drop $100k due to market volatility has been wild. There was a dopamine hit each time my NW climbed up last year. Given the recent downturn, I’ve stopped checking it as often. I mean there’s no good reason to intentionally make oneself unhappy, right?

This is exactly why I built a couple years of cash cushion before pulling the trigger on FIRE - to weather sequence of returns risk without panicking. Since pulling the plug in 2022, I haven’t had to withdraw from my stock portfolio because I was cash heavy from selling my house initially. Then, early last year I sold my car for $10k. This past year, I’m happy to say that the $35k I had loaned to a relative was fully repaid back to me. It was really fortunate that this personal loan worked out in the end, and I got my money back without any issues. So after all that, I currently have $50k cash left which hopefully should cover me until the markets recover a bit.

2024 expenses totaled $34k. The biggest expenses were $6k language school tuition, $6k rent annually, and $8k was spent paying for a two-week vacation in Japan for my mom. My mom wanted to see Tokyo, Mt. Fuji and cherry blossoms so I was happily able to fulfill her dream by treating her to an all expenses paid vacation. Seeing her joy while experiencing Japan made every yen worth it.

 Food and public transportation in Japan are fairly cheap. A typical meal costs less than $10, and the quality and level of service is by far better than the US. Due to the weak yen and strong dollar exchange rates, it feels like everything in Japan is 30% off. (100 yen was about $1 pre-Covid, but it’s now around 140 yen to $1) My guilty pleasures are splurging on massages and tennis lessons a few times each month.

**Plans for the near future:** After my visa ends in June, I will head back to the US to visit my family and then continue to slowly travel around China and SE Asia. I am aiming to spend a few weeks to months in each place. I'm looking to find affordable apartments through Airbnb or local platforms. The cost of living in these areas should allow me to stay comfortably under my budget while experiencing new cultures and cuisines.

**Some Random thoughts and Lessons Learned:**

* I simplify my post FIRE life by focusing on doing something physical, something mental, and something social each day.

* Make sure to cultivate frugal hobbies such as sports, gardening, cooking, hiking or board games. When I get bored I often sign up for a Meetup event, visit the community gym for a swim, weight training, or go out for a hike.

* Slow travel is not only more affordable but infinitely more rewarding than rushing from place to place.

* Don't sacrifice all your comforts - my splurges on massages, tennis lessons and occasional nice meals keep me happy without wrecking my budget.

* Having a purpose beyond just ""not working"" makes FIRE so much more fulfilling. For me, it's language learning, cultural exploration, and sharing experiences with others.

* Market volatility is much easier to handle when you've planned for it and have cash reserves. The countless FIRE reddit discussions and PF blog posts about SORR weren't just theoretical; they've proven invaluable in helping me navigate this market downturn with confidence.

Thanks for reading this update. I'm always happy to share more specific details about life in Japan, FIRE calculations, or travel planning if anyone's interested.

financialindependence,build emergency fund,"Didn’t grow up with money, but I’m slowly building a future I didn’t think was possible","I just wanted to share something that might resonate with others who didn’t come from wealth or financial literacy.

I grew up in a household where money was always tight, and debt was just part of life. Saving? Investing? Those were things ""rich people"" did. I didn’t know anything about credit scores, interest rates, or even basic budgeting until my mid-20s.

A couple years ago, I stumbled across this sub, and it honestly shifted my perspective. I started tracking my expenses, paying down high-interest debt, and saving — even if it was just $50 a month. Eventually, I opened a Roth IRA and started putting small amounts into index funds. It wasn’t a big leap, just slow, steady steps.

Now I’m at a place where I finally have an emergency fund, I’m investing regularly, and I’m not afraid to look at my bank account. It’s still a work in progress, and I’m nowhere near FIRE yet, but I finally feel like I’m building something.

financialindependence,build emergency fund,"WSJ Profiles a Family Drowning in Lifestyle Creep—FI Community, Brace Yourself","The Wall Street Journal just dropped a classic rage-bait piece for anyone in the FI community:
“A Couple Wants to Cut Debt—and Save for Retirement. Can They Do Both?”
Link (paywalled): https://www.wsj.com/personal-finance/cut-debt-save-retirement-financial-advice-fa397289?st=uf8HY2&reflink=article_copyURL_share

It profiles a family of three in NJ (40M, 40F, 10M) with the following finances:

HHI: $180K

Debt:
* $14K on 3 credit cards (mostly at 0%)
* $15K personal loan at 6.8%
* $340K left on mortgage at 4.125%
* $45K across two car loans, up to 7.6% interest

Monthly expenses: ~$8,000 total
* Mortgage: $1,850
* Property taxes: $1,100
* Car payments: $1,000
* Groceries: $1,600 (!?)
* Phones/utilities: $600
* Car insurance/gas/tolls: $450

* 403(b): $17K (contributing 5%)
* NJ teacher pension: $360/paycheck
* 12K in short-term savings, $0 emergency fund
* $33K in 529 plan

The advice from a financial planner interviewed for the article? Cut back on retirement contributions to pay down the debt. 🤦‍♂️

My take: They’re living well beyond their means and are seriously behind on retirement.

What they should actually do:

* Sell the cars and get two used vehicles—cash. Even modest used cars would cut their monthly nut by hundreds.
* Groceries at $1,600/month for 3 people is absolutely wild. Unless they’re importing wagyu and saffron, this can be slashed to $600–$700.
* Sounds like they put the kid in one of those travel sports leagues. I would pull him out and switch to a cheaper local rec league. Emotionally tough, yes—but if they’re in a financial hole, this is the kind of stuff you pause, not prioritize.

With just these three changes, they could free up $2,250/month, which should go straight toward high-interest debt. Once the debt is paid down, that $2,250/month should build up their emergency fund (they need like $40k for that). Once that's done, then it should be used for supercharging their retirement savings.

It’s not a hopeless situation, but this is what lifestyle creep looks like.

financialindependence,build emergency fund,Brokerage vs. Tax-Advantaged Accounts for FIRE,"I’ve been saving heavily for retirement for about 7 years after reading the personalfinance flowchart and advice in this sub, and wanted to check in.

I’m 31M, TC is ~160k a year, and account values are as follows:

- 401k: $355k

- Roth: $53k

- HSA: $8k

- Brokerage: $22k

- Emergency Fund: $18.5k

- Joint Accounts with my wife (wedding, honeymoon, house savings): $60k

My company has an excellent match - 100% on up to $15k in 401k contributions every year, so I always hit that, and usually contribute up until I hit the full federal maximum for 401k. My wife and I file jointly, but we contribute pre-tax to our 401k to reduce our MAGI so that we can be eligible for the full Roth amount; next, I prioritize that, and lastly, I always max out my HSA. Maxing all of these accounts means my current taxable brokerage contributions are at $100/week.

My question is - I met with a Fidelity advisor while my company was offering appointments, and let him know early retirement is a goal of mine. He recommended building up a larger taxable brokerage to have accessible cash in my 50s - for healthcare, living expenses, etc. He said that having enough cash to cover expenses and avoiding any penalties incurred by withdrawing from retirement accounts before 59.5 is a good strategy. However, this contradicts advice I usually see on Reddit, which is that tax-advantaged accounts should always be prioritized first.

Should I shift focus to my brokerage? Thinking if I adjust 401k contributions to just hit the $15k match, and not the full federal $23.5k max, I’d have more room to contribute. However, since we’re on the edge of the income cutoff for Roth IRAs, this may have the additional drawback of reducing the max we can contribute there.

financialindependence,build emergency fund,Retire at 45? Military Retiree.,"Hello,  
  
I am a 35 y/o male who recently medically retired from the military in 2022, and immediately began a W2 salary job as a consultant working from home making $140k now. I am married to my 34 y/o spouse, and we live in Florida. I am seeking assistance to see if we are ‘on track’ to retire at 45 years old based on the below retirement assets and living expenses we currently maintain.  
  
Emergency funds: $190,000 in HYSA @ 3.75% – we’ve kept a lump sum from a recent home sale and we are saving for a pool install and building out a separate structure/mother-in-law suite on our primary property.  
  
Pensions (both tax free and inflation adjusted):

* VA Disability: $50k annually Combat Specialty Pay: $13k annually

Debt: $675k remaining on mortgage. House is worth about 850k.  
  
Tax Filing Status: MFJ  
  
Tax Rate: 24% federal rate; State: 0%  
  
Current Salary: $140k (W2 salary)  
  
Current Spouse Salary: $50k (non-profit small business)  
  
State of Residence: Florida

Desired Asset allocation: Primarily stocks (Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Admiral Shares/S&P 500 Index tracked)  
  
Desired International allocation: approximately 5% of holdings are Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund Admiral Shares  
  
Insurance:

* $800k term life insurance policy for myself I also pay into the military’s Survivor Benefit Program (annuity) for my wife, which would entitle her to half of my retirement income for life – this is also inflation adjusted. The estimate to date is $2,500/mo if I kick the bucket today. Health Insurance: Military Retiree through TRICARE for myself and spouse; family premiums are $365 for the year.

Annual Savings: $20k (7k into Vanguard Roth IRA; $13k into Employer Roth 401k)  
  
Total Investment Portfolio: **$447k**  


* **$30k** Traditional 401k Thrift Savings Plan (held in C & S funds – tracks S&P equivalent from what I know) 
* **$70k** New Employer Vanguard Roth 401k in VFFSX - Instl 500 Index Trust $35k Vanguard taxable brokerage account in VTSAX - Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Admiral Shares 
* **$311k** Roth IRA - $280k in Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Admiral Shares (VTSAX); $30K in Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund Admiral Shares (VTIAX); 
* **$1k** in Vanguard Total Bond Index ETF (BND)

Questions:  


* 1.) Based on forecasting tools, we are estimated to accrue $2.1-2.7M in assets by age 45. Based on annual expenses of $100k (approximately), is this feasible to retire early and begin pulling funds? 
* 2.) If so, should I be shifting more funds into a taxable brokerage to ‘bridge the gap’ of being able to pull retirement funds once we hit 45 years old? If so, how should those taxable funds be allocated based on age?  
* 3.) Are there any other changes needed at this time?  
* 4.) Knowing myself well, I will likely get a part-time gig for $30-50k doing something fun here on the beach, at a golf course, restaurant in the area, etc. to keep myself sane.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1lp25pr/retire_at_45_military_retiree/,1751377744.0,kraguefromprague,1lp25pr,advice_seeking

I started my FI journey when I stumbled onto this sub almost 10 years ago while waiting for the all clear during a mortar attack in Afghanistan (yea there was WIFI). Back then, I was less than a year into my military career, dealing with my first paychecks, first apartment, and first real bills. I was looking for direction to start building my life after I got back and this sub provided the direction and knowledge I needed, right when I needed it most.

 
Wanted to post my first milestone post after finding this sub about a decade ago. I’ve always found these posts helpful, and I owe a lot of my knowledge and direction to this community. TBH, the last few months have been a challenge financially and I’m feeling pretty down despite the milestone (which I’ll get into later) so I’m looking for advice, guidance, and above all perspective.


###Here's where I stand:    
Current retirement savings rate: 20%.     
Lifetime retirement savings rate: 17% (Its fluctuated between 8-27% over the years I’ve been tracking it).    
###Assets.   
HYSA E Fund - $30K.   
Checking- $5K.   
TSP (401K) - $290K (mostly Roth contributions over the last 10 yrs, but recently switched to Traditional) 60% C, 25% S, 15% G Fund.    
2x ROTH IRA - $94K (a mix of index funds & individual stocks).    
Simple IRA - $4K.    
Rollover IRA - $5K.    
Taxable Brokerage - $90K (this was a windfall my parents gave me when I joined the military. My parents had saved some money for college, and since I paid for college through the military, they gave me money to help get me started. I’ve dipped into it a few times to pay down debts and purchase my home, but have never let the balance go below the original amount I received.      
Crypto - $20K (mostly COVID stimulus checks with some additional contributions).     
Asset Total - $538K.    
###Debts –     
Car Loan - $12K (3%).   
Home Repair Loan – $13K (0% until pay off).    
###House.   
Bought in 2021 at 2.75% (0% down) when I moved to a new duty location. ~$50K in equity. I’ve put about $50K in repairs into the place since I bought it. I’ll be moving to a new duty location this summer, and I think I’m going to sell it to break even.

 
I think I could rent it for just above expenses (PITI, PM, Vacancy etc.) but after all the repairs that have gone into it, it feels like throwing good money after bad. With all the repairs, we haven’t been able to put any polish on the house and it doesn’t strike me rentable. Thoughts?


###Goals.   
- Ultimately, my goal is more FI than RE. I fully expect to have a second career if I make it to retirement with a pension in 9 years. I’d just like the freedom to choose my career based on interest rather than salary and benefits.

 
- According to my spreadsheet, my current contributions (maxing TSP & 2x Roths - $3500/mo) would get me to $1.5mil in 9 years at a 6% growth rate. Coupled with the potential military pension ($50k/yr), I’d have around $100K in income by the time I leave the military if I were to completely stop working.

 
- My calculations also tell me that if I were to stop contributing altogether my retirement assets would grow to about $3.5mil (true FIRE number) by the time I hit 65, which is a major relief to have hit that milestone. Kids may be on the horizon, so it’s comforting to know that even if my FIRE timeline changes, at least I’ll be set for an on time retirement.

     
###Lessons –    
- Emergency Fund – I’ve always maintained a 3mo E Fund due to the stability of my job, but this winter told me it’s not enough. At the end of the winter I sold some stocks & crypto to finally pay off my spouse’s student loans (6%). To celebrate, we decided to splurge and book a pricier trip that we could afford, but would drain our non-EF savings. Almost a week later we had a $17K plumbing emergency at the house followed by a $5K car repair. Our E fund functioned as intended, but seeing our buffer go down to less than 1 mo expenses, told me that I was no longer comfortable with that risk tolerance. Coupled with the ongoing government spending cuts, which I expect will eventually lead to downsizing in the military (not meant to be political, just a logical extrapolation used for planning), I think my job is less secure than it used to be so I am planning to boost my E-Fund to 1 year’s expenses. I’ve lowered my retirement contributions by about $1k to get there, along with an expected bonus and proceeds from the house sale this summer.

   
- House - One of my chief frustrations with the military is the inability to build equity in a home when you move every 3-4 years. With the current market & rates, I doubt we’ll be buying again for a while after our experience with this house.


###Advice.     
With all the recent financial dilemmas and some creeping uncertainty about the future of my career, I’m feeling a bit drained and disheartened. Could use some support and perspective from the community. How am I doing?

 
Specific questions –     
- Are my goals realistic and achievable?     
- What are your thoughts on renting the house?    
- I’m about 90% stocks, should I be considering a more conservative bond allocation at this point?    
- Are there any glaring omissions or changes that should be made?",100,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1ivyveu/goals_check_up_500k_at_32_military_slow_and_steady/,1740274971.0,lizref,1ivyveu,advice_seeking
financialindependence,build emergency fund,3 Months to RE (Canada,"[First Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1i4c4d2/6_months_to_re_canada/)

I hadn’t planned to update again until my last day of work. With the current market instability, I figured it was worth adding in another one.

Less than 3 months out now, and it’s starting to feel real!  Official retirement notice has been submitted. I’ve started to inform my customer accounts, and word has started to leak to our competitors.

There was a lot of anxiety in the days around hitting that ‘RESIGN’ button in the HR portal. Now, all I’m feeling is impatience, and excitement for the next chapter. I’m ready to be done!

**Numbers**

44F. Single. No kids. Medium-High COL. Ontario, Canada. No mortgage and no consumer debt. All numbers in CAD.

*Current Assets*

The drop from my last update in January has been entirely manageable.  For reference, the S&P 500 has dropped 6.0% in the same time period.

|**Net Worth**|$1.97m|$1.95m|\-1.0%|
|**Retirement Assets**|$1.30m|$1.28m|\-1.5%|

*Pension Income*

There have been no changes to expected pension income.

|Source|Annual Income|Start Age|
|:-|:-|:-|
|DBPP|$18k|60|
|CPP|\~$10k|TBD (65 at the earliest)|
|OAS|\~$9k|65|

*Current Retirement Asset Allocation*

|Asset Type|% of Retirement Assets|
|:-|:-|
|US Equity|22.6 %|
|Real Estate|21.3%|

|Fixed Income|13.9%|
|Crypto|4.6%|
|Cash|2.6%|
|Emerging Markets|2.2%|
|Bullion|0.7%|

*Portfolio Changes*

Luckily, I had already started de-risking my portfolio late last year. This was a move from 100% equities towards an 80/20 split for my non-real estate holdings. As a result, most of my reallocation happened at the peak before things started to go squirrelly. Accidental market timing for the win! 😁

I’m in the process of selling my rental property, which will mostly be used to boost my cash and fixed income holdings. Any remaining funds will be going into international equity markets. The sale was a pre-planned part of my retirement strategy to manage SORR. The choice to go into international equity rather than the usual all-in-one ETF is a response to the current market conditions.

I also still need to drawdown my crypto holdings by a couple of percentage points. I’m in no rush to do that before retirement though.

**Post-RE Life Plans**

With work stress rapidly decreasing, I've finally had the bandwidth to start actively planning my post-retirement life.

I've already joined one club, and I have a few more in the pipeline. First up will be re-joining my old yoga studio and getting back into a regular practice routine. I'm planning to take one of the mid-week mid-day classes so that I can meet others who are available during business hours! There are a couple more clubs that I'm looking into joining/re-joining a bit further down the road. They serve the dual purpose of being a social outlet and are also physical activities that will help me get back on track with my fitness.

As for fitness, I'm slowly building back into a regular exercise routine. Short-term goal is to work back up to weightlifting 4-5 times per week. My mid-term goal is to walk one of the Camino trails in Spain next year (currently looking at Camino del Norte).

I also have a decent sized list of DIY projects for the house and garden that I've been procrastinating on.

After taking this year off, I'll also be restarting classes for my Master's degree in the fall. I have 2-3 years left until that's done. If the research project goes well, I'm still considering going on to get a PhD after.

Plenty to keep me busy for the next few months!

**FAQ**

*How are people reacting to your retirement?*

The overwhelming response has been positive, with many real-life versions of GFY 😆

The first reaction is generally surprise, followed by asking how old I am. The next question is always if I won the lottery.

I’ve had several people ask for investment advice and have had a few follow-up conversations with people who were genuinely interested in learning more.

There has been no overt negativity yet. I’m personally only telling the people that need to know. It’s always others who bring it up in general conversation. I try to steer the conversation away from my plans and finances. I’m hyperaware of how I’m being perceived right now, and I don’t want to come across as gloating or bragging to people who are living paycheque to paycheque.

*Any second thoughts with the current market conditions?*

I did briefly consider staying on at work a bit longer. Emphasis on ‘briefly.’  Nothing has changed with my employer or my current job situation though. I’m still done and more than ready to go.

*Thoughts on post-retirement part-time or consulting work?*

Two of my largest customer accounts have already opened discussions on some temporary part-time contract work later this year and early next year. Our main competitor has also offered me a full-time job. My current employer is also laying some groundwork for some potential part-time contract work. I expect more offers from other competitors to trickle in once word starts to spread.

I knew I would have opportunities after retirement, but I’m a bit surprised by how quickly the offers have started to roll in.

With the current uncertainty in the markets, I am more open to post-RE work than I was two months ago. I’ve also had time to decompress and de-stress since my last post, so I’m feeling much more willing and able to take on some work early in retirement to manage SORR, if needed.

*Has my withdrawal strategy changed in response to the current market conditions?*

Not really. I’m still planning on variable withdrawals, targeting 5% with guardrails. I don’t see any reason to change that.

Despite the bottom line on my accounts going red, my investment income has actually gone up. Once the proceeds from my rental sale are invested, dividends and interest will fully cover my basic living expenses, which I wasn’t expecting. I’ll only need to dip into the principal to cover my discretionary spend.

The plan has always been to live off my cash holdings for the first year or so of retirement. Partly to give my investments an additional year to grow, but also to give myself time to adjust to living without a regular paycheque.  Given the state of the markets, I’m happy to have that buffer.

I’ll be setting up a biweekly deposit from savings to mirror my paycheque. And I plan to withdraw the dividends and interest from my investment accounts monthly to top up the cash. I expect to reallocate my accounts every 6 months or so.

financialindependence,build emergency fund,Family Advice Needed,"Hey everyone, my wife and I are about to make a big life shift and we’d love some financial wisdom on how best to handle the proceeds from selling our house.

Quick Background:
	•	We’re a married couple in our late 30s with 5 kids.
	•	My wife has homeschooled our children since 2020.
	•	We’ve both felt a pull toward a more nontraditional lifestyle.
	•	We’ve recently left the LDS (Mormon) church, which has opened the door for us to redefine what we want out of life and where we want to live.
	•	After years in Utah, we’re ready for a fresh start and slower pace in the Southeast (dream areas include coastal Alabama, Florida Panhandle, Tennessee, North Georgia, and the Carolinas).

Financial Situation:
	•	We’re selling our home in Utah and expect to net around $400,000 in cash after paying off our mortgage and HELOC.
	•	We have no other debts and maintain a solid emergency fund.
	•	I make around $92,000/year currently as a high school auto teacher, but we’re open to me taking a break or finding remote/flexible work during this transition.

Our 5-Year Plan:
	•	Travel the U.S. full-time in our RV for 1–2 years with our kids while continuing homeschooling.
	•	Eventually settle down and buy or build a home in the Southeast—ideally something affordable with land or RV space.
	•	Possibly invest in a rental property or multi-use property (RV park, small farm, etc.) if the right opportunity arises.
	•	During this time, we’ll be out of the housing market and want the home sale proceeds to work for us, but we want to preserve flexibility and capital.

What We’re Considering:
	•	Putting most of the $400K into a high-yield savings account, money market, or short-term T-bills while we’re in “wait and see” mode.
	•	Possibly putting a portion into index funds (S&P 500) for long-term growth if we don’t need to touch it.
	•	Being ready to move quickly on a real estate deal if the perfect spot shows up in the next 1–3 years.
	•	We’re open to more creative ideas (CD ladders, real estate syndicates, short-term REITs?) but not looking to go too risky with our nest egg.

What We’d Love Your Help With:
	•	What’s the smartest way to preserve and grow this money while keeping it liquid enough for a home purchase in 1–3 years?
	•	Is there a financial strategy that balances accessibility, safety, and at least a bit of return?
	•	Has anyone else taken time out of the market to travel and found a good place to park their cash?

Thanks in advance! We’re trying to build a life that’s rich in experiences, not just equity—and we want to make sure we’re doing it wisely.

financialindependence,saving for retirement,119K salary- should I cut retirement contributions to save for house?,"I’m a 29-year-old making $119k. I’ve recently felt like I can’t make much progress toward saving toward a downpayment for a house. I don’t pay a ton for rent ($1170/mo) and don’t have any debt (paid off car, no student loans). I’m wondering if I’m saving too much toward retirement. Between my employer and my person contributions, I’m saving around 26.7% of my gross pay toward retirement (see breakdown below). I feel like I’m behind on my financial/life goals (one of which is owning a house) and am wondering if it’s prudent to reduce my retirement savings in order to save more aggressively for a downpayment on a house. Appreciate any and all insight!

financialindependence,saving for retirement,I just hit $4M in net worth,"I just hit $4M in net worth.  I don't really have anyone else I would talk to about this so posting here.  I hope this will be an encouragement to others.

I am married and have 4 kids, each of whom is now married and has their own kids.  I have been the sole bread winner of the family since our second was born.  I work in technology and nearing retirement.   Between us and our parents, we got our kids through college with minimal debt, bought some cars, and paid for some weddings.  We have moved 9 times.

The net worth journey was $100K - 1996, $1M - 2012, $2M - 2018, $3M - 2021, $4M - 2024.  The mortgage was first paid off in 2018, and that seemed to unlock a faster pace of growth in net worth.

The asset mix is (in $K):

* $1,920K  401K/IRA
* $347K  Roth 401K/IRA
* $303K  Pension
* $134K  HSA
* 109  Savings
* 35  529 Fund
* 1,044  House
* 109  Non liquid - Cars, Jewelry, Cameras, etc.

Retirement investments are ETFs and mutual funds, pretty much all equities.

I haven't really done anything crazy.  I've got basic knowledge of this stuff.  I don't have any advisor.  I have made plenty of bad financial decisions and had some bad luck along the way, but also had some good luck too.  My tips for what I did are here.

* Live below your means, but don't be a miser either.
* Contribute to your retirement funds consistently.
* Diversify in a mix of good quality funds, no individual stocks.
* The Pension fund has represented my pseudo ""bond"" coverage and everything else is in almost all equities.  I can take it out as an annuity or cash balance.
* Leave everything alone when there is a down year.  With the big dips in 2008 and 2022, I stayed the course and was back to pre dip the year after.
* Get out of debt

financialindependence,saving for retirement,Get Rich Slowly - $0 to $5M in 32 years,"(To clarify the numbers: I'm in my early 50's. I started the FiRe path 32 years ago.)

My last [status update](https://reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1ayb99j/hey_another_million_0_to_4m_in_31_years/), at $4M, was almost exactly a year ago.

Short version of FiRe journey: worker bee got fed up with bullshit, started my own company 26 years ago. It was really hard, but worked out in the end. [Long version is in a comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/7sp5te/comment/dt6qe3n/) from seven years ago.

Savings growth:

* $1M took twenty years from $0 net worth.
* $2M took five years
* $3M took three years
* $4M took three years
* $5M took one year

We hit the $5M last month.

I remember a comment from last update where I predicted that $5M would take at least a couple years, and one redditor in particular was pretty skeptical (""*You’re predicting the market to go up another 25% in less than 2 years after the massive run up we’ve just had? Oh man, i wish i shared your optimism*."")  
  
Yet here we are. Made $1M in a year. That's insane.

Some tidbits to share:

* Wife and I continue to work part time. Earned income between the two of us is a bit over $100K/yr
* We're still putting about half that amount into our I401(k) and Roth IRAs
* 2024 annual spend was $100k - but will be higher in 2025. We're doing some home upgrades that will cost $50k. I hesitate to call it a one-time expense because we have a few more projects that need to be done, too. There's always something, right?
* Which means yes, we are drawing down. I've sold a few of my individual stocks with the goal of being almost all in Index Funds, eventually. I'm spreading out the sales depending on my whims and desire to spread out the capital gains over a few years.
* Youngest kid is now a college graduate, and employed! True empty nest now. We're helping the kids out a bit, but both are pretty much on their own in terms of life/work/money. We've told them, ""You always have us as a safety net.""
* Spouse is going to retire from her part time job this year, probably before summer. This is a big step for us because we'll have to go on the exchange now and pay for our own health insurance. Between the drop in income and the added health insurance expense, the difference is significant. I know we can afford it, easily, but it feels weird to make that leap.
* Me, I'm still working part time doing consulting work. It's low stress. I won't take a job unless it's a perfect fit. I'll continue this for a few more years.
* When I do choose to fully retire and shut down my consulting business, that's when I'll start the Roth conversions. Right now the solo 401(k) is just too lucrative to do anything else.

Sure, there's a recession somewhere in the future. It's inevitable. We'll lose $1M in a year just because a 20% market haircut absolutely can happen.

In the meantime, we continue to take awesome vacations. We both have hobbies that keep us pleasantly busy.

It's interesting looking back at my original posts from years ago. I lusted after $4M and considered that my ""GFY"" goal for full retirement. Yes, I am a cliche of the r/financialindependence guy who hits his number but still won't pull the trigger.

See y'all at $6M. No prediction this time. I have no clue what the market will do next.

financialindependence,50/30/20 rule,Taking an indefinite break,"Hello FI community, first ever Reddit post (been lurking here for a couple years) so not exactly a throwaway account.

Sharing my story in case it’s interesting or spurs some ideas. I don’t have a lot of questions but welcome any feedback, guidance, additional perspectives, etc.

TL;DR: Approaching 40, 3 kids; planning to leave a job I enjoy to take a break; Roughly 5% WR currently with some debatable math. Long post following – I tried to start with the most relevant stuff for the group.

Huge thank you to the experts here who’ve shared so much knowledge, and those who’ve shared their personal experience on the journey. Insights on ACA, college funding, psychological considerations, withdrawal rates, and asset allocation have been incredibly helpful.

**Family and Financial Details:**

M39, have 3 kids aged 7 and younger with my wife (40) in MCOL area.

Wife left the workforce a few years ago; I have a director-level role in large Corp.

Estimate annual expenses (allotting for home repairs at 1% and a small amount for car maintenance) to be about $60k without vacations, $70-80k with. $12k of this is Mortgage Principal which I am inclined to think about as asset rebalancing rather than an actual expense (I know this is an atypical viewpoint).

Base is roughly $170k (spent most of my career below $100k but got a massive raise in 2022). bonuses have been meager lately but hoping for 30-40k this year as company has had a good year.

Expect to take a 3+ month break next year with roughly 1.4M NW (\~1.1M liquid). I’ll have a CD ladder paying out most of monthly expenses and a NQDC plan that will kick in afterwards for several years (planning for about $25k per year but subject to market conditions – this is included in NW estimate above).

We both grew up in working-class families and are fairly frugal – we have a nice home, but otherwise have some aversion to spending a lot of money (I used to believe this was a good thing – now I think it’s probably a mixed bag).

 **Main Problems:**

1. My biggest issue is that I am time-poor. Although I WFH and I manage to squeeze in an hour for exercise several days a week, I typically have only about an hour for me time each evening by which point I’m too mentally exhausted to make great use of it. 

 1a: All of our kids are pretty feral by nature, especially my oldest who’s got severe ADHD. There’s not really any downtime when they’re awake – they’re getting into stuff, fighting, etc. We don’t get a ton of family help, though I am very grateful for the in-laws who live close by. Overall, it feels like every day is a grind and that we’ve got the resources to make it more enjoyable, so it seems silly not to.

While we eat pretty healthy, all the food prep is quick stuff – raw or microwaved veggies, PB&J, yogurt, etc. We’re basically just scrambling to make it through each day and not getting enough sleep.

1b: I don’t have time for my interests, especially socializing with other adults away from screaming kids. I’m not sure how RE will solve the social concern, but at least I can make time for daytime hobbies.

2. I feel like I should spend more time with my kids while I can, and that I will regret it if I don’t. I want to be a great dad, but I am shorter and more distracted with the kids than I would like. This is more of a “should” than a “want” right now but I expect the fun level to improve if other stressors decrease.

3. While my job has a lot of positives, I am ultimately sitting in front screens for 8-9 hours every day, spending my efforts as a cog in the economic wheel. I’m also not sure that WFH is really benefitting my happiness – though after moving I’d have a 40-minute commute each way if we are ever forced to go back, which wouldn’t work with family obligations.

I enjoy the day to day, the problems to solve, the people I work with etc. My only complaint aside from the time commitment is the sitting.

**Solution:**

**Part 1: Sabbatical / Mini-Retirement**

I am planning to take a few months off minimum. I’ll ask about the possibility of unpaid leave but am not counting on it being an option. Plenty of ideas, no firm plans yet but will likely be a mix of traveling, more socializing, and being outdoors.

**Part 2: Transition to Coasting**

I expect I will be doing some amount of work (perhaps volunteering) for at least the next 10 years – though maybe my views will change with the break.

Since we are nearly FI and I don’t need a lot of income, I am hoping that when I return from the break, I find something to do with several of these features, maybe through self-employment or contracting:

1.       Part time – 20 hours max

2.       Seasonal – 3 to 6 months per year working

3.       Involves a decent amount of walking

4.       Provides some “Capital P Purpose” – Doing something that really matters to me

Paradoxically, I am interested in getting more into AI / Machine Learning either as a hobby or future “career”. I’ve got some basic Python skills but spent my career in business and data roles.

**Healthcare:**

I am hoping there are no substantive changes to the ACA / subsidies in the next few years, as my wife has a long-term condition that makes us dependent on good insurance.

With the current rules, I expect to manage income via a combination of Roth Conversions to stay off Medicaid, Taxable Brokerage Withdrawals, and low expenses. If I my post-break work ends up earning too much for max subsidies, I guess that’s a good problem to have!

**College:**

We have some funds in a 529, but am counting on showing a low enough income to qualify for whatever’s available. I paid for my own college and grad school, though I get it’s much more expensive now

**Fears:**

1.  Will we run out of money? Will some catastrophe happen with our health or the economy? Will I become unemployable?

I know these are all just feelings to manage.. Right now, my commitment to the goal outweighs the fear.

2. What if I don’t find what I’m looking for on returning, and I’ve essentially thrown aside this great job? Will I regret it if I’m in a slightly worse role, probably earning less?

I don’t have a great sense for the odds that this comes true. I’d like to think it’s a low probability but it is a consideration.

 3. What if the break fails to help me solve the problems outlined above? Should I have a more solid plan going into it?

 I’m certain that I’ll be more active, but whether the quality of my presence improves with the quantity is something I’ll have to be intentional about. I also don’t know how I’m going to find more time to be with friends but am hopeful that the occasional nights out become less of a burden on my wife if I am taking more of the childcare responsibilities.

4. General anxiety about jumping into the unknown, taking a different path than everyone I know in real life, and just a general fear of “failing” – whatever that means.

In some ways, I think work is the opiate of the masses in American culture. It’d be easier to ignore the existential questions and keep working for money, getting the ego boost of a nice income, job title, etc. even though I know that none of these are “core values” and that they won't solve the dissonance I've been feeling.

**Interests and Ideas:**

Spend the summer traveling around the US – lots of time in national parks, exploring small towns, trying different things with the family.

Maybe we can find a house for the summer near a beach and I can become a passable surfer.

Perhaps I’ll dedicate a few hours a day to get really good at a few boardgames and try to earn a medal at the World Boardgaming Championships.

Several years ago, I attended a mediation course with the intent on testing the waters for a possible career switch. The promised volunteer opportunities never materialized but the idea of getting some experience and starting a practice intrigues me.

I may try to get into something more technical that allows for some learning and growth – I see part-time ML opportunities like Omdena and others. Maybe I’ll look into app development and pursue some ideas.

 **Other Notes:**

I’ve been building up a bond tent this year – am currently about 49%/34%/17% US equities / International Equities /CDs.  I probably should have figured out how to buy TBills or whatever but figured the time required to understand it wasn’t worth the difference in returns vs CDs.

I currently have about $150k in taxable equities and another $70k in the NQDC plan. I am debating how much to contribute in 2025 – there’s probably a non-zero chance that upon having the discussion I’m let go before my intended retire date.. I imagine the chance is pretty small but if I’m deferring 50-75%, any unemployment benefits would be a lot smaller if I understand the way benefits are determined.

Finally, thanks to recommendations from folks on here, I’ve found some content on the podcasts “The Rational Reminder” and “Retire Often” that really resonates with me. Individual episodes are hit or miss for me, but there are plenty of gems.",92,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1gst22i/taking_an_indefinite_break/,1731780278.0,GuitarIndividual1545,1gst22i,advice_seeking
financialindependence,pay off debt,Retiring at 56 years old in one month.  Should I be worrying so much???,"I am 56 and wife is 58. A few months back my job took a turn for the worse from a political standpoint.  To say the least, I needed to make a change.  Back in the first week of March, I announced that I was going to retire -- something my wife and I had been discussing for months.  Because of the way things are at my company, they accepted my resignation and told me that we would complete the transition within the month.  In other words, no turning back.  Kids are grown, done with college, and last one is moving out next month.  No debt except a $100k balance on my mortgage (which I may pay off).

Up to a month ago, I felt financially prepared, with a >95% probability of success using various monte carlo models.  Assuming I would need about $144k per year ($12k per month) in living expenses, the 4% rule-of-thumb indicates that I would need about $5 million: ($144k/72%) x 25 = $5 million (.72 represents estimated 28% in taxes -- I am sure this is too high but want to be conservative).  I am including my ""guestimate"" for monthly healthcare premiums of $1.5k per month.  Even with the current market conditions, I have a bit over $5M in investments.  I do have about $1million in a brokerage account, remainder in IRA/401(k) accounts.

As I watch the news, I feel like this is the worst timing in history to retire.

financialindependence,pay off debt,5 Years into FIRE: From $5k After Divorce to $214k Net Worth and a New Marriage,"Five years ago, I had $5,000 to my name, was coming out of a painful divorce, and was driving a truck just to keep afloat.

This year, I am happily remarried, earning over $90,000, our debt has been reduced by almost half, and our net worth has passed $214,000. Here is how it happened.

For anyone who wants the backstory:  [Link to previous post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1ea8n56/year_4_completed_divorced_and_homeless_to_good/)

# Background: Rock Bottom in 2018 to 2020

Five years ago my life was in pieces.

* A difficult divorce that followed family loss, her violence, and infidelity
* Career struggles, spiritual questions, and financial instability
* Net worth at the time was $5,804• Income was $13.75 per hour

During the separation, I became a truck driver for 14 months. The pay was not great, but it gave me time to think while visiting 40 states.

I often say that I argued with God a lot during that year on the road, and eventually I surrendered. That surrender came in the form of returning to finish a long-abandoned seminary degree in 2020. I did not plan to use it for a career, but it was something I felt I needed to complete. Besides, I did not have but a few classes left and my credits were soon to expire.

# Career: From $13.75 to $40.64 per Hour

When my trucking work came to an end, I used that experience to become a yard driver at a distribution center. Starting this carrier is what I consider the start of my FIRE journey, rebuilding my life.

In 2020, I started as a yard driver at $13.75 per hour. After three weeks, I became a gate clerk. From there I became a yard supervisor. Eventually, I moved into my current role as area manager.

I now handle imports, ensuring loaded containers are dispatched efficiently from the ports to the distribution center. This year has been a whirlwind with ILA strikes, tariffs, challenges in the Panama Canal, and various other global supply chain disruptions.

My current compensation is $84,500 salary plus a 10 percent bonus, totaling just over $90,000 for last year.

# Personal Life: Marriage and New Priorities

This year I married a wonderful nurse who is kind, thoughtful, and still laughs at my jokes.

My priorities have shifted. I still value financial independence, but early retirement is no longer the only goal. Building a family is now more important.

We budget together using YNAB, have regular budget discussions, and talk openly about our short and long-term plans. These budget meetings usually turn into conversations about life plans.

# Debt and Net Worth Progress

When we married in December, our combined debt was $82,116. This included credit cards, student loans, a plot of land, and two cars.

Over the past year, we have paid off $42,530. Our current debt is $39,586.

**Net Worth Progress**  

* Start: $5,804 while earning $13.75 per hour 
* Year 1: $24,693 with income of $17 per hour and a savings rate of 49 percent 
* Year 2: $32,596 with a promotion bringing income to about $63,500 plus a 10 percent bonus 
* Year 3: $84,423 with a salary of $76,860 plus a 10 percent bonus 
* Year 4: $133,639 with a salary of $80,744 plus a 10 percent bonus 
* Year 5: $214,225 combined net worth with a salary of $84,500 plus a 10 percent bonus and my wife’s income of about $60,000

# Faith and Purpose: Becoming a Pastor

This year I was ordained as a pastor. It was not something I sought out, but my church strongly encouraged it. I now serve as Associate Pastor in a voluntary role.

My spiritual life today compared to five years ago is completely different. I plan to use the principles of financial independence to allow flexibility in serving churches in the future, especially those that are financially struggling or temporarily without a pastor.

# Future Plans

1. Pay off my car, which has $17,554 remaining. This should be completed by February.  
2. Begin saving for a house after the car is paid off. We already own a plot of land and plan to begin building within the next two years.  
3. Start a family and transition my wife to part-time work. Our plan is to make a significant down payment on the house so that our mortgage is manageable. We want to maintain a comfortable margin even with reduced household income.  

For me, FIRE became more than numbers. It has been the process of rebuilding a life I thought had collapsed. Whether I retire early or not, financial independence us giving my wife and I the freedom to shape our future with purpose. I could not be more grateful.

financialindependence,pay off debt,"Age 31, $700k net worth, looking for general advice & thoughts on income-focused investments.","Hey all. I'm 31, basically single, no kids, and I've been investing since my young teens. I'm starting to kind of wonder what I'm even trying to accomplish anymore. I have a good job, so I don't plan on leaving, but I definitely hunger for the chance to quit working full time and focus on things I love + my side projects, so if anything happens to this job I want to be in the position to simply stay unemployed as long as I'd like.

I’m wondering if I should start proactively building a portion of my portfolio around income-producing investments (like dividends, REITs, etc.) with the intention of:

* Hedging against fluctuations in my website income (see income section below) or day job loss
* Potentially covering part of my expenses if I ever do take a break from work
* Diversifying my income more as well as putting profits from side projects into something that generate future returns

I’m still actively investing in long-term growth, but I want to diversify into something that provides cash flow without needing to sell off assets. This would be where I invest 100% of my side business income while I'm still working full time.

# My Current Situation:

# Income

* **Day job**: $127k/year as a software developer. Remote, very annoying but not difficult, 27 days of PTO, 12 paid holidays, but unfulfilling. Been here 10 years. I’m not planning to leave because it's such a good gig, but if something changes I would like to not look for a new job.
* **Side income**: \~$65k/year from a portfolio of websites. Stable so far, with <10% operating expenses, but not guaranteed forever. I am working on diversifying this, but it isn't well diversified now so it could swing a lot.

# Living expenses

* Based in the U.S. (Ohio). Living comfortably on under $3k/month. I spend a lot more on activities but could cut most of those expenses if needed.

# Retirement Accounts

* **401(k)** – $180k
   * 46% pre-tax, 28% Roth (from earlier years), 26% match
   * Contributing 15% pre-tax currently
* **Roth IRA** – $75,600 (no longer eligible to contribute)

# Taxable Investments

* **Edward Jones**:
   * \~$14k in old mutual funds,
   * $110k in an inherited IRA. This is in some type of managed mututal fund. I have 9 years to pull it out before it's forced out and whenever I take it I have to pay income taxes.
* **Vanguard**:
   * $140k VTSAX, adding $250 every other week automatically.
   * $6k SCHD (testing the dividend waters)
   * $3k VTIAX
   * $7.5k in miscellaneous ETFs from an old robo-advisor
   * $7.5k cash (was considering putting this into income-generating assets)

# Cash / Bonds

* $60k in a 4% money market
* $10k in a 6.25% Goldman Sachs bond
* $10k in a 6.25% Royal Bank of Canada bond
* \~$8k in savings

$25k in BTC roughly. I just pretend this doesn't exist typically.

# Total Net Worth: ~$700k

No debt. No physical assets of value.

I’m looking for input on the following:

* Is it wise to start building a meaningful income-generating segment in my taxable portfolio as a safety net, or should I stay focused on total return and growth?
* What kind of allocation would make sense if I wanted to cover, say, $1k/month in passive income over the next 5 years?
* For those who’ve added income investments (like dividend ETFs, REITs, or bond ladders), did it give you peace of mind or feel like a drag on growth?
* Any recommendations for specific strategies or funds?

Trying to balance the idea of building a strong growth portfolio for official early retirement, but also trying to diversify my actual income on a shorter timeline.

financialindependence,pay off debt,"From -$75,000 Net Worth to $0","Maybe not as flashy as a $1m post, but I'm very proud of this, and hopefully it's a bit closer to home for people who are still early on like me! Let's call it a significant stepping stone.

**Background**

I graduated may 2021 with a net worth of -$75,000 due to private and federal student loans. I was lucky and was able to find work immediately after graduation with a $70k salary. This was insane to me! I grew up in rural West Virginia where my parent's income combined never surpassed ~$60k. My loans were divided almost perfectly ~$40k federal, $35k private

**First Job**

I stayed at this job for ~1.5 years and was able to maintain a 55% savings rate throughout. Initially, I built up a small emergency savings, then started saving towards my private loans. Instead of making extra payments monthly, I saved the additional payment in a HYSA. I enjoyed the security of having that extra amount in my savings vs the marginal savings of paying extra every month.

After 1.5 years, I saved enough to pay my private loans, and payed it in one bulk payment. I was then promptly laid off next week!

**Second Job**

It took 6 months to find a new role, but my emergency savings were more than enough to coast me through those months, and I landed my new and current role with a $90k salary. I increased my savings rate to 63%.

I've been there for about a year now, and just reached $0 NW! I still have a few months before I have the liquid amount to pay off my remaining debt, but my retirement account has pushed me over the edge to 0 NW.

**Next Steps**

I've been lucky to stay working, but I'm overjoyed to finally see a non-negative number! I'll be reducing my savings rate back closer to 50% I think, and start focusing a bit more on retirement savings and just some vacations. Hopefully I'll be back here in another few years once I hit my next milestone ($100k?). 

If anyone also is starting out with lots of private student debt - **REFINANCE OFTEN**. This easily was the main thing that saved me. I believe starting out, some of my private student loan's interest rates were >12%. Through refinancing several times, I was able to reduce my interest rate to 5.9% by the time I was paid off.",563,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1fle2m7/from_75000_net_worth_to_0/,1726844355.0,SpyJuz,1fle2m7,not_advice_seeking
financialindependence,credit card debt,"For someone with a lot of stock equity, wouldn't it be beneficial to use credit card grace period, dividends, 12 month 0% APY for 3% transfee fee, and an unsecured line of credit as an emergency fund instead and only keep 1 month of floating expenses?","Basically, here's how it would work...let's say you have a THREE year emergency/time-off. You only have mental energy for THREE days of setting up over the span of those three years.

You have $1M in stock and annual cost of living is $35K and you lose your unemployment income and don't want to sell your stock or hold an emergency fund and you have a 70K unsecured line of credit at 11% interest, one 2% cashback credit card, and you cycle 0% APY credit cards annually.

**Couldn't you do the following for like up to 1-3 years for emergencies:**

\- 1 month of floating expenses.

\- 1 month grace period of credit card with 2% cashback.

\- Dividend Income Quarterly (2% annually, which is like 20K pre-tax) for funds and minimum payments.

\- Use Line of Credit sparingly (maybe 10K of the funds at most).

\- Use a 0% APY credit card deal for 12 months with 3% flat fee. Just use a different credit card and then transfer the debt tto that credit card to ""consolidate the debt"".

\- Once 12 month credit card period is reaching its end, pay it off with the line of credit (like 10K tops).

\- Year 2 and 3, use another 0% APY credit card deal for 12 months with a 3% flat fee. Just use a different credit card that has 2% cashback and then transfer it to that credit card to ""consolidate the debt"".

\- Year 2 and 3, Dividend Income Quarterly (2% annually, which is like 20K pre-tax) for funds and minimum payments.

\- Year 2 and 3, do the same thing and pay with the line of credit or dividend income for debit transactions or directly towards the line of credit debit.

\- Absolute worst case scenario after three years, sell <100K of stock to pay back what's left plus taxes (but ideally you have income coming in to pay off the line of credit and deal with new costs of living).

After three years, without any ""emergency fund"" the debt paid overall is like 15% on like 40K (which is like \~6K) and another 3% for the 0% APY credit card for like 60K max which is like \~2K. If we don't even include the 2% cashback on the 3K of the expenses though, then that only costs 8K over the span of THREE years to spend 35K/year (I didn't adjust for inflation but I also over-estimated costs).

If you kept that 35K invested for 10 years and adjusted for inflation instead of sitting in a cash account, it would be like 65K after capital gains at least. Not to mention higher amounts like 70K, or 105K for three years. I'm also not even including the time for the three years that money is in the stocking market and using that to cancel out the TAXED interest of keeping an emergency fund in a cash account or CASH.TO.

**This seems like a lot but settting this up takes like <3 days in total over the span of three years.**

financialindependence,credit card debt,"30F, just hit 100k in retirement savings","I know people are far ahead of me in this subreddit but I am so excited. I was raised in a lower middle class family where credit cards were the norm. Saving for retirement was an afterthought. When my parent's divorced, I watched my parents struggle financially. It's hard to watch them still make such poor choices with spending. I was lucky to graduate college without any loans between merit based aid and part time work. I still racked up credit card debt in college and it was 2017 before I really started making better choices financially. Began 2017 with about 5k in credit card debt, 12k in a car loan, making 37k a year. Rounding out 2024 with no debt, making 78k a year.

51k in Roth IRA - VTSAX

50k in 401k

28k in HYSA, saving for a house

No debt.

I turned 30 in May this year. I could have more saved for sure but I prioritize a few trips a year (most notably, took my grandfather to Yellowstone last Fall and really glad to have that memory...this year he was diagnosed with dementia that is progressing fast. Very glad that I didn't put this trip off.)

Anyways, I guess I am just proud of myself. But I don't want to brag to people who know me. So I'm bragging to strangers..some who certainly wouldn't find this bragworthy :) I worked hard, budgeted hard, and certainly lucked out in some ways (low rent payment, no student loans). I get a lot of inspiration from the people in this sub. I need to get my income up to get myself on a better path to retiring early because I know I'm not far along in that aspect...but working on it!",717,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1gmjam3/30f_just_hit_100k_in_retirement_savings/,1731074753.0,2stressed_2beblessed,1gmjam3,not_advice_seeking
financialindependence,credit card debt,7 Years to 7 Figures- FI is really possible,"I got married in 2018. My brain was slowly maturing. After our honeymoon, with this new title of husband hanging on me, I started to wonder: what happens when we get old?

I had a car repair that I was putting off because I couldn't afford it. I was worried about money.   
  
I sat down and tallied up our account balances, we were worth negative \~$25K. I was making approximately 50K, my wife was making about 20K in a part time job. I did some calculations and realized.... we weren't making nearly enough. We had to get to work on getting our incomes up. I had started reading this page and realized that was a key ingredient. 

I tallied our net worth a few days ago, seven years later, and found our networth to be $\~1.025 million. We obviously have a long way to go still to hit FI, but I thought that progress was exciting and potentially encouraging to folks just starting out.

**Breakdown:**

·         Cash & Equivalents: \~$40,000

·         Retirement Accounts: \~$590,000

·         Home Equity: \~$400,000

Last seven year graph: [https://imgur.com/a/ZS99FCN](https://imgur.com/a/ZS99FCN)

Here’s a bit about how we did it, and some encouragement for anyone considering the path to financial independence (FI).

We started in the red, but we had some advantages. We started young, both worked hard, and began in potentially high-earning careers. We never received financial help from family.

**The biggest thing I want to emphasize is how simple this can be:**

·         Increase your income.

·         Keep expenses as low as you reasonably can.

·         Automate your savings.

·         Invest consistently.

·         Ride the wave

We’ve done a better job increasing income than minimizing spending, but we still maintain about a 34% savings rate. I (31M) work in sales. My wife (30F) was a consultant before staying home with our daughter.

**Income:**

We are now a one income household, with my income being over 300K+. I got to this level of earnings in the past two years after being in the 160-200K range for a couple of years. My wife topped out making around 150K her last couple of years. Most of her career she made an average of 100K.

Yes, I have a high income and that will make FI easier. It is half of the equation.

**To those considering FI, here’s my best advice:**

·         Put your foot on the gas early. Work-life balance is nice, but if you’re serious about FI, make hay while you can before family and life get more complex.

·         Raise your hand before you’re ready. Do your boss, and their boss, know you’re ambitious? Are you volunteering for stretch assignments?

·         Your first decade of adulthood matters. Not just for compounding savings, but for compounding work experience. Around age 30, you’ll see a real gap between those who coasted and those who pushed.

·         Look down the hall. Is there someone ten years older at your company who lives a life you’d actually want? I saw someone 8 or 9 years ahead of me making great money and decided I was going to become the next version of that guy.

·         Stop keeping up with the Joneses. If you’re over 25 and still worried about having the nicest stuff among your friends, it’s time to grow up.

·         Restrict yourself. Automate your savings and spend what’s left. Sometimes I get frustrated when we have to temporarily dip into our savings rate, but that’s a whole lot better than going into credit card debt.

Even for those starting to pursue FI later on- these principles still work. The best time to start pursuing it was earlier, the next best time is now.

There’s certainly some luck involved. We’re educated, hardworking, and in strong career fields. But you also can create your own luck with discipline, consistency, and intentional choices.

financialindependence,credit card debt,$1M Checkmark (a culmination of lessons from Reddit),"Hi all, 

It’s been about 7 years since I’ve read this subreddit at the age of 24. I’ve been wanting to share my journey and my milestone for a long time. But I'd like to say thank you to the community for providing such insightful conversations and experiences.

Relevant Tags: Low income family, student loans, avalanche method, credit card churning, Toyota Camry, IRA at a young age, tech job, deadbeat mom, FIRE depression, VTSAX and chill

Background Information:

* I grew up in a VHCOL my whole life; my dad was a postal worker and my mom was an administrative secretary. Growing up, I’ve seen my parents fight about money and hoarding (in front of me and my three other siblings) and we also got evicted from our house during the 2008 financial crisis.
* I got my undergrad degree with $28k in student loans (mainly used for living situation as tuition was waived). I got my graduate degree while living at home with no additional loans (tuition was waived). Tuition was waived due to a $70k income with 4 dependents situation. 
* In 2016, I felt really stuck with the student loans and lack of a direct career path. I decided to read up more r/personalfinance and that led me to r/financialindepence and r/churning. I started tracking all of my expenses starting 2017 and got really into churning credit cards and bank account bonuses. More on churning later. Avalanche method for the student loans win, iykyk. 
* Despite starting an expense / budget tracker, I never really budgeted based on category. I decided to live by a number I call my spending number. It was calculated by total amount of money in my bank accounts and subtracted by all expenses. It would allow me to flag certain items (insurance, student loans, emergency fund, rent, etc) in advance. If the number went into the red, that’s when I decided to spend less. 
* I front loaded my IRA every year starting in 2016. 
* I bought a used 2016 Toyota Camry with 30k miles on it for $13k. I always think about buying a nicer and newer car but pretty determined to run it down.
* Sorry to say, but I got a tech job in late 2018. And I hate it.
* My mom borrowed my credit card from me ($7k spent in 2019) to pay for a surgery and ended up not paying it back. I had to cut her off in 2023 since she started falling for scams and refused to pay me. A painful but important lesson. 
* I have had a mixture of FIRE specific depression (optimizing too much for saving money that I was living more in the future than in the present) and personal depression with family at the time. 
   * I just want to clarify that I’m doing a lot better with years of therapy and that I feel grateful for my past self for working so hard and that I am living more in the present.
* I would say I live a pretty frugal life, some minimal lifestyle creep (getting a dog, getting my own apartment, getting gym membership). I don’t really buy new clothes that often. I guess my spreadsheet will say otherwise. My hobbies have been pretty cheap and physically / mentally stimulating as well: board games, snowboarding, bouldering. 
* I was a hard core believer of VTSAX, but also just wanted to dabble in individual stocks. Did it once in 2020 ($2.5k position in Apple) and then started dabbling heavily more starting Aug 2023. I never touched the NFT / crypto / robo advisor stuff. And probably never will.

**Advice to People Starting Out:**

* I strongly advise **100% VTSAX** to people that are starting out their FIRE journey. When you have time (and some spare money), you can start dabbling and testing in individual stocks but honestly, I just got lucky. 
* Another thing that really kept me energized was churning credit cards. I want to clearly state that churning requires **one to be very responsible in completely paying off their credit card debt**. But one can get started once you have some income as early as in college. There are a ton of credit cards that **offer a $200/$300 bonus for spending $500 within 3 months**. My personal recommendation are the Chase Freedom Unlimited / Chase Freedom cards as once you dabble into the travel cards, you can convert them to more FU or Freedom cards..I talk a lot about churning but I’ve opened about 25 credit cards so far since 2013. I don’t get any of the hotel or airline credit cards and I use my points to transfer to airline partners whenever I want to fly 
* Reddit is a great place for information whether you have a question or want to learn more about something. That being said, you also need to be able to filter out some bad content. There are some great literature resources in personalfinance. I personally enjoyed JL Colin’s The Simple Path to Wealth and bought the book to support!

**Where to go from here?** 

I think I’ve worked/endured hard enough that I’m considering a career change to something more (soul) rewarding. I’m considering doing something like teaching and then doing some tax gain harvesting while I get my credential. I feel pretty energized in teaching personal finance concepts to people and would love to do some kind of high school / college workshops. I am very fortunate to learn everything I know today from Reddit and wish to pass down that knowledge to others. 

I’m honestly just burnt out from the constant politics and manipulation in my current job (having grown in a toxic family). But I’m open to people having any feedback or similar life journeys.

financialindependence,debt snowball,Financial independence using cashflow from real-estate,"**Family goals:** 

We are a family of 4 (2 kids), living in California, US. Our goal is to move outside the US in the next 3-4 years and live half way around the world for the foreseeable future. 

**Financial goals:**

* Achieve $10K/month in active cashflow from real-estate investing which matches our current spending.

My thesis is that real-estate rents & appreciation matches/beats inflation over the long run and it's way to pass down wealth. It's an active business unlike index fund investing, but that is something I feel comfortable to put in a few hours every week to manage the property manager, track numbers, build relationships etc.

**Real-estate portfolio:** 

* Own 4 properties, mostly duplexes in mid-west US.
* Cashflow is \~2K/month and leverage is \~60% (equity being 40% of current value)

Next 2 years plan:

* Buy 6 additional duplexes in the $350K range putting 25-40% down-payment. These would total 10 duplexes bringing in $30K gross rent per month and cash-flow positive about \~4K/month in the beginning.
* Accounting for appreciation (\~2%), debt pay down & cash-flow - we are getting an ROI of \~11% after accounting for all expenses. If interest rates fall in the future we will refinance to increase our ROI.

No plan to use any of the cash-flow for personal expenses and will funnel the cash-flow to pay-off existing properties. By our estimate, it should take about 10-12 years to payoff all the properties with this snowball approach. At the end of it, we should net considerably >10K/month adjusted for inflation cash-flow and can live off that without selling the properties. We will be in coastFIRE mode once we are comfortable with cashflow.

**Alternate investments:**

* Retirement funds are primarily index funds and have \~$1M that we plan to let compounds next 20 years.
* Plan to invest \~150K \* 2 in education funds over the next few years (529 plans) for kids college expenses.
* Once we turn 60, we can live off Social Security + Retirement funds by current estimates, so cashflow then would be icing on the cake.

How does the plan sound? Feedback appreciated.

  
**Updates:**

Financial situation: 

* Household income \~$750-900K/year depending upon stock markets. 
* Retirement accounts: \~1M and we do a mega backdoor contribution.
* The rest of savings we plan to pump it into real-estate and keep enough reserves.
* Rental Property math: 
   * 10 duplexes (20 units) -> $3.5M value today and equity \~1.4M.  
   * Home equity -> assuming 2% appreciation would turn into $4.4M in 11 years if the properties are paid off.
   * Cashflow: Current rents 30K/month gross and for simplicity using the 50% rule in real-estate that half of it goes away for vacancies, property-management, maintenance & capex, taxes & insurance. Rent growth is never linear but if it appreciates at 2% that would be $38K/month in 11 years. Applying the 50% rule that would be 19K/month. Accounting for depreciation we will pay <2.5K/month on taxes.

I contribute 10% of paycheck to 401k (7.5% match), and then an additional 10% net pay goes into a savings account that I move into the HYSA every 1-2 months. We're still figuring out how my spouse's pension will work. We both max our IRAs, as well as the Family HSA.  
Our monthly expenses are around $5k-$6k. I only started tracking it since approx October, so I hope that the additional visibility will help us cut down on certain areas.  
Mortgage is $2k/month.  
Utilities: $500/month

Gas: $170/month (1 car household)  
Pet costs: $80/month (usually the occasional daycare for our dog if we're out of town overnight, food for our dog and cat get lumped into grocery costs)  
Car Insurance: $100/month

There are other expenses of course, but just breaking down the basics of the larger expenses.  
Like I mentioned, we hope to retire early. The question is: how early?  
I'm aware that health care costs are significant when retiring early. Our rough plan is to move to Canada closer to retirement (I'm a Canadian citizen - green card holder, she is a US Citizen), so that we can take advantage of that glorious free health care. That's a step that we haven't fully fleshed out, so we're more than welcome to more knowledgeable people poking holes in that plan.

Can we do it? What are we missing? I'd love to hear thoughts and/or advice.

All investments are mostly total market/S&P \~80% and International/world \~20%. We got a late start to working and lost some time aggressively paid off student loans, so hold very little in bonds.

We have assets of about $1.2m, I assume 2-3 doubles before retirement. I have no idea what our number is or if it will be enough, but just assume we are ahead of most and will make it work.

financialindependence,student loan help,32 M reached 800k NW,"I (32m, single) crossed the 800k milestone today which is very significant to me. At the end of February I'll complete 8 years of working so it feels nice to reach this number before that date as it was a goal of mine for a long time.

Assets:

* Taxable brokerage: 264k
* 401k: 182k
* Checking: 48k
* HSA: 20k
* Home equity: 290k

I know including home equity is a controversial take here. However I just put 200k down in December 2023. Not considering that huge amount at all is a hard one to do as of right now. I rent out one of the rooms in my home and it helps me get some income a year so buying a home hasn't been the worst financial move I've made so far.

I got serious about investing in late 2020 and also happened to come across this subreddit then. Before that I was too scared to invest and I was focused on paying back my student loans. Was also helping out my brother so that he wouldn't need to take student loans. 2021 was a good year for stocks so my stock picking gave me some good returns however next year market was a bit down. Sold some stocks in year 2023 to make my down payment ready for my home. Stock market started recovering a few months after I sold tons of my stock (this was depressing and I was beginning to think I made many mistakes and hurt my FI chances).

I got promoted in Nov 2023 and my increased income, as well as appreciation in stock I did have, helped me a bit. In 2024 I still liquidated a ton of my company stocks since they were at an all time high. Invested that money in some other stocks which turned out to be a mistake and lost 20k last year with those poor decisions. This January end when I checked it appears my losses on stock moves reduced to 10k due to some gains elsewhere.

Here are my NW estimates for the start of every year since I completed my grad school (December 2016).  I started tracking my NW seriously after I found this subreddit late 2020/early 2021. Numbers before that are just approximation:

I work as a software engineer in a VHCOL city. I'm still working for the same company that was my first job ever. First few years it was hard for me to get noticed for my contributions but last few years I've been getting noticed and rewarded appropriately in my company. I've been promoted twice (first one was in 2020 and second was in 2023).

My W2 for the year 2024 is coming out to 230k. I'm mostly a frugal person however I did spend a lot for my home. It's always been one of my dreams to live in a home that is not necessarily large but has a certain amount of space, natural light and certain characteristics. I arguably bought more home than I could afford when I was making the decision (by FIRE metrics). I'm planning to spend on travels a bit this year. Last time I traveled was 3 years ago and other than my home I've been trying to be very conservative on many expenses.

It feels nice to finally make a post or even comment on this subreddit since I'm beginning to believe again that FI is possible for me. I would like to have the freedom to not be forced into certain job scenarios where I'm needed to put in long or hard hours. Ideally I would like to retire at age 40. If you have any advice for me I'm all ears. Will definitely give them a serious consideration.

Feel free to ask any questions. I listed out any info I thought was important and somethings I wanted to say. My current goal is to reach 1M NW before I turn 34 (I've got 18 months).",103,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1ifpdeo/32_m_reached_800k_nw/,1738471096.0,Not_Matters_Thing,1ifpdeo,advice_seeking
financialindependence,student loan help,What to do with 600k post-wildfire,"Hi all, new account, just wanted to get some various perspectives on my situation. [posting in different subs just to get more perspectives]

Currently a high earner, 450-500K annually, but only for the last 3 years, has been gradually increasing from around 250K in 2019.  I'm in healthcare, and the new political situation and the big beautiful bill has given me uncertainty about my job come 2026.  It's not like I'll ever be unemployed, but if I have to find a new job, it'll probably end up being back in the 200-250K range, though with the possibility that I again work the salary up over some years, maybe only to 300 or 350K eventually.

Our house and everything we owned burned down in the LA County fires in January.  Recently bought a new house for 1.6M, with a loan of 1.15M at 6.875%, 7y ARM (mortgage around 7500/m). The ARM was all I could get since my old mortgage is in temporary forbearance.  The SBA is giving me a 600K loan at 2.54% interest (30y fixed) (payments are around 2400/m, but start in 12 months from now).  It was supposed to be a loan that helps one purchase the home directly (like they send the money at escrow directly, and then one gets a regular loan for any remainder), but due to a number of factors like increased volume post-fire and govt layoffs post-trump, they are very very slow, and I wasn’t even sure it would happen; so I ended up purchasing the home with a regular loan, and figured I'd just wait on the SBA.  Well, they finally sent me the closing documents.  I was still under the impression that the funds would be sent directly to the lender once the SBA loan closes, to pay off the principal, and then I would have to recast the loan.  But that’s not the case, the SBA money is just sent directly to me. 

So now that it's up to me, I'm wondering what to do with this 600K.  Paying off some of that 1.15M at 6.875% and recasting the loan would be nice, both to lower the lifetime amount of interest I’d pay, and it would be great to have a lower monthly payment in case something happens to my job in 6 months.  On the other hand, I can currently afford the monthly payments (and the 2400/month SBA payment doesn't start until July 2026) so maybe I wait and see what happens. But, if I do, I'm not sure if just keeping 600K in HYSAs for 6months is the best thing to do either...  But I don't want to be too risky with it (investment-wise) in case something happens to the market.  Right now, I’m thinking I can split it up (like 400k to pay down the mortgage, 50K in HYSA, 150K investment? etc), but just wondering how to think through that.  

For additional context: 39yo, have an 8yo son, might like to consider FIRE in 10 yrs (if so, would move to a lower COL location at that point).   Current assets: 650K in retirement accounts (401K/IRAs), 550K in post-tax investments (like ETFs), 100K in HSA/529, and 275K in the bank (HYSAs).  Two relatively new paid-off cars, no student loans, no debts besides the two aforementioned loans. 

What do you suggest for the 600K?

financialindependence,student loan help,FIRE Journey 1 year update (2006-2025),"[**My 2024 original post** ](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1bse4l0/data_from_my_fi_journey_20062024/)

  
Hi all! I'd been wanting to share an update on the raw data from my FI journey but things have been busy! I've added the data from all of last year 1/01/2024 - 12/31/2024 on the last line in the chart. You can find my orginial post with more details in the link above but pasting the reflections here again for convenience!  
  
**Some reflections and notes:**

* I believe we didn't do anything novel... I think a lot of our financial growth was due to market timing (investing through the bull market) and being able to buy our starter and current home before the market spiked and rates went up.
* It is worth noting that we adopted the ""time in market is better than timing the market"" mentality and simply set up automatic deductions from my paycheck into the market (as much as we could afford through saving - adjusting each year).
* I worked through 4 years of university but still had to take out some loans that needed to be repaid. My wife chose to go community college route and worked 20-25 hours a week after school to help pay for tuition and amazingly didn't have to take out loans.
* I benefited from a strong job market where I was able to make several job changes quickly, increasing my income significantly.
* Both my wife and I have seen considerable income growth in our current roles (FAANG but non-engineering), thanks to multiple job promotions, as depicted in the chart. As this happened, our compensation structure shifted notably towards company stock, fueling our year-on-year income growth.
* Our current home value has doubled in value since 2017 which had a big impact on our networth.
* A majority (80%) of my investments are in ETFs and low expense Mutual Funds.

Hopefully folks find this data intersting! I've been tracking data since 2006 and update yearly. Happy to any answer questions!

financialindependence,student loan help,"One year FI: How I got here and how it's going, a novella. (Alt title: A Sentimental Journey)","By popular demand (well, 2 people - [comment in Friday’s daily thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1merhk3/comment/n6cw0pf/?context=3))

Warning: long; there is a lot of ""personal"" in my personal finance.

**Timeline**

pre-1999: Raised by parents who never finished high school and were lifelong renters. I was the only child of this union but have several older (14 - 20 years older) half-siblings.  My mother was a SAHM but that was due mostly to her untreated mental health issues and not having learned to drive. She was the only mother in our circle who neither worked nor drove.

My father worked, with a long commute and long hours.  We were lower SES and literally on the wrong side of the tracks, at least for the pizza delivery I liked. My father paid cash for cars and would have cut off his left nut before financing one. I was told repeatedly that I was going have to do well in school and get a college education to make it in the world, and my dad heavily emphasized (starting when I was about 5 years old) that ""It's a dog eat dog world,"" but I didn't get any specific guidance, financial or otherwise, beyond that. 

There was always an underlying fear of losing our apartment, although not on account of money. My mother worried we'd get a new owner who didn't allow cats, and my father worried we'd get one who didn't like black people.

Starting around age 12, I did a lot of kid/teenager hustles/jobs - paper route, baby sitting, pet sitting, tutoring, waitressing, etc.  Also worked a few months for Citibank phoning people delinquent on their credit card accounts, impressing upon me that I wanted to never be on the receiving end of such calls.

I was late learning how to drive because ""insurance is expensive,"" but again, was not given any actionable information about this. Was it $200? $2000? Who could know.  As directed, I did well in school and went to college (where I lived in dorms, because no car) where I majored in History, because I liked it.  Worked all through college, of course. Next 10 years were travel, miscellaneous entry level jobs, one fairly serious mental health break (requiring hospitalization), 2 relationships with people who were not relationship material, and grad school (because I had nothing better to do and a lot of my friends were going).  Lost one sibling (which was devastating to my mother’s MH) to AIDS. Lost another (dad’s side) to pulmonary fibrosis.  Dad never talked about her after the funeral.

I read ""Your Money or Your Life"" somewhere in this decade, and later on ""The Millionaire Next Door,"" and thought, well, sounds nice for people with real jobs.

1999:

Bought my first home computer, which happened to have Microsoft Money pre-installed.  Started using it because why not, seemed like something a responsible, almost 21st century adult might do.  Gradually it dawned on me that I was, like, actually saving money.      

2001: 

	NW unknown, but surely negative due to mortgage and remaining student loan balances

Age: 33

Gross pay: $46K (After successfully negotiating a bump from the $44K initially offered)

Started (perm/FTE) what unbeknownst to me would be my career for the next two decades, after four years of temp/PT/contract work with The Company.  Bought a condo, paid extra on mortgage principal, and contributed enough to 401k to get the 6% match.  Still had money left over.  Huh. 

2003-2004: After much research (on the internet of course, but also from books about economic history and cycles), bought some gold.  Was kind of put off by the collapse/conspiracy aspect of it, but I had some memories of 1970s inflation, so it seemed like a good idea at the time. Purchased at <$400/oz (adjusted for inflation, about $650/oz).

Let a sibling live with me for free, and lent him what felt like a lot of money, which went about like you would expect.

  
2005-2012: Content to just be surviving.  Employed, not in prison, not in rehab, not trapped in relationship with a loser?  Great, at least according to my family's standards.

Visited BFF on opposite coast about every other year.  Got sibling out of my home.

Lost my mom (slow) and then my dad (fast).  Missed some earnings while caring for them, and then more (2 months on short term disability) when I had another mental break after they died within months of one another. I inherited the cash in their savings/checking accounts, their only real assets, just enough to have broken even financially.

Acquired teenaged foster daughter, making me feel less broken. (There is a good FIRE story involving her, as well, but that would need a separate post.) 

Spent 2006-2007 wondering why people were so comfortable taking out huge mortgages/cash-out refinancing up to their ears.  Spent 2008-2009 worrying about my construction-adjacent job (half of the seniors in my group were let go), but since I had refinanced my mortgage to a lower rate and put money *in*, it never even occurred to me to take money *out* of retirement accounts, or to change them in any way. Just kept up with my 401k contributions, bumping them up once in a while, sometimes back down, but never below the match.  Meanwhile, The Company was also contributing 4% of my base pay into a cash balance (formerly pension) plan, so I always had at least 16% of my pay going into workplace retirement accounts, but sometimes more.  

2009: Bought my first and only new car (reliable Honda FTW) with an assist from the ""Cash for Clunkers"" program (my old car had \*just\* started belching blue smoke).    With my father's ghost muttering in my ear, I paid it off ($17K) in about 6 months, which is the longest I'd ever taken to pay off a car.

This is the car I still drive today.

2010: Paid off the condo.

2011: My last surviving grandparent, the one I probably take after the most, died at the age of 99.

She’d lived mostly independently until she was 92.

January 2013

* Retirement:            $  168,000
* Non-Retirement:     $   56,000
* Mortgage Bal.:      ($  136,000)
* Total NW:               $    88,000

Once I had well over $100K in my 401k, I felt I ought to . . . do something, but what?

At this stage, I had either never heard of FIRE, or had summarily dismissed it as something for other people.  I viewed my retirement accounts as something I could possibly *maybe* leverage into a meaningful supplement to Social Security, which I assumed would be 80-90% of my retirement income, and that I would retire at best at 63 if I were super lucky, but more likely 65 or later.  After all, my father had worked into his eighties.

I had just sold my condo (sold low) but just bought my dream house (bought low - at a historic low, actually), and my only long term financial plan was to pay off the mortgage early.  I also had recently spent about $60K to fix an issue in the condo that hadn't been covered by insurance.  I felt this setback meant any fleeting thoughts of early retirement were out of the question.  Overall, owning the condo was a wash financially, but it did teach me that yes, I really wanted a house.  A house where nobody can kick me out just because I have cats, so there's that.    

Got promoted to senior role in my department at work.  Despite applying for a couple of lateral positions over the coming years, this is where I was to remain. I wanted to move mostly because I was struggling with changes (BS processes) in my department and I thought I would be less agitated if I were doing something new; the money would have been about the same.  I don't interview well, and at least one of those positions was posted but really The Company had already decided who would get it. (When I asked my manager ""what could I have done better/how can I improve"" he breezily informed me that the successful candidate was ""a good ole boy"" and that's what they had wanted).

2014

* Retirement:                 $  201,000
* Non-Retirement:         $   82,000
* Mortgage Bal.:           ($   99,000)
* Total NW:                    $  184,000

Was starting to fear for my job (asshole dotted line boss), and in my mid-forties knew I would be facing serious age discrimination very soon.  Looked around (outside my company), couldn't find anything better, and figured I'd better hang on for dear life.  Fear/anxiety drove me to be even more aggressive about paying down the mortgage.  Figured I could live on minimum wage if I had to, as long as the house was paid off.

Attended funeral for a nephew who had died in a motorcycle accident.  He was 38.

January 2015

* Retirement:                $  227,000
* Non-Retirement:         $   99,000
* Mortgage Bal.:           ($   87,000)
* Total NW:                   $  239,000

Gross pay: $87K

 Started taking FIRE semi-seriously around 2015.  It still seemed like it was for higher earners/higher risk takers.  I thought I'd be lucky to get out at 61. Maybe 59?  But it was still offering a path and some specific strategies for financial stability that I could get on board with.

In a rare genuinely impulse purchase, I bought a Kickstarter e-bike, and started commuting to work on it when the weather was favorable.  The route is partially along a river, and starting my day with a bit of nature helped my mental health in a non quantifiable but nevertheless significant way.

April 2017

Equifax 837 Transunion 850 Experian 850. I knew I wouldn’t see numbers like this again as the student loans fell off my history and I paid off the mortgage.

August 2017 

Paid off mortgage

* Retirement:          $  338,000
* Non-Retirement: $    71,000
* Total NW:             $  409,000

DJIA was at about 24,000.

A co-worker I knew and liked died while working out in the company gym.  He was 60.

  
2018

Turned 50/became eligible for catch-up contributions, which I could easily fund now that the mortgage was out of the way.

Maxed out everything in sight, including after-tax 401k up to $59K or whatever the limit was at the time.  Still anticipating an age 59-61 exit date, because I was assuming 4% growth in my long term projections. I mean, the stock market couldn't really keep going up like this forever, right?  I didn’t make full after tax contributions after this year, but continued to do at least some.  The Company didn’t offer in-service rollovers so it wasn’t *quite* as advantageous as it is for people who have that.

April 2020

* Retirement:        $  529,000
* Non-Retirement: $   50,000
* Total NW:            $  579,000

I was a bit rattled because someone in my department had recently committed suicide. This was someone I’d worked with for 20 years, and we were assigned to the same software development project at the time. We’d sat across from each other for a few years and we’d said good morning to each other every day, a habit we continued on and off for years, over Skype when we were in different places. (That was it, usually; we both appreciated that our ritual exchange didn’t require further chitchat).  Our last actual conversation was about tracking the laptops we were handing out to people to work from home -  he had been one of the last people working on site - and the last thing I’d said to him was “See you on the other side.”  
  
During  a phone call with a longtime friend, trying to figure out how we were going to navigate pandemic world, she asked me if I was going to pull my retirement money out of the stock market.  She also berated me for ""dwelling"" on my co-worker's death a full two weeks after the fact.  Not long after that, our 30+ year friendship fell off a cliff and never recovered.

July 2021

* Retirement:        $  825,000
* Non-Retirement: $   89,000
* Total NW:            $  924,000

Got truly serious about FIRE.  The market was up, quarantine had taught me that I can in fact entertain myself in my own home for an extended period of time, my overlords at The Company were seriously ramping up with the BS processes and metrics, and we were being pressured to contract out any the parts of the job left that I still kind of liked.

Moved some of my settlement fund/money market fund investments into VTSAX.

2023 

Turned 55/became eligible for the retiree medical plan! I was never going to voluntarily leave before this milestone no matter what.

Foster daughter was on the cusp of earning what I do, and got married to someone finishing school to earn twice that.  

A co-worker I didn’t know who worked at another site died while working out at the company gym.  He had about the same job description I did, and was about the same age I was.

December 2023 

Achieved my number in retirement accounts.

* Retirement:           $1,000,000
* Non-Retirement:    $  155,000
* Total NW:              $1,155,000

$35K\* annual spend is actually sustainable for me, so $1M really was my number.  I had already projected my retirement date for mid 2024 (because of my pessimistic 4% growth projections), so stuck with that (enabling me to stuff another $50K into retirement accounts).  The non-retirement money (mostly cash/cash equivalent) is/was to sustain me to 59-1/2.

(\*My 2018-2023 spend was consistently <$25K/year, but that's with employer-paid health insurance.)

Gross pay (including bonus): $113K

My contributions + employer contributions to my retirement funds: $54,146.85

August 2024 (last day worked mid-July 2024)

* Retirement:          $1,160,000
* Non-Retirement: $   175,000
* Total NW:             $1,335,000

A crisis on one of my projects fell in my lap just hours before I walked out the door for the last time.  I honestly don't know how I made it as long as I did.  One of the features I loathed about the job was how projects from weeks/months/years prior could suddenly rear their ugly heads out of nowhere.  I do not miss it.  

For my complete, official work history 1985-2024, I’m just a tad shy of the third bend point for Social Security earnings.

  
August 2025

* Retirement:$1,257,000
* Non-Retirement: $  168,000
* Total NW:$1,425,000

Counting home equity, I have just about $2M in assets. Not bad starting from less than zero in 2001 and spending my career as an imposter syndrome-ridden, liberal arts degreed individual contributor.

**Fortuna:**

There was quite a bit of luck involved, besides the obvious stock market performance.  A lot of being in the right place at the right time.  I didn't know the temp job I took in 1997 would mutate into the career I would eventually retire from.  This job consistently paid about 25%-30% more than the average HHI in my city.  From Day One until the day I retired, I treated this as a “Make hay while the sun shines” situation.

I'm not the salary negotiating type, and I only did it once, in 1999, at the urging of my mentor (and I was lucky to have had a mentor).  But that meant that all my subsequent pay increases were built on just a slightly higher base than it would have been otherwise (at least until about 2015, when HR did one of those industry comparables reviews and adjusted everyone's pay accordingly).

I held onto my job during the GFC. I had just enough experience to be productive/valuable, but not so much that I was in the higher tiers of pay.

I didn't know at the time that the two moments in which I bought real estate would be at just about the inflation-adjusted lows of my adult lifetime.  

Couldn't have known the gold I bought in 2004 would be ditto - at the inflation-adjusted low of my adult lifetime.  

Seriously, I couldn't have timed it better if I'd had a time machine.  But it's also part of my personality that I wouldn't have bought either gold or real estate if I hadn't already had my financial ducks in a row, and if I hadn't perceived their prices at the time to be a value. I bought gold because I wanted something tangible, and real estate because I wanted to live in it. 

Another bit of luck: I'm basically healthy, at least physically.  And I have good teeth.  I've been watching a former co-worker spending upwards of $35K on dental work, ouch.  

It all adds up.

**Spend**

My expenses in retirement are exactly what I expected, having tracked my spending for 26 years (from Microsoft Money to Quicken to GnuCash). My first full year retired I spent $33K, including the $9216 I paid for health insurance. Actually, the bulk of my spend consists of health, home, and auto insurance.  I hate eating out, and have time to cook from scratch, and am eating well for about $215/month.  The cats are getting the higher-end cat food and I finally had *time* to take them to the vet this year.  

The other big key to my low spend is that I have little interest in travel these days.  I did travel when I was in my twenties and spent over a year outside the US, and I absolutely think everyone who can afford to should spend some time more than 100 miles from where fate dropped them,\* but now it seems exhausting and I don't wanna. That said, I had college reunion this year, and hadn't seen the kid in a while, so I did spend some time on the opposite coast, facilitated by CC rewards.

(\*During one of those workplace cheerleading events we had to fill out some kind of Bingo card and identify people who were going to be traveling out of state for the upcoming Thanksgiving (or maybe it was Christmas) holiday.  I was the only person in a room of 40 people who was going anywhere. We are <20 miles from a state border.)

Honestly, I still see things I could cut, if push came to shove.  I am very honest in my tracking and have categories for ""gazingus"" to account for stuff I know perfectly well I didn't need.  Like many retirees in this position/phase, the real ""problem"" right now is that I could and arguably should be spending more than I do. I do assume I will get Social Security, although I use 75% of my calculated entitlement in my projections. 

**Time**

My main hobbies are baking, gardening, and knitting, and they are all very scalable.  Technically, I already have most of the tools and supplies to do them for years to come, but I can also splurge on tools/toys if I really want to.  For example, I just finally pulled the trigger on an Ankarsrum stand mixer AND the ice cream maker attachment.

If you've read through all this you can probably tell I'm kind of risk-adverse/avoidant.  Not always, but most of the time. Living with ADHD/anxiety/depression is frequently debilitating, but I've tried to turn my maladaptive traits into advantages as best I can.  Thankfully, I've been able to apply my ADHD hyperfocus superpowers on personal finance/tracking, and I have gone down the rabbit hole of various financial topics over the years enough to provide me with a big picture of what I need to do.  I *love* spreadsheets. Also, while some people with ADHD are prone to impulse shopping, I am much more likely to ruminate endlessly over spending decisions, which carries its own problems, but does heavily reduce impulse spending.

Another huge benefit of ADHD, IMHO: I have \*zero\* doubt that the most valuable commodities in my life are my time and my attention.  Once my financial needs were met, pulling the trigger was relatively easy.  The fear of not having enough was assuaged by math/this subreddit/years of planning.  The far, far greater fear I have is of squandering what's left of the limited good years of my life in corporate serfdom.  

Also, I will never run out of things to do, because I am always procrastinating \*something\*.

Now, I genuinely love savoring my coffee in the morning and not gulping it down in the midst of trying to get out of the house.  Sometimes I even hand-grind the beans.  I love being able to work in the garden in the cool of summer mornings and not having to spend the best part of the day chained to a computer.  I love having time to properly cook and savor the food from my garden. I can spend a whole day making jelly or tomato sauce when the cherries and tomatoes are ready.  I can bake big batches of bread and share it with my neighbors.  I just divided the saffron crocus bulbs and am really looking forward to harvesting from 90+ plants. Come winter, I can binge watch Lower Decks and spend a week knitting myself cozy custom socks if I feel like it. I still have trouble sleeping sometimes, but at least it's without the constant background chant ""You only have \_\_ hours until you have to get up for work.""

I've only put 500 miles on my car YTD. Some people would see this as evidence of constraint in my life.  But the only person I like to hang out with (and his grandchildren, whom I enjoy) lives only a couple of miles away. I can walk to a grocery store and a weekly farmer's market, and I still have that e-bike.  I see it as ""I've only had to spend 17 hours in my car this year.""

Maybe I will eventually heal my relationship with time (I realize I probably need therapy for this). The insidious tragedy of ADHD is that even though *technically* I always had the same 24 hours as everyone else, most of those hours were inaccessible to me because it's so hard to switch from one task to another, and I always had to put work first, spending my “free” time too paralyzed to choose what I wanted or needed to be doing.  Now I can allocate my limited decision-making bandwidth to getting bids for a new roof, or deciding where I should build the next garden bed, or what color to stain my woodworking projects. Or, god help me, going to the gym, because by golly I am getting my money's worth from that ice cream maker attachment.

financialindependence,student loan help,FI side to life with partner,"**Long-time lurker, first-time poster—looking for some financial guidance.**

My fiancé and I sold our condos and bought our first home together about six months ago. We were lucky to have built up solid equity in our condos, which we rolled into the new house. When we moved in, I cut back my 401k contributions to free up cash for all the expenses that come with relocating and settling in. That flexibility helped a lot during those initial months, but now we're in a much more stable spot.

We’re currently bringing in around **$5,000 more per month than we spend**, and I want to make sure we're using that surplus wisely. Right now:

* We're **fully maxing her HSA**
* We're **contributing to our 401ks up to the company match**

I’ve always been hooked on FI, but I'm debating our next move. Should we:

* **Ramp up 401k contributions** to reduce our taxable income, even though we already have a decent amount saved?
* **Throw extra money at our mortgage** to chip away at the obscenely high interest rate?
* **Dial it back and enjoy life a bit**, especially with our wedding coming up in February and plans to start a family by 2028?

**Me (36M):**

* **Income:** $1,237/week after taxes

financialindependence,ready to buy a house,FIRE with $1.7~mil when the majority is in Bitcoin?,"I realize Bitcoin being the title is probably going to give some polarizing opinions, but I'm hoping the comments can be more grounded and not full of FUD :)
I'll give a breakdown of my numbers and situations to get opinions

&nbsp;

**Employment situation:** I got laid off a couple of months back. I do remote work in tech. No crazy FAANG pay, but pretty good for the low cost of living state I'm in. I've been looking for a job to keep up with the requirements for unemployment benefits (that will run out in early February). I'd be up for another job (in my field) but I'd really like an upgrade and something fulfilling that I'd like to learn. Even if that were to happen I still wouldn't be super thrilled about it in general, but regular steady income would be nice for a few more years to (over?) prepare. I'd probably hate it much worse though if I had to return to work 5+ years later for a worse job after being out of the market. I guess ideally if I was going to continue working it'd be something more entrepreneurial like making any indie game or something, but I don't feel like I have the right personality to be dedicated enough for self-employment and all the unknown risk involved in that, so I stick with regular employment with the skills I have.

&nbsp;

**Financial situation:** I'm 40 and my wife is 37. Our house is paid off. We mostly keep our finances separate due to different goals and spending habits, but split the bills. She would like to early retire too, but seems more chill and less concerned about it. She takes my advice for saving for retirement, but isn't specifically working towards a hard number for her retirement savings or age to retire (though she's kinda casually said maybe 55). So here's my numbers:

* Bitcoin: $1,300,00~ worth currently
* Retirement accounts: $410,000~ (though $86k~ of that is FBTC in my Roth IRA because I really wanted some Roth exposure with Bitcoin too). The rest is mostly S&P500 style index funds.
* Cash: $51k (checking + HYSA)
* Only debt: $39k solar loan, 3.99%
* My half of the yearly required expenses: Slightly less than $15k (that includes nothing optional such as eating out, fun outings etc.). I'm also earmarking $5k/year for my half of vacation funds.
* My plan: start out overly conservative (me worrying about money, Bitcoin's volatility, etc.) and have a budget of $30k/year for 1 to 4 years until I feel more comfortable and see how things go starting out. Expenses minus vacation would give me $10k/year left for optional fun things, unexpected surprise expenses etc. (Even if I did bump it to $40k/year that would feel pretty splurgy for my general spending habits).
* Wife's retirement accounts: $280k~ (mix of target date and VTSAX). Not super relevant for my portion of the plan, but thought I'd put it out there. Also, she's a RN that makes pretty good money here.

&nbsp;

**Original plan(s):** 

* Originally years ago when Bitcoin was less established and I considered it far more of a wild card, I just considered it a potential bonus and didn't factor it into my real FIRE calculations. I estimated I could hit $1mil by age 55 or little before (w/o BTC) and do the 4% rule or a little less.
* After BTC become a significant portion of my wealth and appeared to have much more staying power, I roughly planned that if I was going to use it to FIRE then I'd wait for it to appear to fairly confidently have a bottom of $150k (so $2mil worth for me), so me and my wife could retire at roughly the same time (if she wanted to), since I thought it'd seem unfair for me to just FIRE loooooong before her as soon as I could with it mostly being due to a very lucky investment.

&nbsp;

**Reservations:**

* Historically BTC has 4 year boom and bust cycles based around the new supply halving schedule. If this continues it'll go even higher in 2025, then probably crash into 2026 and 2027. Of course even if that happens I don't know what the bottom of the crash would be. Basically it'd really suck mentally to FIRE, run out of cash sometime in 2026, then have to start selling small amounts of BTC to live off of right as it potentially starts having a major crash, even if statistically I'd probably be fine after averaging it out with the boom from the next cycle.
* I guess I always assumed when I FIRED it would be more deliberate. As I got close to my number I'd probably pay off the solar loan just to be debt free and minimize expenses, probably splurge on some nice new PC, TV, and other electronics upgrades, and maybe some minor house remodels/enhancements to have some nice new stuff to last me for while paid for by my regular income before it goes away.
* Greed? Not that I'm considering super bullish BTC statements as iron clad but with the ETFs, talk of a US national BTC reserve, etc. is leading to talks of some insane gains in the coming years I guess it makes me wonder things like ""well if I just worked another 5 or so years maybe I could easily buy a vacation home in Tokyo"" or something and have a more luxurious retirement. I don't care about fancy cars, boats, etc. Besides nice electronics the only luxuries I don't have now that I might care about is being able to travel multiple months of the year (who knows if I'd get tired of that though after a small number of years).
* If the Affordable Care Act gets revoked. I guess It'd be fine while my wife is working and I'm on her insurance, but then when she's ready to retire early that'd probably be a problem if no reasonable replacement for the ACA is in place by then (unless BTC has gone so crazy that we can afford whatever crazy expensive private insurance).
* As mentioned above I didn't want to be unfair to my wife, but the layoff prompted financial what-if discussions and she was more chill about it than I anticipated. I think she'd prefer I get another job for now mostly for fear of what if I pull the trigger now, it fails in 10 years, then I'm having to go back to work then in a much worse situation. Ultimately she said she's fine with it as long as I can pay my portion of the bills and vacations (not diminish our standard of living).",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1hcvnvi/fire_with_17mil_when_the_majority_is_in_bitcoin/,1734038247.0,another_FI_throwaway,1hcvnvi,advice_seeking
financialindependence,ready to buy a house,Seeking Housing Guidance - Divorced and Not FIRED,"Hi. Long time lurker. My wife, soon to be ex-wife, and I have been working towards FIRE for over a decade. We’re on the precipice of FIRE together, but I’m transgender and it’s a sticking point with her which has led to us parting ways. We own our home outright and will split assets 50/50. After cashing out of the home equity and splitting assets I’ll conservatively be left with $987,500 invested; conservative being I took $50k less than the math shows for any lawyer and house selling fees or if something happens and this doesn’t stay amicable. 

Assets will be: ~$987,500 mixed between brokerage, Roth, and 401k (currently our invested assets divided by 2 is $860k)

Gross Annual Income: $131,000

Monthly Net Income: $5,500

Debts: $0

I have estimated my monthly non-housing expense to be about $2k. That takes into account vacation too. It could be as high as $2,500. I live a very minimal lifestyle. Of course this is an estimate as I haven’t lived alone in over 10 years. 

I’m stuck in my life transition on what to do about housing. I have a stable job and great benefits. I’m not looking to move out of my city or state for at least 5 more years. I make good money and I’m going to need it for the healthcare which I’m seeking including expensive surgeries. So I’m not looking to retire just yet. I have to wonder if I am happier with myself if I’ll be more happy working and socking away money. 

I live in a LCOL city and rent vs buy calculators show a break even point of 3-5 years depending on the area. The area I’m looking at I need $350k to get exactly what I want. That comes out to like $2,100 every month. I do my own maintenance and am a handy person so I don’t expect to pay money for tradesmen unless it’s roofing, AC, or a major issue; all of which hopefully will come up in an inspection. 

However, it’s difficult not to run the numbers through a time value of money calculator and see the opportunity cost of how much I could have invested if I live a little further from work and from my people. Right now I feel it’s worth the extra expense to live in this area. I also hear people say don’t make major life decision after divorce. It’s difficult for me to rent because I feel like I’m throwing money away. 

This has turned into a book, but I don’t know any other way to get my story across. If you made it this far, thank you. I hope this has all been clear and enough information for the whole story. I’m ready to get on with my life and housing is what I’m stuck on. 

I guess I’m looking for advice and other perspectives which I might be missing.",6,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1m3hkfq/seeking_housing_guidance_divorced_and_not_fired/,1752882043.0,Brilliant_Gur7072,1m3hkfq,advice_seeking
financialindependence,ready to buy a house,Inching Closer to FI: Advice Wanted,"My significant other and I have been slowly pursuing FI for a bit. We are 37 and 38 with 3 kids under 5. We both like our jobs with the federal government but the current fed situation makes want to be ready to be FI for the day we don’t have work or don’t enjoy it anymore.

Current situation:

401k: $807k

IRA: $142k

Mutual Fund: $530

HSA: 26k

Total Liquid (all of the above):$1,505k

House: $500k equity + $250k with 10 yrs left of on a 15yr (2.5APR mortgage). We pay $35k/year and expect to just pay it off slowly. We like where we live with family and community. 

529s:80k. We don’t consider this “ours” any more and don’t necessarily want to pay for everything. Want each kid to have like half-ish covered for a 4yr degree. Seems like we want to put another 80k in and let it ride.

Annual Costs: have been $40kish but we expect that to go up with the 3kids as vacations and our outdoor hobbies will cost a bit more. The mini van we bought this year definitely put us in the 60k range. This doesn’t include the $36k a year in mortgage payments currently or our $25k in kid care which would decrease (but not go away) if FI. We live in a HCOL area where the preschool costs 1500-2000/kid but the army has a childcare subsidy program that covers a bit over half this cost. We mostly bike for our daily commutes and eat at home and buy used stuff. Our hobbies are mostly low cost outdoor things, food stuff, kids sports and music. This doesn’t include health care costs… 

One of us has been a fed 16 yrs (currently GS15)and the other 8 years (GS13+20% SSR on top of cola). We’ve always thought we’d be getting 20-40k in pension someday but that seems like a risky assumption at this point kinda like social security. 

We are thinking we will save at least another 500k to keep paying down the mortgage slowly and have a bit more cushion. Also sock a bit more into the 529s. We both derive positive meaning from our jobs and at least one of us is planning to work into FI for a while until we both call it quits.

First off income wise: career job 100k/year, currently work 1-2 days a week as a server making average $4-500 a week, but most likely quitting soon and want to ignore this income preferably. Rents: $3200/month from second house is $2000 and rental of additional bedroom is $1200.

Safety net of around $20k at the moment.

financialindependence,ready to buy a house,"33M, $10M Mortgage Broker Volume, ~$800K Net Worth — Lean Lifestyle, Self-Processing, Ready to Scale. Feedback Appreciated!","Hey r/FIRE,



I discovered this subreddit in 2017 when i was making around 45k a year and 50k in debt from a student loan.  Periodically over the years i have come back to check in with where im at and gives thanks to you all for putting me on this path. Today I wanted to share my current financial situation and get your thoughts, advice, or critiques as I continue on my FIRE journey. Here’s a snapshot of where I’m at:



\*\*About Me:\*\*  

\- 33 years old, single, no kids  

\- Work as a mortgage broker, typically self-process my deals  

\- Annual loan volume around $10M  

\- Rough gross income \~2–2.5% per deal → around $200K+ per year net before taxes. My income can be pretty variable (2020 made 217k, 2021 made 340k, 2022 made 240k, 2023 made 140k, 2024 made 160k, YTD i am around 100k).

\- I live lean, minimal lifestyle inflation (mostly spend on food, travel, and golf, which I write off as business expenses)



\---



\*\*Assets & Net Worth:\*\*  

\- Two houses:  

  \- House 1: Worth \~$425K, mortgage \~$140K, HELOC $160K available (unused), rented for $2,000/mo with \~$1,100 positive cash flow  

  \- House 2: Worth \~$700K as-is, owe \~$460K, planning $30K renovation to push value to \~$775K+  

\- IRA: \~$150K (converted from old 401k)  

\- Cash savings: \~$170K (plus $160K available on HELOC)  

\- Collectibles: \~$50K+ (appreciating, including some valuable autographs and a Rolex)  

\- Cars: One paid off ($7K), one with $24K loan on $32K car  

\- HSA: \~$8K  

\- No credit card or student loan debt



\---



\*\*My Mistake:\*\*  

Back in 2022, when I switched jobs and the mortgage market turned, I stopped contributing to my 401k (no match at new company) and converted my old 401k into an IRA. Since then, I’ve only contributed around $7,000 to my IRA. I prioritized building a strong cash reserve to finish my house renovation, prepare to buy another home, and have a solid rainy day fund in case of income fluctuations.  



\---



\*\*Current Plan:\*\*  

\- Finish renovating House 2 (\~$30K reno), then rent it out. I already spent way more than i planned on this house (already 120k deep on reno) and have been dreading spending more money on it, but in its current state its not as desirable as if i spend another 30k on it. 

\- Buy a new primary residence — I usually buy “ugly” houses in nice neighborhoods and live in them while renovating to build equity then rent it out and buy a new one

\- Continue growing my net worth while maintaining a lean lifestyle  

\- Start maxing out retirement accounts again (looking into Solo 401k or SEP IRA options)  

\- Keep my HELOC as a flexible capital tool  

\- Maintain strong emergency fund and liquidity. I feel as though my emergency fund is important because my income can be cut in half with one lost relationship or a market downturn. 



\---



\*\*Questions for the community:\*\*  

\- Does my plan to finish my house, rent it out, and buy another primary property make sense for someone aiming for FIRE?  

\- Should I use my HELOC for renovations or pay cash?  

\- How soon do you think I can hit $1M+ net worth if I keep my current income and savings rate?  

\- Any recommendations on restarting retirement contributions after the pause?  

\- Should i consider hiring employees and growing out my business? I tend to enjoy where im at in terms of flexibility and freedom but i am talented at what i do and i know i could train some people and grow my business and increase my income. Im a little afraid because with employees comes more responsibility and pressure but that could double or triple my income.

\- General feedback on my asset allocation and risk profile?

financialindependence,buy vs rent,28 y/o nurse. Rent vs buy home. When can I retire?,"Hello! I live in the VHCOL area of the SF Bay Area. It’s the best place in the country to be a nurse for my savings rate. All of my family is in this area so currently at this stage of life I don’t see myself leaving this area. I make $150-220k a year depending on how much I want to work. My required minimum of 24 hours a week gives me $150k. My biggest goals in life would be to work part-time doing two 12 hour shifts a week, get married and have a stay at home wife, and raise kids together. I would then use the difference in my time to be a part-time stay at home dad and travel very often as well with my family. Currently, I’m just trying to travel the world as often as I can before I get married. It’s a big enough part of my life that I could see myself spending $20-$40,000 a year. Here are my stats. Everything I own is in the s&p 500:

$420k in brokerage $135k in 401k $40k in IRA No debt Renting an apartment Single

I am maxing out my 401k each year. No longer contributing to IRAs because I’d rather have the money more liquid in a brokerage account to use for a home purchase. I roughly save at least $3500-5000 a month and put it all in the brokerage. At this rate it’s likely to have 1.25-1.5 million in my brokerage alone in the next 6-8 years. However old fixer upper homes in my area start at that price. Given the current interest rate environment that we are in it seems like it is actually cheaper to rent and invest the difference into my brokerage account and keep on growing my stocks, and also maxing out my 401(k), than to buy a home. From what I could see after the numbers it seems like the only way that a home is a better financial decision in this area is if you put 100% down which I could do in about a decade, but is that even a wise decision at that point?

Should I rent or buy? If I buy, what is the most effective way to use my money to do this? It seems the longer I hold onto this brokerage account for long enough it will actually rapidly surpass how fast a house can gain equity and increase in value. If I were to buy my rough plan was to continue working and pull out about 100 or $200,000 from the brokerage account each year to pay down the loan assuming I have married and filing jointly at that point.

Every resource I look at says that I should be invested in IRA, but in this scenario of wanting to buy a home, is it sensible to do so?

Another thought is that as a Christian, I want to give large sums of money to organizations and churches that I care about. If I rent, I could very easily give away $100,000 a year in a decades time, which could be much more fulfilling than owning a house. What are some good tax strategies for excessive giving?

If I rent, then I would very likely be able to retire before 40 years old. But I will probably still just work the bare minimum hours to keep benefits and give myself something to do.

Another question I have is that I’m a really good saver, but I have such a hard time spending money. Any resources for how to shift my mindset from saver to wise spender?",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1jfl9n8/28_yo_nurse_rent_vs_buy_home_when_can_i_retire/,1742464342.0,Huge_Pool305,1jfl9n8,advice_seeking
financialindependence,buy vs rent,"Seeking Advice on Housing, Finances, and Next Steps—Buying Condo Cash vs. Renting & Investing","**Body:**

Hey everyone,

I’d love some outside perspectives on my financial and life situation. I’m 30M, a full-time law student in my final year, and I have no family or friends in my life—just my girlfriend. I’ll be graduating in a year and plan to start my own business. Admittedly, I’m not very financially literate, and I know there are probably better ways to invest my capital, but the only thing I’ve really done so far is put it into a GIC.

Here’s where I stand financially:

* **Liquid capital:** \~$480K in a GIC earning 3.05%

* **Real estate:** I own a commercial office unit outright, which used to generate $1,000/month net. The lease recently ended, and I’m trying to re-rent it.

* **Car:** Owned outright

* **Current housing:** Just returned to Toronto from a 3-month trip to Southeast Asia. Sold all my belongings before leaving. I’ve been struggling to secure a rental despite an 840+ credit score, strong bank statements, and references. I was looking at a 1-year lease around $2,200/month but am now considering a cheaper $1,400/month shared unit near a university with parking and utilities included.

For the past two years, I’ve been wanting to buy a property. Initially, I was looking at condos (1-bed, parking, North York area) but found dealing with real estate agents and mortgage brokers frustrating. I also considered waiting a year and saving while the market cools, hoping to buy a townhouse later with a mortgage, possibly renting out part of it to offset costs.

However, now that I’m back, I’m feeling tempted to just **buy a condo outright in cash** (around $450K). I know it’s not the best idea to put all my eggs in one basket, but I’m **so tired** of renting, dealing with roommates, and going through the mortgage/agent/bank process. I’d rather just cut through all that and secure a place to live with peace of mind.

I know a condo isn’t the best investment, and at one point, I viewed real-estate as a wealth-building tool. But at this point, I see my residence as **just that—a place to live, not a money-making asset**. I’m confident I’ll make money in the future through my business, so I’m not relying on my home to generate returns.

Still, I can’t shake the feeling that I might be making an emotional decision rather than a rational one. I’d love to hear some objective perspectives—what would you do in my position? Are there smarter ways I could invest my capital?",8,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1irqgb3/seeking_advice_on_housing_finances_and_next/,1739815946.0,Sufficient_Insect812,1irqgb3,advice_seeking
financialindependence,buy vs rent,"Swedish FIRE Journey -- 24 years worth of data on how to study, work and invest in a high-tax country, graphs inside","Hi all,

As a different view from high-income / US-centric examples, I will chip in with a story from a high-tax country, Sweden. 44M, engineer, single. What I want from this post is to share insights from another country and a long-term-ish FIRE perspective.

This is an update to a post I did five years ago: [https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/eqfzxl/swedish\_fire\_journey\_19\_years\_worth\_of\_data\_on/](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/eqfzxl/swedish_fire_journey_19_years_worth_of_data_on/)

**General:** Consumer prices way up, hence FIRE target also increased. Uncertainty has become the new normal.

I work in tech, but now with project management, earning approx $87k/y gross, $59k/y net. Job satisfaction is drastically worse because of this role, being close to the FI target makes it even worse mentally. Too much politics and stress, too much Excel and Powerpoint, not enough meaningful contributions to society. Same story as I see on these subreddits frequently.

**Key numbers:** NW $1150k in after-tax accounts (+$500k since last update), and $1700k including retirement accounts (accessible at 55y/64y, for tax reasons the optimal withdrawal period is from 69 years of age).

I have been tracking my finances since 2001, so it is interesting to see the ripples during good and bad times. I rent for now but am open to buying a small place. My savings rate sits at around 45-52%, and I maintain a light leverage of about 5% on my after-tax investments (at 3% interest). My equity exposure is 103% of my NW (so a bit on the risky side to be sure).

Target NW range has increased from $1M to $1.2M-$1.4M. At a conservative 3% net WR, this would give me a monthly spend of about $3000-$3500. My current actual spend averages at $2600/m so there is a buffer built in to this ""FIRE budget"". I think it is a fair number, a bit higher than median net salary so definitely livable. Note that for example out of pocket health care costs are low in Sweden -- maximum of $145/yr for hospital visits and $290/yr for medicine. As I grow older, now suddenly the money in the retirement accounts also become more real -- in a RE situation, it could potentially be enough to have my after-tax pot be a bridge from today until 69 years of age, as the retirement payouts should be good enough to live on from that age. This should really allow for a higher withdrawal rate as well, but this is what I work with for now.

**A couple of graphs to look at:**

Graph 1: [Net income vs expenses, 2001 to 2024](https://i.postimg.cc/MpzNtGK7/g1-income-v-expenses.jpg)

Graph 2: [Net worth (assets + debt), monthly, 2001 to may 2025, with comments on market events.](https://i.postimg.cc/6Q3SJ1ZT/g2-nw-monthly.jpg)

Graph 3: [Net worth including retirement accounts, yearly, 2001 to 2024.](https://i.postimg.cc/7ZXcRyfp/g3-nw-retire.jpg)

Technically I should be done if I include my retirement assets in the calculation, and with a less than satisfactory job I \_should\_ pull the plug -- but at the moment I'd rather try to fix that situation or find a more rewarding occupation, perhaps part time or something. I have given myself one more year to decide...

**Let's compare the situation in the US and Sweden, with some Sweden-specific info:** The FIRE calculation is different here. Net income for professionals is lower than in the US as the direct taxes are much higher (and salaries more compressed/lower), both on income and on consumption. I would likely have 2x or 3x net income in the US in my current role, \_but\_ considering that I am rapidly cooling off to the idea of working in technical management, that option is not there to chase.

For capital gains, though, we have a tax-advantaged account called ""ISK"" which is a decent option to a Roth IRA, but with a low yearly tax (0.89% in 2025 on the full amount in the account) and in exchange no CGT/tax on dividend income. During accumulation this is the recommended way to save. During withdrawal, a regular account with 30% CGT might be better as you will have a new (high) cost basis when exiting from the ISK and the realized capital gains will be small during withdrawal. In addition, property taxes are very low (capped at $1k/year), and there is no gift tax, inheritance tax, or wealth tax.

Sweden has a HCOL, but also some weird special cases, such as a regulated rental market. My rent was $680/m at my last update five years ago, and has since risen to $780/m. Owner-occupied housing is expensive as in many parts of Europe, with a price of about $350k-$400k for a decent-sized home. The buy vs rent calculation is in favor of renting for me but could change in the future. I still don't expect total housing costs to be too large going forward, which gives some stability to the monthly budget. The rental market works opposite to how it should in this regulated environment, as you want to stick around in your rent-controlled apartment \_if you get one\_, which in turn means that there are very long queues to get the most attractive rental apartments (about 7-15 years in my town) -- which is the opposite of what you want (renting should be a flexible option available quickly).

Another major difference to be aware of is that there is generally less of a need to have a large emergency fund for relatively common situations (sickness, unemployment), as this is taken care of by social insurance programs and ""collective agreements"" (terms of employment). I'd get 80% of my salary if unemployed or sick, for several months before the level is reduced. I covered health insurance needs above, max approx $445 per year out of pocket. Higher education is free as well for EU citizens, so one of the classic life hacks is to get your free education and move to a country with higher graduate salaries (like the US). Daycare is cheap and subsidized, there are generous benefits for parents, etc. 

Also the regular retirement system is self-balancing and looks solvent, you get some parts of it from the government pension system (PAYGO, but with a buffer and with automatic balancing) but a very important and large part from your occupational pension (applies to about 90% of employees) -- these accounts put together currently hold a balance of $550k for me, and if I start to withdraw them at the optimal age (69y for tax reasons), they should allow me to sustain a $3000-$3500 withdrawal at that time (in real numbers of course) given another 25 years of growth.

I find it interesting to understand differences between countries and paths to FIRE, so please feel free to ask if more details are wanted.

I am also interested if someone can poke holes in my numbers and assumptions. Too conservative? Too low expenses? Etc.

Have a great day,",191,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1kkt7ka/swedish_fire_journey_24_years_worth_of_data_on/,1747058353.0,zaladin,1kkt7ka,not_advice_seeking
financialindependence,buy vs rent,2nd Update: FIRE journey in Brazil (32F),"‎I finally feel like providing an update. This is my third post on this, the previous update was 3 years ago and you can read it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/s/f9xF6UgSjQ).


‎
‎So many things have changed the past three years. I'm thankful and feel lucky that the changes have been positive. Below are some of the most important changes in chronological order:


‎
‎•.(07/2022) - Got a promotion and salary increase. Went from R$44,045 yearly to R$59,985. I learned a great lesson from this on advocating for myself as they originally were only going to increase my salary to R$50,520.70 and I was able to argue for myself.


‎
‎• (09/2022) - Moved out of the slums to a nice neighborhood. A friend of a friend owned the apartment and agreed to rent to me at ⅓ of the normal rent price. Increased my housing costs from R$500 to R$1200, but was worth it for the much needed QOL improvement and with the new salary, I was able to comfortably afford it and still save.


‎
‎•(04/2024) - Bought an apartment. My salary was now R$72,148. It's a 1br apartment in a condo building next to the one I was renting. The apartment was R$218,000, R$66,000 down payment, R$152,000 borrowed from the bank and my mortgage is at 7,66%/year for 35 years. The interest rate is low, considering that the rate in the market at the time was over 10% and I got the lower rate through the government housing program MCMV (Minha Casa, Minha Vida). The apartment is beautiful, well maintained and mostly furnished. I was able to move in as is without having to make any improvements or renovations or buy anything at all. Love it.


‎
‎•07/2024 - quit my job with nothing lined up. Culmination of many years of mental health struggles which worsened in 2023 as the urge to quit my job became physical and I had to go back to my meds to keep working. I was having daily, repetitive and obsessive thoughts calculating how long I would be able to survive on my savings if I followed my urges to quit my job and just do nothing for a while. Finally pulled the plug and did it just after buying an apartment and with nothing concrete lined up. I hadn't used all my savings for down payment so I had enough to last me for two years of unemployment. Did nothing for 6 months, it was amazing and my obsessive thoughts are gone. 


‎
‎I thought it would take me months to get a new job so I started looking in November and got a job in December to begin working January 2025.


‎
‎2025


‎
‎I'm in a new industry. Was previously in immigration and now working for an american SAAS company. Below is the new breakdown of salary, benefits and expenses:
‎


‎Salary and financial benefits 

‎• Gross salary: R$97,882/year - R$7343/month (yearly salary calculations for Brazil is monthly salary  x 13.33 because we earn an extra salary in December and additional ⅓ during vacation)

‎• Liquid salary: R$74,648/year - R$5600/month

‎• WFH allowance: R$500/month 

‎• Food allowance: R$1800/month 
‎


‎Company pays fully for health and dental insurance so only deductions are income tax and social security. I'm in the highest tax bracket. I receive the WFH allowance in cash but the Food allowance is on a card that can only be used in places that sell food.
‎


‎Monthly expenses

‎• Mortgage: R$1379

‎• Condo fees: R$500

‎• Utilities: R$350

‎• Medication: R$100

‎• Subscriptions: R$25

‎• Extra mortgage payment: R$3000
‎


‎I currently have R$70,000 in government bonds and am focused on paying off the apartment as quickly as possible. I did wrestle with the whole paying off early vs investing but decided to pay it off early, that's what I decided was better for me.
‎


‎The way I think of it is that my current R$70,000 will last me 1 year and 8 months without a job. Once the apartment is paid off, it will last me 3 years instead and that's a good incentive.
‎


‎ With the extra payments from the past 6 months, I currently owe R$127,287 on my mortgage and 21 years and 3 months left to pay. If I continue this way, it will be paid off by the end of 2027. 
‎


‎That's my update. Until next time.


Editing to add that I cannot talk about my mortgage without mentioning that R$15k of my down payment came from my FGTS and starting next month, my mortgage payment will go from the R$1379 above to R$942 because I applied to have it subsidized by the FGTS.

FGTS is a fund that companies must contribute to on their employee's behalf. It's a percentage of the employee's salary but paid by the company so not deducted from the employee's salary. Employees can only access the money in the fund in very limited and specific situations like being laid off, a disaster, retirement, death, terminal illnesses and buying a residence, subsidizing mortgage payments or making extra payments on mortgage.

Someone also mentioned adding my net worth over time. I did that in the post 3 years ago but I'm currently in the negative due to the mortgage so didn't want to add it. 

Basically my current net worth is -R$57,287 (127,287 - 70,000).",59,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1m7748m/2nd_update_fire_journey_in_brazil_32f/,1753271384.0,FImaybenoRE,1m7748m,not_advice_seeking
financialindependence,buy vs rent,"[Military FIRE] 8 Years In, $122K Bonus Coming — Real Estate, Pension, or Early Exit Strategy?","Hey all,  
I’m an active-duty O-3E (cyber) hitting 8 years of service this September, and I’ve been working hard to position myself for financial independence. I’m under the Blended Retirement System (BRS) and stuck between two solid (but very different) options:

* Stay in for 20 years and collect the pension + lifetime healthcare
* Exit around 10–12 years if I build enough passive/semi-passive income through real estate and investments

I’ve leveraged the military system to the max:

* Completed 3 master’s degrees (MBA, IT Management, Cybersecurity, earned a RE Salesperson license in my spare time) + TS CI/Poly.
* Earned 20+ certs (CISSP, PMP, COR III, FAC PM, etc.)
* Managed complex federal IT & cyber projects
* If I got out now, I could easily land a $250K+ job, but I value the pension/healthcare stability — especially if I can build parallel income streams in real estate

In 2025, I’ll receive $122K in bonus money (Cyber Retention + BRS Continuation Pay), and I’m trying to figure out the best way to use it to further my FI journey without becoming a full-time landlord.

# 💵 Financial Snapshot

* **Primary Property:** $900K SFH with VA loan
   * \~$766K loan @ 4.74%
   * Monthly PITI: \~$4,800
   * House hacking currently 3 Rooms reigns 4,700 and 4 will bump me to 5,600-5,900 (varying on room size, etc) monthly) Tenants pay utilities.
   * Strong STR potential (3 en suite bedrooms), but **county limits STR days/year**
* **TSP:** \~$53K
   * Considering a **TSP loan (\~$25K)** to pay down mortgage principal, then repay myself and repeat
* **Brokerage:** \~$85K
   * Long-term holdings; not planning to touch unless strategic
* **Cash:** \~$42K
   * Mix of savings + rental income reserves
* **Bonus (2025):** $122K (taxed \~26%)

(Edited): Additional background - Married both 6 figs income earners who own each a property. I house hack one with a room available for myself should I need to drive to work from am much closer proximity while I reside with my wife 95% of the month at her residence.  Her Salary is around 160k + Sales commission private sector with a 15 Fix rate property at 2.4% interest rate at around 350k condo we reside in. 

# 🔁 What I’m Weighing:

1. **Use the bonus to pay down the mortgage** or improve equity
2. **Refinance to conventional** (if rates drop), then recast to reduce PITI
3. **Buy another VA-eligible house** in a more affordable, STR-friendly market — house hack 1 year, then rent
4. **Invest in remote turnkey STR or LTR** with property management
5. **Utilize STR tax strategy**: Material participation makes STRs active income → better W-2 deductions (depreciation, travel, etc.)
6. **Sit on the cash** and wait for 2026+ opportunities
7. Explore **REITs or syndications** for full passivity

# 🔍 What Would You Do If You Were Me?

* Is staying to 20 worth it vs. walking away at 10–12 with cash flow and credentials?
* Is **Airbnb STR tax strategy** worth the setup and systems if I’m aiming to offset W-2 income?
* Have you seen success with **TSP loans to accelerate mortgage equity?**
* Would you go for **another VA loan house hack** or go all-in on a remote STR?
* Should I create an entity (if applicable) to mitigate tax burden due to high W-2 dual income earners?

I’d love feedback from anyone who FIRE’d through real estate, weighed pension vs. freedom, or navigated this mid-career pivot. Feel free to drop a comment or DM — I’m here to build this out smart, not rushed.

financialindependence,buy vs rent,Determining Real Estate vs Stocks,"Hey everyone, I'm in a bit of a paralysis by analysis dilemma and could use some advice. My net worth is in the mid-six figures, with about 95% invested in index funds and the remaining 5% in cash. I’m a high earner and regularly buy more shares every week, while maxing out all available retirement accounts.

I’m on track to receive a bonus check of roughly $300k, which will be around $175k after taxes. I’m considering using this bonus as a large down payment on a rental property. The main appeal is that it would help ensure some cash flow, even in today's tough market where finding cash flow-positive properties can be challenging. Plus, diversifying into real estate feels like a smart move.

On the other hand, I'm also aware of the opportunity cost of not lump summing this money into index funds, which has been my primary investment strategy to date.

Is diversifying into real estate worth the opportunity loss? I know the FI community can screw towards stocks, but what would you do in my situation? Would you go for the rental property, or stick with the index funds? Any insights or advice would be greatly appreciated.

For context, I am extremely lucky to have very low rent, $1,000/mo for a single family which won’t be changing anytime soon, and have zero debt.

TLDR: Mid-six figure net worth, 95% in index funds, zero debt, low rent. Receiving $175k after-tax bonus debating between using it as a down payment on a rental property for diversification and cash flow or lump summing it into index funds.

A median house in our city is selling for \~$550k. When it comes to financial decisions, we don't purchase the cheapest - we look for underappreciated items of decent quality (think - unpopular color patterns, used stuff off craigslist, houses that need work, books in bulk off ebay, etc). While we price compare across a few websites, we don't spend too much time trying to find the best deal.

**TLDR:**

**The average cost has been stable at \~$2,500 per month or \~$30,000 per year.**

Trends:

* Childcare costs stay about the same year over year until school starts. There is no free pre-K in our district, but it will be different for some of ya'll.
* Shopping costs are going down by about 25% every year. I expect this decline to stop once school starts.
* Activities started going up after 2 years of age, and will probably stay at the current level.
* Babysitter needs are down after 3 years of age as it's possible to take the kid around much more. Also, I was unemployed for about 6 months in 2023, which allowed me to spend more time with the kid.

Overall, the decline in some costs (doctors, shopping) is offset by an increase in activities, and the cost year over year is surprisingly stable.

FAQs and answers to yearly repeating comments:

* *""Your costs are so high because you outsource raising your kid! I spend nothing because I have a stay-at-home spouse and grandparents help from time to time.* ""
   * I am happy that you have help. To calculate the monetary value of that help, you can convert the time your spouse/relatives spend on your child into a monthly amount and come back with that number for a discussion.
* *""Your daycare seems cheap!""*
   * Yes, I know. Other daycares in the area are $1,900-$2,200 per month. We are lucky to have great quality at a low price.
* *""Your daycare is so expensive!""*
   * Please check the prices. Unless you are in a remote area, $1500/month is pretty low.
* *""What do you get from daycare?""*
   * They take care of the child during the working hours, from 730am to 530pm. They provide education, classes, and ample outside space and activities. They also provide snacks, lunch, and breakfast. They have licensed and certified caretakers that know what they are doing.

financialindependence,afford a house,"Laid off, using the time to go to grad school. Any suggestions? (37M, Single, $1.4 MM NW)","Hi All, long time listener, first time caller

Earlier this year I was rather predictably laid off from a volatile tech start-up.  I say predictably as our management had given us honest assessments of our companies not so good finances, and with the overall global picture, I knew the company was in trouble.

I have decided to use this opportunity to go back to grad school in person full time, as I have a pretty comfortable financial cushion for the moment.  My grad school tuition is covered by the GI bill, which also include a reasonable monthly stipend while I am taking classes.

Current picture:

Assets:

Equities, Taxable Brokerage - $1,183,858

HYSA - $29,954

Checking - $52,592

401K, Trad - $67,717

TSP, Roth - $103,872

Total - $1,437,995

I'm a bit concerned about the imbalance between taxable and others, and one question I have is whether a year or two with relatively very low income can help me rebalance effeciently.

Spending:

Rent - $400 Monthly (includes utilities and internet)

Other - $2000 

Income:

Monthly Allowance - $1,900 starting in September

I have been pretty good about keeping my spending down without overly categorizing it, so I don't have much info on what I actually spend money on.  Part of Financial independence to me is to be able to live mostly the way I want to without tracking every dollar.  My rent situation is living in a friend's guest house, and I contribute to the upkeep to have such an unrealistic rent number (most comparable studios are $800-900 in the area I live)

I know by the CURRENT numbers, my assets easily cover my spending on a permanent basis, but I'm not planning on living in a guest house for the rest of my life, probably just while I'm in school.

Major goals / concerns moving forward are obviously:

Full FIRE Target: $2.5 MM with a paid off house.  While I'm not certain I will ever spend this much in reality, I'd like to have wiggle room to account for kids, as I know family vacations can be expensive, and I don't want to end up raising kids on a shoestring budget.

Healthcare.  This one may be less of a concern, as I may join the Navy reserve and be eligible for Tricare at a very reasonable premium.  If not though, I'm not sure if it makes more sense to look into ACA coverage or take my school's coverage at $2,800 a year.

Home purchase.  I may be moving to a higher cost of living city after school, so I'd like to be able to afford $600,000-$800,000 for a good house.  I've always been a renter in my life, so this part is a bit of an enigma to me.  Certainly I'll run the numbers in any case.

financialindependence,afford a house,Buying a house for the first time in retirement,"I am thinking about buying a house for the first time post-retirement.  Pretty much all of the house-buying financial advice out there, however, is not directed toward someone who has FIRE-ed.  So I'm wondering if you all can give thoughts on a couple of questions.

1. Should I be getting a mortgage?  I have enough to pay cash outright, but I'm not sure how the financial pros and cons weigh out.  On the pro-morgage side, it allows me to keep my money in the stock market longer, and I would get a mortgage interest tax deduction.  However, the tax deduction is probably not worth that much in retirement, since income is relatively low.  On the anti-mortgage side, I would avoid paying mortgage interest.  I'm not sure how this balances out for a person in retirement.
2. How much should I be willing to spend as a percentage of my net worth?  If you're not retired, some people say your mortgage should be 25-30% of your gross income.  Others say you can afford to buy a house that is 5 times your annual income. Since income is low in retirement, these rules don't seem applicable.  Should I be trying to keep my mortgage payment at 25-30% of my withdrawal rate?  This doesn't really seem right, either, because a good proportion of my mortgage payment is going toward increasing my net worth.  It's not a pure expense.  Or should I aim for a percentage of my investment portfolio?

Edit: The other negative of paying cash I have been thinking about is that it will require me to sell a lot of stock to make the payment.  That is going to have an immediate and large capital gains tax consequence.",37,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1l1oxqd/buying_a_house_for_the_first_time_in_retirement/,1748887301.0,_djdadmouth_,1l1oxqd,advice_seeking
financialindependence,afford a house,"Is it possible to FIRE with a decent quality of life if you're not a high earner, but very frugal?","I often lurk the financial subs, and I see that most people frequenting them are in the higher tax brackets than I, but their savings level is very low. I'm curious how far I can get by frugalness alone.

I'm 26, and I make $47k per year, before taxes. I have no degree that would afford me a better-paying job, and to be honest, I have neither the passion for any of the particular fields that would pay better, nor the motivation to actually go to college.

My ultimate goal is to buy a house/property that would cost about $600k.

By year's end, I will have over $75k in savings. I save a significant portion of my money. Year to date, I have so far saved 63% of my income, and this is after taking a month off of work to get married, go on vacation, get an airbnb, etc. 

I have zero debt. I pay $500/mo for rent, + perhaps $320/mo or so on other required expenses, such as food, utilities, car gas, etc. I started a Roth IRA two years ago, and I will max it out every Jan 1st going forward. At current spending and income levels, I save $21-24k per year, depending on outlier variables.

financialindependence,first home,"I'm about to experience the power of FU money, and I'm surprised at how I'm feeling about it","I've been very fortunate in my career over the past 5 years. I was doing well, both financially and mentally, enjoying my career. The pay was good, I kept to 40 hours a week, and the work was mostly stress-free. It was around this time that my wife and I discovered the FIRE movement, and we dove right in. We've kept our standard of living modest while I rose surprisingly quickly through the ranks in the office. We live in a moderate cost of living area and I was earning approximately $100k a year 5 years ago, and that quickly turned into $310k a year. My wife has maintained her salary of around $80k a year and is happy with what she does.

I've been in my most elevated role for about two years. While I was initially excited about the new challenge (and the new salary), my attitude quickly shifted. I went from 40 hours a week to oftentimes 80. I've been travelling throughout the year, being away from my family for months every year. The stress started to mount. I gained 20 lbs., I slept less, and I worried more. Even when I wasn't working, my mind was consumed with work. All of this came to a head this last Thursday while I was travelling for work, and I experienced my first panic attack. My hands trembled so hard that I couldn't type, my heart felt like it was going to explode, I was sweating heavily, and I froze in place. It took everything I had to physically move and find a quiet spot where I could be alone and try to collect myself. I came to the realization in that moment that my job was going to kill me unless I made an immediate change.

When I got back to my hotel room Thursday night, I started to think about leaving my company, taking a step or two down, or both. On our current path, we only have around 3-4 years left before we hit our FI target. The thought of extending that our a year or two while I make a reduced salary popped in my head, and I immediately started to feel better. My wife and I have enough stowed away that I can be out of work for a few months while I recover. I realized that the power was in my hands to make the change I need for myself, my wife, and our daughter. It's been difficult to be a good husband and a good father if I'm never with them, physically or emotionally.

The level of empowerment I've felt since last Thursday has been remarkable. From someone who has some difficulties admitting they need help and who does not feel comfortable making major decisions quickly, the power of FU money has seemingly taken those doubts and discomforts away. I never would have believed I could take such a hit to my income or make such a dramatic change and feel the way I do, but for the first time in years, my future has never felt brighter. I need to be a good husband for my wife, and not just a provider. I need to be a good father for my daughter, and not a stranger who stares into nothingness in the rare hours he's home.

I'm meeting with my manager on Monday to tell her I need a change. I'm going to tell her that I need to take a step or two down, or leave the company if there isn't another role for me. If she can find a less senior role with less stress, I win. If nothing is available and I choose to leave the company, I win. Knowing I'll step into this conversation without a way to lose is a wonderful feeling.

financialindependence,first home,"Turned 34 today, and just hit 100k in retirement savings!","Just hit a massive personal goal. I know I am pretty far behind the curve, but I finally reached 100k total in my Roth+403b. 

Now that I've accomplished this milestone, was hoping to get any advice/wisdom from those further down the road. Here's my very brief situation:

* Dual income, currently own our home (\~400k) with 30 year 3.2% fixed mortgage
* Both still have student debt, but I'll have PSLF after 10 years from state job, so not too worried
* Some credit debt
* Maxed 7% pretax retirement, employer matches 8%, and I try my hardest to max my ROTH contributions, (don't always get there).

I'm the first in my (tremendously small) family to start this path, and am trying to create wealth for my family, especially my single mother who poured a lot of effort into me growing up. Want to make sure, at the very least, we can take care of her and keep her with my family later in life, and not be forced so send her to a home.

Aside from the obvious pay down and eliminate credit debt and mitigate student loans, what should be some of my next steps? I'm looking into saving and purchasing another home to add to the portfolio, and managing our first property. I will admit I have seen plenty of writing on the many downsides of managing a property, and don't have much of a network of other property managers to glean info/mentorship...

# Finances

**Income**

* Dividends in Taxable Accounts: $18.3K
* Long Term Capital Gains: $2.2K
* IRA to Roth IRA conversion: $13.0K
* Total AGI: $33.5K

Now that I’m in my 6th year of retirement, my Roth IRA conversion ladder is now accessible and I have an average of \~$12K/year that I can pull out. This will be a very nice inflow of cash as it is becoming harder to find good lots in my taxable account that don’t have a ton of capital gains. Read below to see more about donating securities with capital gains as part of my future plan.

**Anticipated 2024Taxes**

* Federal: <$100
* State: <$400

**Expenses**

[2024 Planned Versus Actual Expenses for u\/hungn3](https://preview.redd.it/g9h74k3r3ree1.png?width=925&format=png&auto=webp&s=4fa47eef46e31f26431f4021de2c1a86bd9f1a5c)

EDIT 1: Apparently I messed up some of the calculations. Here is an updated expenses table: [https://imgur.com/a/e8DNtiX](https://imgur.com/a/e8DNtiX)

Expenses were mostly in line with budget and spending 4.5% more than planned and it was 6.3% more than 2023 spend.

Big(ger) Ticket Purchases

* Trad rack $500
* New Gaming PC $1500
* 4K OLED TV and Sound Bar $1800
* Havasupai permit $450
* Climbing trips $????

In addition to my cash spend, I also got some things without using cash:

* Got my PC with credit card points ($1500)
* Bought a new TV/soundbar  and paid for half ($900) with points.
* Used points for flights and hotels
* My mom paid for a cruise with her including some shore excursions ($2000).\*\*

\*\*I loaned my mom a total of $21K since 2016 for a variety of purposes and of course haven’t charged interest. Her paying for my cruise is her way of “paying me back” for the loan. I was curious to see how much it would have been if I invested the $21K in SP500 at the corresponding times that I loaned her money, and the $21K would be $56K today. I have zero regrets and would loan her the money again in a heartbeat.

**Withdrawal Rate, “Die with Zero”, and Gifting Stocks**

In 2024 I withdrew 2.0% of my net worth. This is also in-line with my 2023 withdrawal rate. Given that it is already a conservative withdrawal rate, and also isn’t accounting for any Social Security which should be \~$2K/month in 2024 dollars or any inheritance money that I will (almost certainly) get, my spending levels are overly conservative. Thinking about how much more impact I can have now, I’ve decided on a couple of things to help people/organizations that I love now, instead of waiting until I die:

**Finance actions for 2025 and going forward:**

* Increase withdrawal rate to 3.0% ($60K/year)
* Use some of that headroom to do more Roth IRA conversions and sell from my taxable account
* Help my sister pay down her house to improve her QOL for her family
* Donate $5K/year in securities to my queer summer camp\*
* Splurge on some “bigger” ticket items for myself

\*I learned that I can donate securities directly to a non profit without having to sell it first. They receive it with a reset tax basis and I don't have to pay capital gains, so it maximizes what I can donate. I currently have WAY too much in unrealized gains that I can't sell very effectively and stay within “optimal” ACA subsidy range, so this is a good way to donate to a cause I love now and have no tax impact. 

# My Retired Life

**Fire Dating Match**

I've matched a number of people on the Fire Dating website and met a few of them in person. One turned into a good friendship and there were a few others that fizzled out. But at the end of this year I met a wonderful person and we've just really been enjoying spending time together. We share a lot of similar values and being them around me brings me a lot of joy. They are currently a travel nurse and hoping to get to Coast Fire in the next 1-2 years and do nursing for 3-6 months a year and spend a significant portion of the rest of their time travelling and going on adventures. We've already got travel plans for 2025 including some backpacking adventures.

**Notable Outdoor Activities**

* Climbed 52 days outside on 175 routes over 216 pitches and 16,000+ feet
* Led 6 trad multi pitches climbs in Yosemite and Lover’s Leap
* Followed Corrugation Corner in Lovers Leap
* Backpacked a total of 16 days including 9 days on the Tahoe Rim Trail
* Took 5 friends to Catacombs Cave at Lava Beds National Monument

**Travel**

* Kalymnos Greece -  3 weeks.
* Adriatic cruise with mom - 2 weeks
* New Orleans for friend's 40th birthday - 1 week
* Red Rocks 2X - 3 weeks total
* Smith Rock - 1 week

**Favorite Media in 2024:**

* Movies: Challengers, National Anthem, The Wild Robot
* TV Shows: X-Men 97, Agatha All Along, Heartstopper
* Video Games: Against the Storm, Cobalt Core, Shogun Showdown
* Board Games: Spirit Island, Ark Nova, Ticket to Ride Legacy

# 2024 Goals and 2025 Plans

**2024 Goals:** 

* FAILED: Travel LESS: I’m hoping to spend at LEAST 180 days at home in 2024
* HALF SUCCESS: Train for and hike the John Muir Trail
* SUCCESS: Climb, backpack, and bike more
* FAILED: Eat healthier - do more home cooking, eat less junk/snack food
* SUCCESS: Travel to Kalymnos and climb for 3 weeks.

I was about 50% on my goals last year. We didn't get permits for the JMT, but we ended up doing 70 miles of the Tahoe Rim Trail.

**2025 Goals**

* Stay at home at least half the year
* Be more consistent about eating healthier and being more active
* Climb, backpack, and bike more
* Read books 1-5 of the Stormlight archive.
* Finish my Spirit Island Challenge - Win with every Spirit against every Level 6 Adversary - 2 Handed solo, avoiding both repeat spirit pairings and intentionally using OP combos

**Notable Planned Trips in 2025**

* US National Jigsaw Championship
* Trip to Brazil
* Various backpacking/camping/climbing trips
* International Climbing Trip in China or Laos

Thanks for reading all the way through and feel free to ask any question and I'll try to answer every one!

# FAQS:

**How is your rent so low?**

I have been both lucky and made conscious choices around tradeoffs. I’ve been in the same place since 2015 and have a 2BR APT outside of the city that I share with one roommate and I take the smaller bedroom. It’s perfectly serviceable, but certainly isn't a fancy new condo. Given how much I am away from home, I find it very hard to justify moving to a more expensive place when this place does the job.

For the “lucky” portion of it, the landlords have been very chill and have kept rents very stable the entire time I’ve been there. Additionally, California recently (2020) passed a state-wide rent control measure that protects all units over 15 years old.

It’s not officially rent control, but it stops landlords from making egregious increases. [The law limits increases to a maximum of 5%+inflation that year.](https://rentboard.berkeleyca.gov/laws-regulations/state-law/ab-1482-california-tenant-protection-act-2019)

**How do you travel so much on such a small budget?**

I do a lot of camping and outdoor activities where I can get campsites for $10-$20/night which can be split between a 2-4 people or get a backpacking permit for $10 and stay in the wilderness for however many days I'd like. I also stay with family and friends often which reduces costs.

I don't do a lot of ""credit card optimization"", but collect points where I can and compare cash versus point use and decide when to use which.

When I stay in hotels, I maximize hotel points where I can and try to have split costs by sharing rooms with friends. For example, when I was climbing in Greece, we stayed at an AirBNB type of place (via Booking.com) for $880 total between me and my friend for 18 nights it was only <$24/person/night.

**How are your health care costs so low?**

There is a lot to say here, but the quick summary is that if you can control your expenses and keep them low when you FIRE, you can leverage the ACA subsidies to benefit you a lot. I have chosen to go with a Silver 73 CSR plan which allows me to have very low premiums, low/no deductibles, and coverage that works for my needs. I am also lucky to be able-bodied, but also put effort into focusing on my health.

If I chose to have lower Roth IRA conversions or sell less stocks, I could have a Premium of $0, but I intentionally increased my MAGI, which led to \~$300 in premiums.",287,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1i846th/winning_the_lottery_fire_dating_match_and_world/,1737641418.0,hungn3,1i846th,not_advice_seeking
financialindependence,first home,"First year after FIRE, a life update and some reflection.","I've now been officially 1 year and several months. Its been quite a trip...

In November of 2023, after working just over 25 years I retired.  I was 46 years young.  I grew up in a blue collar lower income family in a LCOL community.  I was fortunate to have great parents who were incredible role models.   I'm not sure where it came from but I was always curious and wanted to learn as much as I could about how the world works.  This drove me to become a life long learner and so I was able to learn many self taught skills and competencies.

**Temptations from my old life:**  
Recently I was offered an executive role at a top global corporation.  I will admit in the context of the current economic uncertainty I almost took it.  As I was going through the various interview processes, I got a good reminder of the situations, people, and pressures I would have to face.  I recalled all the stress and life energy I would have to expand and also having to do things I was not particularly interested in.  There was much pressure applied from the prospective employer on just what a great opportunity this would be.  After thinking about it seriously, I decided there is almost no amount of money I would take in order to give up my freedom.  So I politely declined the employment offer.  It was an exhilarating experience and great joy, to be free.

I have spent a lot of time catching up on relationships that I had allowed to grow distant.  Its been amazing being able to truly connect and be present with loved ones.  Not all the attempts to reconnect have been successful but I'm still grateful for those I got right.  This is still major work in progress.

Healthcare:  We are using the public market exchange to purchase a bronze healthcare plan which costs a few hundred dollars a month.  We have been life long non smokers and are in relatively good health.

**Kids:**  Last year my 19 year old started his first year in college with a full academic scholarship so our college expenses are almost $0.  Although I had set aside some funds for his attendance, I did not need to tap into those.  The plan is now help him with his first RE purchase once he gets to that stage.  My younger so is in a class A, public school and he continues to do well.

**Stock Market Volatility:**  
I will admit I still watch the market like a hawk, but I do not trade on market news, no matter how good or scary...  When the stock market went down 10%+ recently; There were some days when the portfolio went down by  more than $500K.  I found out, in  real life, having a more than sufficient buffer was a great thing.  I lost almost no sleep.  So the years of one more year syndrome seemed to have been worth it after all.  Especially just from a context of peace of mind.

I did some international and local travel and enjoyed it but sometimes I think the very best place you can be is in your own town, around your own home and having access to your very own bed every day.  I have also done a lot of thinking, planning, gardening, trail walking, learning new technical skills, reading, watching movies and cooking.  My favorite thing now is meditation and mentoring.

Will I work for a corporation again?  Well, with any luck, hopefully never again but never is a long time...

I can truly say, truly the very best things in life, are mostly, free.  :-)

This will probably be a long post, so skip it if you don't feel like it today ;)

# Headspace

By now, the idea of having a job feels like a distant memory. Almost like a bad dream where you wake up not really remembering many details except for a nebulous sense of anxiety. The idea of going back to a desk job, working for someone else, is almost unfathomable at this point.

It’s taken surprisingly long for this feeling to *really* sink in. For a while, I still took the occasional call about some new startup and kept in touch with professional acquaintances out of a vague sense that it wouldn’t hurt to keep the door cracked in case I’d ever need to open it again. Until a few months ago, I still told people that I was on a sabbatical rather than out of the market completely. I even tried to maintain a boundary between productive hours during the day vs. leisure hours in the evening. Somehow, hopping on the PS5 at 10am still felt weirdly degenerate, even though some days that was exactly what I *wanted* to do.

At this point though, I have fully leaned in to this new reality, and it's great. I'm like, the CEO of DGAF these days.

# Finances

Things have obviously worked out really well this year in the financial markets. Spending-wise, I'm on track to exceed my budget a bit, but my portfolio is still up over 10% even after drawing down on it all year. From a sequence of returns risk perspective, I couldn't have asked for better timing.

I probably still check my balances way too often though, haha.

I realized the main thing that was contributing to my low-grade anxiety around finances is a low-interest (2.99%) loan that nevertheless comprises a relatively sizable share of my monthly expenses. I've decided I'm just going to take some money out of the market this year to pay it off, which will significantly reduce my ongoing expenses and get my withdrawal rate going forward into the sub-3% range.

Now that I really, really do not want to be forced to go back to work, I am kind of dead set on making the portfolio bulletproof. I also want it to grow enough in the next 5 years or so to be able to make a decent down payment on a house, so I'm still keeping spend pretty conservative.

# Life in General

Once I got past the novelty, I think the best way to describe life after FI/RE vs. before is that it’s actually fairly similar, except for the obvious difference that one doesn’t involve spending 8-10 hours at work and dealing with all of the attendant frustrations. While I’ve dabbled in some new hobbies, in most cases I've found that the same things I had been doing before have simply expanded to fill much of my time. Instead of reading for 15 minutes as I’m falling asleep in bed, I can read for a few hours if I’m in the mood. Instead of grocery shopping once a week and making 5 monotonous batches of meal prep for the sake of efficiency, I now spend several hours a week trying new recipes and getting small batches of ingredients on the fly. Instead of driving everywhere, I’ll often take public transportation, walk, or ride my bike to get some exercise.

I realized the internet has a tendency to amplify the extraordinary stories: people going on to start successful blogs and podcasts, traveling the world, venturing into entrepreneurship or surprising second careers, etc. Looking at these, it’s easy to imagine that being the default path of your average FIRE adherent. The *right* path, even. For a while, I had this nagging feeling that I was ""failing"" at FIRE somehow. The same ambition and instinct to be productive that enabled me to have a modestly successful career carried over to create some toxic expectations for how I needed to maximize my time, when I really just wanted to chill out and enjoy what life has to offer for a bit.

All that said, I definitely plan to travel a bit more once my wife leaves her current job (hopefully in a couple of years), if only to just be able to spend a couple of months living in different cities where we have clusters of friends. It would be nice to be able to just hang out in a more normal context as opposed to feeling like we need to see 5 different couples over the course of a weekend.

I recently read the book *Die With Zero,* and one of its central premises is that people often end up spending too much time working to accumulate for a retirement where they ultimately only spend a fraction of what has been saved. That excess money represents thousands of hours of wasted life energy that could have instead gone towards gratifying experiences earlier in life. That point really helped validate my decision to pull the plug when I did instead of grinding out a few more years at what was the highest earning period of my life.

Like all things in life, I think you eventually get used to any changes, good or bad, and fall back more or less to your natural emotional set point. Going into it, it felt like life without work would surely be 10x better. The reality is that it's probably actually a bit closer to 10%. (Just to make sure I'm not underselling it too much, note that 2x is still technically closer to 10% than 10x ;)

Of course, I have zero regrets to have worked towards this goal and I feel healthier and happier than I have in a very long time, but time—like money—is just another resource. It's what you ultimately do with it that will define your experience.",301,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1fkv8dj/1_year_into_fire/,1726780191.0,archiv1st,1fkv8dj,not_advice_seeking
financialindependence,down payment savings,"Considering buying a place, is this a bad idea for FIRE?","First, I’ll say I know the numbers favour renting right now. But I can’t shake home ownership as future proofing against costs rising etc. 

I (35M) live in a MCOL city in the US, have a partner but it’s relatively new so buying solo, total comp $315k but may go down to ~$250k once my RSUs run out if I don’t try to find a new job. I went to grad school so I didn’t start earning this kind of money til I was 32. I had a net worth of like 40k two years ago. 

My current rent in an extremely desirable neighbourhood is $2,000 a month for a three bedroom. No in unit laundry. I’m paying probably $800-1,000 under market. 

My SR is 70% right now, 60% over the last three years (break ups expensive lmao). Net worth Broken down:

$163k house down payment fund
$23k IRA 
$71k taxable investments 
$30k EF in HYSA
$197k 401k. 

No debts. 

I’m looking at a place across the street from me. Similar size, 2 bed plus office. Absolutely beautiful turn key apartment. Vintage charm. 10/10 meets all my needs. Condo in a 6 flat. 

But it’s asking $545k (sold for $400k in 2022 with no updates since then, figure that one out). 

Probably go for $575-600k. It’s more than I wanted to spend, i was shopping for more like 3-500k but it’s perfect. For some reason I’m filled with hella anxiety about taking on $4,000/mo payments ($3,000 because property tax is not paid monthly which actually is really good for me because my comp is variable working in tech and I feel more comfortable with 3k a month). 

My main concern is this will decimate my savings rate and is maybe too much house? Right now I max my 401k with backdoor and everything to $70k a year, another 7k in IRA backdoor, then another $60-70k in taxable savings. 

If I bought this place at 6.9% interest and $150k down the plan would be to max all tax advantaged savings and then and remaining $60-70k maybe less once my comp goes down would be straight into extra mortgage payments. 

Bad idea?? Is my anxiety unwarranted? Warranted? Support or tear me to shreds I want it all lol.

financialindependence,down payment savings,Pay Down 6.625% Mortgage Aggressively or Invest? (3-5 Year Time Horizon in Home),"Hi everyone,

Looking for some feedback on whether we should aggressively pay down our mortgage or invest the extra funds. Here's our situation:

* **Us:** Married, 30 years old, living in a medium to high cost of living city.
* **Income:** $270,000 gross annual income.
* **Savings Rate:** Consistently save 50% of our income.
* **Potential Extra Mortgage Payment:** Could allocate at least $4,000/month towards the mortgage. This is after maxing all other accounts.
* **Net Worth (excluding home equity):** $1.3 million
   * Retirement Accounts (401ks, Roth IRAs, HSAs): \~$720,000
   * Brokerage Accounts: \~$520,000
   * Cash: $60,000
* **Mortgage Details:**
   * Interest Rate: 6.625%
   * Loan Type: 15-year
   * Current Balance: \~$280,543
* **Home Value (conservative estimate):** \~$420,000
* **Future Plans for Home:** This is *not* our forever home. We are planning to start a family soon and can see ourselves selling and moving in the next **3-5 years**.

**The Core Question:** Given our 6.625% mortgage rate and relatively short (3-5 year) timeline in this home, does it make more sense to:

1. **Aggressively pay down the mortgage** with the extra \~$4,000+/month?
2. **Invest that money** in the market instead?

We're trying to figure out the smartest move, especially considering the interest rate and the likelihood of selling in the not-too-distant future.

Thanks in advance for your insights!",9,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1l11zn4/pay_down_6625_mortgage_aggressively_or_invest_35/,1748817318.0,TheMustachianWay,1l11zn4,advice_seeking
financialindependence,down payment savings,$1.1m from $60k job for 16 years ,"Created a throwaway for this as very few know my status. 

I was lucky a few times on this journey. 

I had a career in IT and started at $32k. My income quickly rose to $60k. I had that income for 13 years except for the last 6 months when I got a fixed contract for $60k. 

I didn’t have any debt out of school thanks to family. The only bad debt I took on was buying a new $22k car. But I paid it off quickly. 

My first bit of luck was my family. Not only did they pay for my schooling, they taught me to be smart with money. 

The second bit of luck was the housing market wasn’t totally insane yet. I saved up a down payment and got a 1 bedroom apartment with a $90k mortgage. I hated the idea of paying interest, so I aggressively paid down the mortgage. 

A few years later I found a much better location. I sold my apartment and used the equity to buy the new place. I actually loss money on my first apartment but the way I think about it, it came out to be about the same as paying rent to a landlord. 

For my second place I had a $117k mortgage. 

My hobbies were cheap so all I did was put my money into additional mortgage payments. Fast forward a few years and I aggressively paid it off in under 5 years. 

A few years go by, I start putting money into the stock market. Nothing interesting. Ups and downs. 

The next big event was the opportunity to move in with my family. This meant free rent but it also freed up the capital that was in my apartment. 

I sold my place when the market was high. Gained about $100k. After all said and done my net worth was about $300k. 

I put all of it into the stock market. And this was another bit of luck. 

I bought some spacs and some etfs. Loss a lot of money on most of it, except for NPA which is now ASTS. I bought NPA when it was around $10 and sold when it was over $30. But if you look at the price history you will see it went as low as $2. I rode through all of it. 

I quit my job when ASTS was in the gutter. I was taking a break thinking I would need to get another job but then ASTS started taking off. I sold out of it and locked in index funds. 

How did $300k become $1.1m, especially when only a part of it was in NPA? It didn’t just buy NPA shares, I also bought warrants. Those returned over 400%. 

I got lucky. 

But what was in my control was my spend. My low spend, helped me pay off my car/mortgage quickly. In total I paid very little in interest. ",252,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/1g00bw6/11m_from_60k_job_for_16_years/,1728503295.0,throwasaladtogether,1g00bw6,not_advice_seeking

Hello All,

I wanted to post my family’s current financial situation to understand how I’m tracking towards retirement and what I need to do to improve. I ask you to please be nice if you are helpful enough to respond with advice. I am a first-generation college graduate who grew up in a paycheck-to-paycheck household, so financial independence was something I thought I could not achieve. By posting this, I hope to better understand what I need to do to own a home and retire by \~55.

I’m currently 29 years old with a stay-at-home wife and a healthy 3-month-old son. I currently make \~$190k in a corporate M&A role and expect to be making this amount at a minimum for the foreseeable future. We currently live in an apartment in Houston, TX and can afford to pay \~2.7k in living expenses per month. I max out my 401k, Roth IRA and HSA, while contributing \~5k annually to a post-tax investment account. I also max out my wife’s Roth since she began to stay at home. Additionally, my Wife and I are debt free.

1.      As you look at the makeup of our assets, what do I need to be doing better to make sure early retirement is possible? Additionally, does anyone have helpful information on how to calculate if it’s worth it to rollover your 401k?

2.      When it comes to owning a home, my main point of apprehension is the opportunity costs of putting a lump-sum into a down payment rather than investing it in the market. I do not view a house as an investment, but rather as a living expense. As of now I see owning a home in Houston or Dallas, with a good school district as a move that will make us house poor but please let me know if I’m thinking about this wrong.

 I’ll greatly appreciate anyone who takes the time to give me and my family advice.

Debt,invest $1000,100k in CC debt and seems to have no hope,"We were doing ok financially until last year, I’m the bread winner and my husband typically manages the money, we had new baby and one thing leads to the other we got careless, the maternity leave and all we screwed up now we are over 100k in CC debt.

I have about 86k under mine name currently paying the minimum. My husband has 37k under his and some of them are already in collection. We decided to put our expenses together and I don’t see a way out of this. 

I make about 174k with two jobs, husband tries to do door dash or Uber with maybe additional $1000 a month if we are lucky. 
My mortgage is only $2400 ish but bc we are behind on our property tax my bank helped us out and paid our property tax so currently paying $4200/month until Oct of this year it will drop to $3200.

We have a car payment of $1000 but that’s leased and it would be too expensive to break the lease right now. Car insurance and house insurance adds about $300/month. We also I have student loan currently on IDR paying about $700 between the two of us. I just talked with my CC company and they gave me an option of debt management where I’ll be paying 0-3% on majority of my credit card but that still totals to $1245 a month. Between the two jobs we can only manage my debt not his. 

I had a brief conversation with a bankruptcy attorney and because of what I make we probably don’t qualify for chapter 7 may need to file ch 13. Which they say it’s probably going to be a high monthly payment. I’m still waiting to discuss the details with them to see if I can pass the means test. We hope to not sell our house as the average rent in my area is around the same as mortgages. Obviously it’d help if my husband can work more, but his hands are tied from taking care of our 1 year old and we can’t afford daycare. 

All being said idk what else we can do to help if anyone has any suggestions of remote jobs or ways to earn more income? 


Edit: a lot people has questioned how we incurred the debt and how ignorant I was not knowing. Well I don’t want to spill out my sorrow on internet for random stranger’s judgment. Long story short, I have great credit prior to this. I paid my credit card in full my oldest card was 18 years. I’ve only opened 3 credit card on my own, my partner has opened 7 more using my ssn without my knowledge. He was doing stock trading prior and we have around 20k in assets. I have 100k in a retirement account that I don’t really touch. He moves money from joint account to different savings account under his name which I thought was used for saving but really to pay for cc. I only found out because I looked at that 100k retirement account to make some changes to my investment. To my horror it was all gone, he has withdrawn the account under penalty; then he came clean. Wouldn’t tell me where all the money was spending on, but I had some idea (his drinking problem which we had multiple arguments) wether my marriage is worth saving or leave him I want to save for another Reddit post. But should I have been more careful? Yes. I loved him, so I trusted him with this, I already feel back stabbed and betrayed.

Debt,invest $1000,$600k in debt - wage garnishment seems like a real strategy,"Hi all, I've been facing all sorts of trouble last 3 years. I am based in NY.

* In total I have about $550k in debt (long story, relatively high earner but not consistent, some missteps in investments + ex-employer filing baseless lawsuit left me without income for a bit, excuse to not pay my severance)
* Sequentially dealing with lawsuits from creditors as them come, some resolved.
* $350k in student loan
* $200-$250k in consumer debt + medical bills
* Total of 6 consumer debt lawsuits, I've settled 2 (basically dealing with it as it comes)
* I have no assets other than my computer, which I use for work.

I am not a Chapter 7 candidate (lower end of mid-6 figure job, variable)

I considered Chapter 13, but mainly it doesn't deal with student loans.

It's starting to legit seem like (after few lawyer consultation) that wage garnishment is legitimately the best solution, as student loan takes priority, and rest of the creditors get crumbs based afterwards.

Because of my high income, student loan repayment thinks my monthly should be higher than it is, because it doesn't consider consumer debt / lawsuits, so I am in a funny position where income-based repayment + debt repayment of any plan is WAY TOO HIGH (and I can't afford the amount) compared to the wage garnishment strategy.

\-----

Bottom line is that it's weird but a lot of my creditors think it's weird I am asking for wage garnishment. One actually never collected when I asked for wage garnishment (is it complicated from collections standpoint?)  **Wage garnishment seems like it's the only ""plan"" that guarantees a global cap.**

Can anyone share their experiences and advice on this as a real strategy instead of ""talk to your lawyer"" since lawyers (I've had 5 over last 3 years) have just been taking money to recommend Chapter 13 but not giving real advice for my situation (I guess they aren't used to clients wanting wage garnishment to be the solution / they can't take fees)?

\-----

P.S. Approx calculations:

* *Chapter 7*: Not eligible
* *Chapter 13*: Stupidly expects \~$6000-$8000 a month (approx, I cannot afford this)
* *Wage Garnishment*: Capped at $2000-2400 (if I don't change jobs)
   * $1000 goes to student loans (there's 30x minimum wage limit)
   * $1300 is split between creditors
   * Will have some wiggle room to save up and offer ever few months: ""hey creditor, do you want to settle for 30% bulk sum instead of this 15 year plan?""

  
P.S.S. I've found out that I have 9 months of forebearance time left (which my previous loan servicer, denied I had, now transferred to Nelnet) which is nice.

Debt,invest $1000,Received summons for 7k debt from Velocity investments,"In August 2022 I took out a personal loan through Upstart to help with my financial struggles. In hindsight it was a dumb decision, but I was in my early 20’s and struggling taking care of three young children on little income in the midst of a pandemic. The loan was for $7200, and according to the paperwork my last payment was $200 on 10/8/2024. They say I owe $7078.73, which seems high after 2 years of paying but I’m assuming it’s the interest that accrued from nonpayment. The debt was sold to Velocity Investments, and I received a summons that says I have 20 days to respond to the complaint. I currently am an unmarried stay at home mom, but I do own my home, so I’m worried they may be able to come after that or my car? Both are required to provide for my family, but with little in my bank account and no wages to garnish, I’m not sure what exactly happens? 

I considered bankruptcy but again worry about my property. Besides the personal loan, I owe approximately $600 to Chase Bank for a credit card. They’ve been trying to collect but have not yet sued. I’m paying on a washer and dryer which has about $1200 remaining, and a Hyla with $2100 remaining. My car, home, and other payments are all up to date. I have around $29,000 in student loan debt, but am currently enrolled. I get roughly $1000 every 10-11 weeks. I don’t know if bankruptcy would be worse than telling the judge that I’m not working, I’m in school, and I can’t pay. Either way I’m paranoid of losing my house and not being able to provide for my kids.

A. Move back in with my parents, losing a majority of the stuff i would have to toss or leave behind. but get to keep my DVC contract AND do things the ""right way"" in my mind by actually paying off debt, but losing my independence.

B. as stated, I made 42k a year, i fall under the ""mean"" in NC and likely am qualified for chapter 7, if i file chapter 7 and start with a fresh slate, i can easily afford my current apartment, and that means anything my wife doesn't take when she leaves i can keep, i don't have to pay to move again, but i would lose any ""assets"" that i have including the dvc which i'd likely sell before the chapter 7 so i could use the money for things like fixing my car and getting ahead on rent

now if the option was between being homeless or not the DVC would be gone instantly, but im not sure if the better option is to eat the chapter 7, or eat the loss of independence, housing keeps going up, i have a decent job that guarantees 40 hours and OT during peak season. if i move back in with my parents it would be at least 2-3 years before the debt is paid off in any significant amount and i might not be able to move out again as easily. i really like the apartment, but id also really like to keep a 50 year contract investment",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Debt/comments/1h3de92/bankruptcy_or_moving_in_with_parents/,1732975982.0,Vaellian1020,1h3de92,advice_seeking
Debt,invest $1000,Struggling with debt and could use advice moving forward,"Hello all,

This is my first time I’ve ever posted but I’ve seen very helpful advice on this thread and wanted to see if there was some helpful insights available for my current debt management. 

I poorly managed my credit cards and expenses in my early 20s and it resulted in me having to take out two personal loans to pay off the debts. In addition, I have a car loan, student loans, and some remaining credit card balances. 

Please see below:

Student Loans:

Balance: $16,607
Monthly Minimum: $115.84

Credit Cards:
APR: 29.99%
Balance: $7500
Monthly Minimum: Variable ~ $300

Total Balance is $85,000 and monthly minimums are about $2000.00. 

In addition I pay $1000-$1500 for a shared living space and utilities. 

I’m budgeting my standard of living and it approximately $1000 per month. 

I work a Full-Time sales job that brings in approximately $75,000 in annual gross income. After tax I’m able to pay my monthly minimum expenses and usually have a minimal amount to additionally allocate to my credit cards. 

I do not have any savings or investments at this time. 
 
I would appreciate any assistance and/or advice on next steps. I’m in a serious relationship but am prepared to take on a second job. I’m also debating to attempt another personal loan to consolidate as much of this as possible at a lower APR but my credit is 710 and I’m not sure if that would be advisable. 

Apologies for the length of this post and I appreciate you if you read all the way to this point.

Debt,invest $1000,"Need advice on how to go about paying off my cc debt, preparing to buy home in the next year, and how to go about tackling huge student loan debt ","To lay the foundation of my situation 

-I’m 26 years old and about 4 years out of college. I have about 150k student loan debt in a private loans not including another 30k in federal loans. I now have about 22k in cc debt after knocking down a few thousand this summer. 

-I’ve flipped cars since I was in college and I also have my real estate license and make decent money using that doing 1099 work for asset management companies where the more work I accept the more money I make. The car game gave me an entrepreneurial mindset and at an early age understood the idea of streams of income, business ownership, flipping money and having money work for you as opposed to working hours for a 2 week check. Ive grown to have this vision of success as make as much money as I can doing whatever I can until I’m making so much I can hopefully start buying businesses or getting into other ventures  that are more passive. Pretty much make a lot of money so I can spend more money and take more risks to make more money. If this sounds undisciplined and over optimistic it’s because I am and that’s kind of part of why I’m drowning in debt. I’m confident in my ability to make the money as I have streams of income with no ceiling and the ambition to go get it but I think this debt is hindering me from hitting the levels I wanna hit.

-I just started working 9-5 about a year ago focusing on getting a remote position so I can still have time to do my other hustles. I’ve been at my company now about 6 months and they pay me about 4k a month after tax and benefits. With my real estate work I bring in between 4-6k a month and with the cars about 1-2k a month. 
Since I started this job in February I’ve been taking home atleast 10k a month on good months around 12-13k a month. I don’t pay any taxes on the cars but the real estate stuff we’ll get to. 

-My expenses are $1550 in rent. I pay about a $1000 minimum in cc minimum payments. I’ve been paying $1000 a month cash to my online university as I’m pursuing an MBA (Part of that is that I’ve been running from the full student loan payments that are gonna be atleast 2k a month). No car note just car insurance, all those other random bills and expenses probably come out to around $6-700/month. 

One of the main things I want advice on is my desire to buy a duplex next summer. I’m tired of paying $1600 a month to nothing when I can put that towards an asset. The area I’m looking to buy in is a part of north Philly that’s being gentrified, I’m looking at the duplex as a good long term investment that I’ll be happy I went with for a first property 10-15 years down the road. The thing is obviously for me to get approved for these 5-600k duplexes with all this debt will be hard. I can flip my money in cars to pay off the cc debt within the next 8-10 months I’m not worried about that. But when I’m done school all that student loan debt and those monthly payments will hurt my buying power. 

 Also I haven’t filed taxes for ‘22 and ‘23. Now remember I said I was 1099 worker in real estate. That ‘22 year I made about 74k in 1099s that I was hoping to try to write off most of it and avoid that huge tax bill, but when it comes to getting approved for the house I’ll need to show income. The 23 year I only made about 30-40k in 1099s and about 20k on a W2. When I file for 24 I estimate my 1099s will show about 45-55k and my w2 will show my $60k salary. 

Is there a way for me to have my taxes show I make money without me getting fucked on my tax bills?

Can I write off most of 22 and show more on 23 and 24 so those will be the most recent 2 years?

What’s a realistic tax bill I can expect and what do the payment plan options look like?

I’m looking for general life advice on how I can improve my overall situation, what would you do if you were me and your life was set up this way, what am I doing right, what am I doing wrong, and what do I need to tweak that will take me to the next level.

Debt,invest $1000,Covered in debt at 26y have no idea how to get out,"European, 26yo. I live with some relatives and don’t have any expenses for food or housing but my monthly salary is just 1000€ and for reasons I won’t get into, there’s no chance of a promotion or getting a new job. No saved or invested money. I’ve always had a bit of a spending spending habit but never any debt. That was up to some months ago, when my father appeared (he's been semi-absent for years). He's a gambler drowning in debt. He told me he was in deep trouble and needed 30k ASAP. I was weak and stupid, didn't manage to say no. So we went around to a few banks until we found one that somehow agreed to a 30k loan with a monthly payment of 500€, due for 10 total years. With interest it’ll total 50k€.
My dad promised he’d cover the monthly payments until he got a payout he’d use to pay off the loan ""all at once, or twice"", sparing us the extra interest. But things have only gotten worse for him and now he can’t keep up with the monthly payments. (Useless to say, it hit hard like a cold shower the realisation that he probably won't be even able to pay for it altogether as originally agreed)
I’m left spending every cent of my monthly paycheck, and I’m terrified that’s how it’ll be for the next ten years.
Is there anything I can do other than just pray?

Debt,invest $1000,Need advice on paying off car loan! Help!,"Need Advice 

I am seeking advice from people online. I have 14.2k in a car loan with 5.4% interest rate. I want to pay this off. I have 18k in the bank. I also invest 1680 a month into my TSP. I was wondering what you all thought about the following ways of shifting money to pay off my debt. 

1. Shift the full 1680 from TSP to loan until paid off. This would result in about 12 months of no TSP investing. 

2. Shift part of TSP to loan. I would decrease amount of TSP to about 1000 a month and use the other 680 to make my monthly car payment 1000 to pay off loan twice as fast. 

3. Creat a high yield bond investing account with Betterment ~5.62% yield. Using the per month profit from the account to add to my monthly loan payment. For example, if I put in 10k to my bond investing I get ~560 profit from the bond account and use that as an increased monthly payment (~160 more a month paid down than normal)

Debt,invest $1000,Debt collections while approaching SOL,"Hi all, need some guidance! Thanks in advance. 

So I took out a $1000 loan from Upstart in Sept. 2021 and paid part of it. I hit some difficulties, missed a few payments and then moved and completely forgot about it. The loan was sold to a debt collection company, Velocity investments, and then sold to a law firm. The law firm finally tracked down my new address and delivered a court summons to it a few weeks ago.

I contacted them, set a payment plan and received the contract to sign in the mail. I was gearing up to sign and pay but then did some research here - I live in NYC, where the SOL is three years. I’m about two weeks out from the three year mark now. 

I have two questions -  a) can I just argue the SOL deadline in court and win? And, more importantly, b) how would that affect my credit? Currently the debt shows as potentially negative on my report. I asked the associate for the law firm on the phone if I paid in full, would they be able to strike it from my report. They said no. If I go the route of arguing the SOL in court, would it also be struck entirely from my report on those grounds?

Any advice appreciated! Thanks ",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Debt/comments/1f9tgfp/debt_collections_while_approaching_sol/,1725560450.0,InitialAd677,1f9tgfp,advice_seeking
Debt,small windfall,The PayPal Business Cashback Credit Card Concerto Servicing Solution Debacle.,"Consider this a catch-all post for anyone to air their greivances and offer advice. 

I just got this card in the Summer of ‘23 to make some major business purchases. I applied, was approved quickly for a limit of $7,500. 
Almost as soon as I got the card, their advertised cashback was slashed from 3% to 1%.  So even tho I nearly filled my limit within a few weeks with some acquisitions for my self-employed business I got next to nothing in rewards. 

I made all my minimum payments on time and was working my balance down over the last year. Only making small purchases like a couple of cheap monthly subscriptions. I actually got notice this past September that one of my subscriptions was about to lapse so I checked out the card. Sure enough, I got the impression that my limit had been lowered. So I made my monthly payment early with a little extra. But of course, I misunderstood the situation at first. 

What had actually happened was that this card was cancelled and everyone who was enrolled had their accounts closed as of September 2024. In my view, this is a breach of contract with a credit card company: if I am making my payments in a timely fashion then I’m in good standing, and if they can’t keep their business solvent because of overleveraged debt it becomes their problem, not mine. So, I stopped making payments.

This isn’t my first rodeo with debt and PayPal. In 2016 or so, I had a very healthy PayPal Credit account which I made regular payments on. At some point, they decided I had too much debt and my account was frozen. I called in to get my account active, and the CSR I spoke to lost her temper with me while we were negotiating and she hung up after cussing me out. I called back, and spoke to a manager and they cancelled my entire debt. This was nearly 10k. A few years later, I got a tax bill stating that I had to include the debt as income on my taxes - but it was not a big deal as I had losses that year which covered it.  

During the Pandemic I made the mistake of not taking a TPE loan, as it seemed to be too good to be true. I ended up getting behind on some bills in June of 2020 and Citi closed a card and Synchrony closed all the accounts I had with them simultaneously. A couple of years later, I had a significant windfall and paid off all those accounts, except the Citi one because they took me to civil court and we settled on about 60% of the debt.  

So my best experience is to wait these things out. I did not make a further payment after September, then in October or November I received notice that the debt was now handled by Servicing Solutions. I followed the links to email and read some users posts on here and it looks like SS was asking for a lot of sensitive information and is a company with questionable business practices. 

I’ve gotten a few emails from Servicing Solutions then on December 9th I got this email:  

“Dear ;8^p~
 
 
This is your opportunity to save on your Business Cashback Mastercard. We want to resolve this matter as quickly as possible so we are proposing the following settlement offer:
 
•        One lump sum of 70% of your current balance, due and payable on or before December 13, 2024. This is a 30% reduction of your current balance and would result in the largest saving for you.
 
Or:
 
•        3 equal installment payments of 80% of your current balance, beginning (no later than) December 13, 2024 and continuing on the due date of each succeeding month. This would result in savings of approximately 20% of your current balance.
 
NOTE: If you fail to make each monthly payment on time, the terms of the settlement will be null and void and you will be responsible for the full amount owed.
 
If you do not call our office on or before December 13, 2024 to accept this one time deal, this offer will become null and void. We are not obligated to renew this offer.“ 

Then yesterday, I got this email: 


“Dear ;8^p~
 
 
This is your opportunity to save on your Business Cashback Mastercard. We want to resolve this matter as quickly as possible so we are proposing the following settlement offer:
 
•        One lump sum of 60% of your current balance, due and payable on or before 12/27/2024. This is a 40% reduction of your current balance and would result in the largest saving for you.

At this point, I’m just considering waiting until they make an offer asking for only 5% of the total debt. Or I’m waiting to see if there is a class action lawsuit that gets the debt cancelled for breach of contract on Concerto’s part. 

So far, I’ve had nothing reported to credit agencies. My question for those who’ve had to wrassle with Servicing Solutions is how long before they actually report - or do they ever - and how far down do they end up whittling the bill?

P.S. If I had paid the full bill, or made an installment agreement on the full amount I would be pissed. In part, I do think there needs to be a lawsuit or an investigation into Concerto's practices. Servicing Solutions is clearly insolvent on this debt and desperate to get people to pay anything. Unless advised otherwise, I think it’s best to keep waiting it out.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Debt/comments/1hhnwt2/the_paypal_business_cashback_credit_card_concerto/,1734594616.0,CuervoCoyote,1hhnwt2,advice_seeking
Debt,what to do with extra money,"My husband and I make more than enough money on paper, but our debt is drowning us.","My husband and I make approximately $130k gross pay each year, which sounds like a lot on paper, but after all of our monthly payments we are just scraping by. We have no savings and neither of us have been able to open up any kind of 401K or retirement plan. My husband is 38 and I am 29. Not including the remaining balance on our mortgage, we have just over $34k in debt between credit cards, student loans, and remaining balance on a high interest car loan. Last week my car's breaks started to feel off and my dashboard is lighting up like a Christmas tree and I'm terrified for what the mechanic is going to tell me when I take it in tomorrow morning. We can't afford another car payment every month, we just can't do it! I've been trying to pay off debt using the snowball method and making slightly larger payments on the credit card with the lowest balance and paying slightly higher than minimum payments on everything else and it's been slowly working, but it just doesn't feel like enough. We were also going to try to start paying an extra $100 each month towards the principle of my husband's car loan to pay it off in 1.5 years rather than the 3 years remaining on the loan term since the interest rate is 28%, but if I have to get a new car there's no chance! We don't have enough saved for me to buy a car in a private sale outright, and a loan on a car that would suit our family needs (1 year old son) would be minimum $400/month. As it stands we don't have to worry about putting food on the table or our utilities being shut off, but if a new car is needed we likely will cross into that territory.

I've been looking into debt relief or consolidation and everything just feels so scammy and I don't know who to trust. IF there's anyone I can trust. I get targeted ads for debt relief that claim they can knock down your debt by 40% and I just can't believe that that's true. I've looked into getting a second job remote at night after my son goes to sleep but all of the jobs I'm finding that are remote with flexible part-time hours are shady companies or those ones where you complete surveys for $0.25 a piece and I just don't know what to do.

Does anybody have any advice for me? Do I just keep playing the long game and paying off debt slowly and hopefully in 10 years be free of it? Are there any reputable companies that offer debt relief or consolidation? Any advice is appreciated!

Debt,what to do with extra money,"UPDATE: My husband and I make more than enough money on paper, but our debt is drowning us.","Wow. To say that I am overwhelmed by the sheer number of responses I received would be an understatement. 200 replies and I want to make sure I say that I read every single one and have taken each one to heart. I know that I wasn't able to provide all of the information initially asked for when I created the post, so for those interested I wanted to post an update as there were way too many comments to answer each person individually.

First, to address some common misconceptions or assumptions that I noticed in the comments.

1. The debt that I have accrued is broken up as follows: $8000 CC debt, $7000 car loan, $19000 student loans. It is not all credit card debt.

2. Our income increased to 130k net about 6 months ago and the debt has not risen since the increase in income. We are not continuing to accrue more debt, we are just struggling to pay off what is already there, but the amount owed HAS decreased gradually over the last few months, just not as quickly as I would like. We are not using the credit cards and have no intention to change that.

3. One redditor suggested I was spending the money on expenses like getting my hair or nails done, spending on new clothing, or other luxuries which is not true. I might get my hair cut once every six months and more often than not cut it myself and I also cut my husband's and my son's hair. I don't get my nails done or even wear makeup. When we buy clothing, on the rare occasions that we do, we buy secondhand at thrift stores or goodwills, even for my son.

4. I understand putting extra towards my mortgage sounds counter-intuitive with the other high-interest loans. I have had others advise me to take out a home-equity line of credit to pay off the other loans at a lower interest rate but since we've only had the house for just over a year I didn't think we'd have enough equity to be eligible. My thought process was that if we pay extra towards the mortgage principle for a while we will gain equity faster and may become eligible for that type of loan. Clearly my thinking was skewed, I'm genuinely trying to learn.

5. We cannot reasonably function on 1 car, my husband and I have opposite work schedules (I work 7:30am-4:00pm and he works 2:45pm-10:45pm). Both of us require vehicles to get to work, biking is not an option, and there is no public transportation in my area. To only have one car would require regular charges to Uber/Lyft and would more than likely increase our monthly expenses. It is also not an option to change jobs. I have a degree in education and have a teaching job that pays more than others in the area (60k/year) and is paying for me to finish an additional certification that hopefully will get me a 5k raise, but if I would leave not only would I be unlikely to find another job in my field that pays as much, I would also owe back the 2k in education expenses they've paid for. My husband does not have a degree and his job is one of the highest paying no-experience-needed jobs in the area, so if he goes anywhere he will more than certainly take a pay cut and he also holds our health insurance. I could qualify for insurance through my job but it's about 3x as much as what we are currently paying.

6. I realize that I said ""new car"" in my last post, but it was never my intention to get a new car. ""New"" was just meant to mean new to us, but I was always looking at used cars. Yes I was looking at SUVs/minivans, but after hearing it spelled out I felt very stupid not considering just using a beater for a couple years and reevaluating later. Everyone in my life has always purchased cars as an investment with the intention to keep them a minimum of 10 years and that's just the mindset that I've had as well. I'm trying to fix that.

To address the other comments and provide additional information, you all are right to say that we were not properly educated on financial literacy. Neither of us knew how to properly set up a budget and a big part of the reason I made my original post is because we are trying to learn and make better choices for ourselves and our family, so for those who commented because they really wanted to help educate and provide meaningful advice we greatly appreciate it. I knew what I was in for when posting on a public forum such as this, so even the harsh comments were appreciated and helped me wake up and start to make active steps to get ahead of this problem.

I get it, refinance the auto loan! We talked about refinancing it a while ago and received advice from someone in our life who we trusted who said we'd be better off paying it off as fast as possible than to refinance into a new loan. At that time we were in a better position to dedicate more of our income to paying loans off, but as soon as our situation changed we should have just gone with our guts. We are looking into getting a loan with one of our local credit unions at a lower interest rate as soon as we can. I plan on also discussing the possibility of a personal loan to pay off the CCs as well but I want to do more research on my own before deciding on that.

My husband and I sat down last night and pored through our bills from May to see where exactly our money was going. We had some unexpected bills come up during that month such as having to pay a plumber to fix a burst pipe and a window AC unit to replace one that crapped out on us (no central air), so the numbers are a little skewed compared to normal but we also calculated the average of what we would be paying each month in essentials only and are trying to budget out the rest. Last month we spent $7.2k in essentials but somehow spent $2.4k in nonessentials, so you all were right when you said the spending was out of control. We're already cutting a lot of those extra things out. If anyone is willing to provide feedback on it we would appreciate it.

Income: $7,622.54 - for anyone who was looking at my comments on the last post, my husband works a factory job and his income is based on production so it varies. This May there was a mix of good paychecks and not so great ones, so this number does feel like a good representation of what we make on average each month. I make salary so my income is consistent. This amount is after health insurance is deducted.

Essential Bills: $4,541 - Mortgage: 1730, Car: 380, Car Insurance: 140, Water: 50 (bill comes quarterly so this is averaged per month), Electricity: 115, Gas: 300 (this month and next month, then will not need to pay until cold weather comes around), Daycare: 860, Expected Medical: 80, Cell Phone: 202, Internet: 105, Student Loans: 300 (paying extra because I have an owed balance, once I am caught up will go to the bare bones minimum), CC Minimum Payments: 279, Trash Removal: 32

To budget the \~3000 ""surplus"" after essentials are paid, this is what we have decided to allot for budgeting the other essentials and reflect roughly what was spent last month with some minor adjustments: 

Groceries: 775 (this includes toiletries, paper products, my husband's e-cig fluid, diapers, and cat necessities), Gas: 200, Subscriptions: 50, Clothes: 100

After that, there is approximately 1800 left which we are planning on splitting up as follows: $500 goes into a savings account until we have 3 months of necessities saved, $200 available for ""eating out,"" $250 for each person as a discretionary fund for non-essentials (I plan on using the majority if not all of mine to contribute to debt payments), $300 towards the lowest-balance CC until it's paid off, $300 as wiggle room in case I find out later that I missed something.

I'm going to start keeping track of everything, checking the banking app every night and charting everything into each category to spot overspending or if we start to approach our monthly maximum too early so we can reassess exactly what's going on. My husband is on board with all this, but we'll see how things go in practice. I have a feeling we'll be having many more conversations before we both can change our mindsets, but we're taking the first steps.

For anybody curious, I categorized all of our unessential purchases into categories, DoorDash (all me) was 145.84, my husband's work food (there's vending machines that he often gets snacks from) was 52.53, Unknown misc. purchases under $10 (gas station drinks or snack, etc) was 101.64, eating out was 400.15 (this is higher than normal, there were some holidays that we were celebrating, it's normally less than half that), amazon purchases 528.19, atm withdrawals 230, misc. shopping 473.98, phone purchases (app store/games) 121.83, husband (birthday) 291.85, and subscriptions 80.49. 

EDITED TO ADD: I am getting a lot of comments from people thinking that the above numbers are a part of our new budget. These are what we are cutting out from last month’s expenses. We know none of these are essentials! There were a lot of people asking about what the money was going towards in my last post and I was just providing context. 

I have already uninstalled doordash and we will factor in any necessary Amazon purchases (son's baby wipes, iron supplements, house maintenance like fridge water filters, etc) into grocery or personal expenditures. Any categories that have leftover amounts at the end of the month will be applied to CC payments. My plan is to try and stick to this until the end of July and then reassess once we've had a full month using this method.

Also to add, I got unfortunate news on my car. I got the news I was sadly expecting, it's not just my brakes but the transmission is shot and the CAT converter(?) needs to be replaced to pass inspection which is up at the end of next month. All together, even with used parts, I'm looking at $5k minimum in repairs which we just don't have. The brakes have been fixed enough for the car to be safe to drive and the plan is to use it until the end of next month and put aside as much as possible to try and get our hands on a beater car. We have about 1k now, I am receiving about 1k from my sign-on bonus on Friday, and using the $500 allotted to saving for this month and next month we're hoping to find something that will run for the next 2-3 years until we can get in a better spot. My mom has 2 cars (1 is a luxury car that she doesn't drive in the winter months) and if absolutely necessary I might ask her to borrow her practical car until we can finish saving what we need. It's a bit of a complicated history so I'm wary asking favors but it'll depend on what's for sale in the area. Looking now, even high mileage old sedans are running about 4k in my area. But rest assured, we are looking to purchase something outright and not finance anything.

Thank you again to anyone who is still reading and to all who have given me advice, it's not falling on deaf ears. We are also going to look into alternative cell phone plans as it's much higher than I thought. I believe my husband's phone is still being paid off so I'm going to look into the payoff amount on that and we'll go from there. There are only 2 internet companies that service my area and believe it or not the one we have is the cheaper one. I am thinking about calling them because they're always hosting promotional sales for new clients and see if they can lower our bill temporarily to keep us as customers. If anyone has any other questions, please let me know, but I think this encompasses most of what was asked.",204,https://www.reddit.com/r/Debt/comments/1l90uf5/update_my_husband_and_i_make_more_than_enough/,1749667944.0,M1ss_Angel,1l90uf5,advice_seeking
Debt,what to do with extra money,"Tired of living paycheck to paycheck, I’m barely getting by.","I (26M) am just barely scraping by, but I feel like it’s becoming harder and harder to stay afloat. I have about $37k in credit card debt/ personal loans and can only make the minimum payments right now. I have a decent income, about $130k/year. I’ve been cutting expenses when and where I can, but it doesn’t seem to help much. I live in a city where housing isn’t the cheapest and I live in a 1 bedroom apartment close to my work. I have 2 vehicles, one is fully paid off and I’m still paying on the other, but I’m upside down so I cannot sell it. I’m very serious about my credit, so delinquencies and bankruptcy are out of the question. I have considered getting a personal loan to hold onto as a cushion and just making the payments with the funds from that while I find a second job to help me get ahead. Is this a bad idea? What other options do I have?

Edit: For those saying to sell the paid off car, it’s not worth much. It’s an old pickup truck with way too many miles, but it’s been incredibly useful to me

OneMain personal loan- $10,012 
Affirm- $3,700 (I typically don’t like to do stuff like this, but I’ve had some life challenges come up in 2025 that warranted the “buy now pay later” approach).

About $800-$1,000 per month goes towards groceries and gas. I rarely ever eat out. 

I also own a small business, which is in hibernation until I free up some debt. Last year I made ~$30k in revenue which I had to count towards my total income. It is seasonal, so I can only count on it bringing in extra money between late August to the end of October. Gross pay from my primary job was about $100k, take home about $70k after taxes, insurance, and 401k.

Debt,what to do with extra money,"Just finished paying off 31k of debt, here's what I learned...","I just made the final payment and am now completely consumer debt free. 

31k in 15 months. 

There were a few huge road bumps along the way: partner was laid off and I took on more bills in a HCOL area, had to replace tires, my freelance computer aged out of updates and I had to replace it, etc - but it is finally done. It was not easy at all, but knowing I don't have a chokehold of debt lingering and stealing my future was worth every sacrifice.

Here's the huge things I learned along the way that can hopefully help someone else:

1. In my opinion, the Ramsey Snowball Method is far superior to the Avalanche. Starting with the smallest debts, and achieving victory after victory tackling them, gave me the courage to look at the largest ones. I gave up numerous times when starting with the largest balance (that had the highest APR because the balance sat for so long), and just accepted my forever indebted fate. There were no victories in sight when I paid off a chunk of the large balance, then watched the number shoot back up after the month was over with interest. With high debt, you NEED those small victories to give you the strength to take on the biggest one.

2. 0% balance transfers when approaching the big bad last debt. Once my credit got to a good enough spot where I could get a REALLY good high balance offer for a 0% balance transfer, I transferred my highest debt over for a 4% fee, rather than 25% APR. I knew it would take months to pay off, to the point where the 4% fee was the better offer anyways, so it REALLY worked out in the end. Had 12 months to tackle the last very high debt card, which gave me the grace time to tackle the emergencies I had pop up with cash, rather than credit, as well. 

3. BUDGETING. Get a cheap budgeting planner and USE IT EVERY DAY. Write down your income coming in for the month, all of your subscriptions/bills/debt/etc - figure out how much money you have to work with after all the essential bill are paid, then build your groceries and extra debt payments around it! Use it like you are balancing a checkbook, highlight the purchases that weren't essential to figure out where the money bleed is coming from.

4. Mental health check. Figure out what happened to get here to prevent ever getting back to it. To get the the point I did (then coast in the 31k for years), my ex was a very cruel shopping addict, he maxed out his own cards at around 50k to 60k, then used my cards to buy high price items while I was also taking care of all bills and couldn't pay it down. After I left, I stupidly ignored the debt, added to it, paid the minimum, etc. I realized after a few years, I was just abusing myself by letting myself rot in it, and decided to get therapy to gain the courage to change my life. High debt almost always goes hand in hand with mental health issues, find help to get yourself through this.

5. Sacrificing one year of luxuries (new clothes, take out, subscriptions, amazon purchases, concerts, nights out, etc) will open your life to EVERY possibility. I had SEVERE FOMO during these 15 months, especially when it came to 'once in a life' concerts, not 'treating myself after hard times', etc - but after a little over ONE YEAR, with a few slip ups, I can do everything without being terrified I can't afford my rent or make a minimum payment. I wore the same clothes, sewed up holes, wore out shoes, and realized life didn't reduce in quality if I missed out on a clothes sale. In fact, the clothes that were popular last year, aren't even in style this year, so it's not like I was missing out on much!

6. Freedom App - I got the freedom app to block online shopping during times I knew I was mentally trained to make stupid choices. It broke so many habits, and gave me more peace of mind. 

7. Progress on debt will build confidence, which will open SO many doors. When you start making REAL progress on your debt, you will get inspired to make an even bigger impact on your debt - I took on extra freelance jobs, that gave me extra skills that applied to my full time job, that made me accomplish more at work, that got me a HUGE promotion and raise. It is weird how powerful your mind gets when it has confidence. Achieving goals on what seemed like an impossible task can open the entire world to you. AS A BONUS: The less debt you have, the more choices and risks you can make. The world will open up to you. Just keep going.

8. Realizing there is no easy path, you just have to do the work. There is no magic path. Debt consolidation, for the most part, are run by predatory companies. No one will fix your debt, except you. It's like losing weight, it is very easy to put on, but hard to take off - except this time the only assistance, like Ozempic, is fixing your life situation to stop the money bleed, budget to find the extra money areas, fight for a  higher income, gain confidence, and when you get close to the end, utilizing that 0% balance transfer to give yourself a breath to tackle the rest. 

  
Knowing the journey is over feels strangely anti-climatic. There was no big rush of joy or celebration, but I have noticed I can finally breath again. My day has felt peaceful. It is March 1st and I haven't felt  the IBS inducing fear that I might not have enough for rent, which I felt for many many years. I know exactly how much I have and I know none of it is going to credit companies anymore.

Debt,what to do with extra money,I’m drowning in credit card debt and loans,"I’ve got myself in quite a pickle here. Without giving too much detail, I now have $25,000 in credit card debt across 5 cards, two of which are maxed out, almost 3. I co-signed a personal loan for someone who may not be able to afford to pay it anymore, still owes about $14,000 on that. I have a car loan I still owe about $16,000 on. I owe money to my orthodontist for my braces I’m still in, about $4,300. And I fully regret deciding to purchase a timeshare last year, for which I still owe an unknown amount probably around $12,000. 

I’m absolutely drowning. I can make all my payments successfully and have never missed or been late on any payment ever. But I’m not gaining any traction. I’m not making a dent into what I owe, the interest rates are incredible and I’m living paycheck to paycheck barely being able to afford groceries. 

I’ve already kicked myself enough and I’ll be selling a lot of my belongings in the coming weeks. Also looking at uber/lyft but then I have to get insurance added for that and I’m not sure it’ll be worth it. A couple hundred bucks a month doesn’t seem like it’ll be worth it, I need thousands of dollars like yesterday. 

The timeshare is charged to a credit card every month, and the card is maxed out after this next payment. The second card that’s maxed out is how my braces are getting paid for (care credit). Braces payment is about $460 a month… they charge me about $1400 every 3 months. Debt consolidation loans would be helpful if I didn’t still have to use those cards. 

I’m just rambling at this point, I’m at a loss. Where do I go from here? I’m tired of buying things I NEED by credit card. I need a way out, I’m drowning in this hole I’ve dug for myself. What can I do to make some extra money. 

EDIT TO ADD: I have a full time job, work at least 40 hours a week and bring home about $640 a week after deductions. I just got a raise about 2 months ago after I passed a state exam for my job but I’m not seeing the difference in practice yet. My minimum payments also increased that month. I rent an apartment with my cat, the rent is stupid cheap, $600 a month. I know the timeshare was an awful idea and I’ve looked into getting rid of it but I don’t have thousands of dollars to spare to hire someone to make it go away. I have about $110 in savings. I have some stocks I don’t really want to touch that are worth about $3,000. I can make the spreadsheet tonight. However tonight priority is listing my belongings for sale. I have 2 pieces of art I want to get rid of, one is worth about $800 and the other about $550. I spent 15 months taking full financial responsibility for someone else, not 100% by choice but that’s what you do when you think you’re in love. That’s why my debt is so high. He went to prison and I’m left here in the dark bottomless pit of debt.

Debt,what to do with extra money,"Sued for $1700, but I have no job","Hello, I’m extremely nervous about this. Since the beginning of this week, I started getting mail about being sued by Discover for $1700. I was dumb and got a credit card and though I did try to keep up with it and payments, I fell off with keeping up. I had a job then, but now I don’t (currently have been job hunting). 

In May I have the court day, but I’m wondering what is even possible options for me. I have no income, I totally would pay it off if I did have the money. For a bit of extra history, I cannot drive nor do I have a car and I live with parents. I’m studying at least, so there’s that. 

I’ve looked at a bit of past posts on here, and usually the amounts are around the $2k+ range… So I don’t think bankruptcy would be wise? I’m all new to this, but I literally have no income right now unless I get lucky with freelance work until I land a job. I don’t know what to do, so any advice is extremely appreciated.

Debt,what to do with extra money,Is it a terrible idea to just ignore medical debt?,"I had a 10 day hospital stay last year, with 2 ER visits 2 ct scans, and an upper scope (thanks ozempic). My insurance covered all but about 4,000 of it. I've seen many random posts on various sites over the years saying people have had success with just not paying and ignoring it. So I have lol. It's been sent to collections at this point and I get a few calls every week, and an occasional text or letter. My phone silences the calls and marks them as spam so they don't bother me. 

My credit score dropped 30 points a few months back from 750 to 720 but I'm back at 736 now. I own a home and make decent money but don't have an extra 4,000 dollars to just throw away (I know that's not what it is but it feels like it). 

My thinking is that if things ever get really serious- I can start begging them for payment plans and reductions or just suck it up and pay whatever's left of it. I'm also choosing to be delulu and imagine a post Trmp world where medical debt is erased and universal health care is a reality, and this debt doesn't matter anymore....I can dream.  

Is this going to bite me in the ass somehow?

Edit: sorry need to clarify- I don't want a payment plan- I genuinely just don't want to pay this at all. I have better things to do with $4000 and I'm 0% concerned about the hospital or any debt collectors missing out on that money. I just don't want to cause any major financial or legal issues that I can't easily get my way out of. Pretty sure I'm just going to ignore it until it goes away or I am forced to deal with to avoid some major penalty 🤷🏼‍♀️",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Debt/comments/1jwche1/is_it_a_terrible_idea_to_just_ignore_medical_debt/,1744329309.0,tiger749,1jwche1,advice_seeking
Debt,what to do with extra money,25 with 27k in debt,"Im in desperate need of advice on how to pay my debts down while working part-time and little extra cash. I was doing great with my apple card until a big purchase, racked up money, put some on citi for their 0% financing for a year, and im still at 1.6 and my apple card it maxed again. Im not super worried about my car payment as much as i am these credit cards with the near 30% interest. What do I pay down first, how much and how often?

\*Full-time is not an option for me. My job is very physically and mentally demanding and my mental health was deteriorating fulltime.. hell, I struggle working 3 days but I cant afford to do another line of work making this pay; I'd be homeless pretty much as my husband cant support us both.

Before I get lectures, yes, Im aware im spending money I dont have. I have bad habits built off money from my life growing up and as I started working as an adult (right off the rip I was never given access to money I worked for. My parents opened credit cards in all mine and my siblings' names when we turned 18 and had no idea. Was lied to and told they 'dont know how to get online banking', and after moving out found out they'd rack up our cards and then use our money from our banks for cushion and payments as they needed. Lied about accessing banks so we couldnt see. I could barely get gas in my own vehicle without getting crap. I didnt have a purchasing issue until after this). Not an excuse but yea, I just dont have healthy habits, im trying to fix it and become debt free. I do own my own home I purchased 2 years ago and NONE of my NEEDed bills like mortgage, power, etc ever go unpaid. No matter how little money I've had the past 6 years of being on my own, I have ALWAYS paid bills to live on time and always make sure that is covered. I now also own animals and they will always be priority as well. I can afford choices I make, Im just not smart about the when or savings.

Debt,what to do with extra money,Should I file Bankruptcy?,"I (26F) have had the worst 3-4 years. Back in 2019 I got my first credit card. It was secured card, $300 balance. Once my credit got to a certain score, they changed my secured card to a regular Visa credit card and the limit went up to $1000. I hardly ever used it, and if I did I was good about paying it off every time. Fast forward 1 year and my credit had jumped almost 30 points, so I applied for another credit card, both through Navy Federal by the way. This second credit card is/was an Amex. Got approved instantly and my limit was $5,000. Long story short, I fell into my bad spending ways and really racked those cards up. 

Secondly, I co-signed for my mom to get a car..worst mistake of my life. At that time I had discussed with her how important my credit was to me and if she couldn’t afford or handle her payments then we did not have to do this. She got a brand new 2020 Passat, that’s just what the financial guy offered and she took it. Not even a full year into being with her on this loan, she was late a payment. I called her freaking out, crying because my credit took a hit. Lost 50 points. 

My mom is a narcissist, she’s never truly cared about anyone other than herself. When I called her to talk to her about it, she got defensive, mad at me as if I shouldn’t be upset that she is ruining my credit. She told me it would never happen again. Well, that’s a lie. Since that point, which was back in 2020, she has accumulated 18 total missed payments on her vehicle which has obviously negatively affected my credit score and payment history. 

Going back to my credit cards, I was doing great making the payments each month, minimum payments but still able to pay it. Until December of last year. I lost my job and had only been able to work the weekends. I bring home anywhere from $200-$400 every couple of weeks so I haven’t been able to even pay my credit cards at this point. I haven’t reached out to them and see if they have a financial hardship plan or anything, because i was enrolled in a debt settlement program that was helping me but couldn’t afford that after losing my job. 

Total I have I think about $35k in debt. This includes my mom’s car. My question is, should I file bankruptcy? I have no idea how else to get her car off my credit otherwise. I’ve tried to call them and see if they would work with me since my credit took a hit and they said i’d need a new co-signer. My credit is less than a 500 at this point. I know I wouldn’t be able to get her car back on my own. I’m lost, I don’t know what to do and feel like I’m drowning. I want to make sure I can get everything paid off, but I can’t afford everything right now. 

Is bankruptcy worth it? I’ve seen get another job etc etc, I have been door dashing and doing what I can to make extra money but it’s just enough to help around the house after my paychecks have paid for MY car payment (which there’s only one left THANK GOD) So idk I’m so lost.

I’ve been part of a debt consolidation program for almost 6 months with multiple credit cards/loans involved. All has gone smoothly till we got to discover.

Discover is trying to sue me for the money I owe them which is about 7k OR pay them 400$ a month on top of what I’m already paying to my other debt which I cannot afford. Everything I read says either try contacting discover myself first to explain my situation and see if we can settle it OR contact a lawyer which I can’t afford right now. Just wanted to see if anyone has any other advice before I call discover? I have till the 31st (3 days) to approve/deny their offer of an extra 400$ a month to them which I already know I can’t afford either that or they’ll try to renegotiate which I’m told it usually goes up or they’ll sue me.

Any suggestions or advice is welcomed!?

Debt,bonus invest,"$40,000 in Credit Card Debt - Embarrassed and Need Advice","Simply put, I'm just over $40,000 in credit card debt. Essentially, we bought a house in this market in June, and we put too much down on it to reach our debt/income ration. Then we have had the process of needing a new car, paying for furniture and other enhancements, medical issues with the kids, and it has all just caught up to us. Not to mention my work hasn't paid out bonuses for the past two quarters because of a system upgrade. Still, that's only about $10K that I will make up. Otherwise, we have put too much into physical things, and we realize that's the first cut. Christmas made this absolutely difficult to not disappoint the kids. I know these are excuses, and I know that's going to be the first step of this.

Point being, I'm stressed and anxious about my situation. We were even thinking about selling the house and downsizing already, but we would probably lose about 30K in that process in closing costs+agent fees+moving/storage fees if we even could sell. It is a new construction neighborhood, so I doubt anyone is clamoring to buy a 6 month old house in the same place they can still buy a brand new one. This was another mistake. We bought the wrong house, and that's my fault too.

I feel like an utter disappointment. I'm considering getting a night or weekend job. That would take me away from my kids for most of my waking hours, but I don't see much of another way.

I am salaried at $72,500 and typically get between $3K-$5K in bonus per quarter.

My Mortgage is $2100 a month.  
My Car Insurance is $280 a month.  
My Car Payment is $630 a month.  
Utilities are about $300 a month.  
Internet is about $80 a month.  
Subscriptions are about $50 a month.

I am trying to make the correct choice for my family here. I was thinking about trying to get a HELOC or personal loan to pay all of it down and stop using the credit card beyond groceries. At least the interest will be significantly less.

Or should I just pay the minimum balances every month and suffer through this interest?

Or should I actually consider selling the house? We would pay a large amount of taxes/fees before the 2-year ownership mark as well. So we may even lose closer to $50K, which would be another failure.

I really just need some advice and options. I feel like I'm either going to lose my mind, my health, or my family over this predicament that I've created for myself.

ADDITIONAL INFO ON THOUGHT PROCESS FOR SELLING THE HOUSE:

Also, I guess I did not explain the thought process for selling the house. We put $265,000 into it. We could sell and probably get back $200,000. Then we could pay off our debt and either rent or look for something shittier for lack of a better word. Prior to my second child and our most recent purchase, we have been fairly good with our investments at the very least. 

ADDITIONAL INFO:

Does it help to know that all the credit card debt is in one place? It’s all on one AMEX card. I just saw they offer a financial relief program, but is this better than what I could find from a debt management program? 

Amex is offering to cut my credit card off during a 48 month payment period @ 9.99% with a monthly payment of $842 with no late fees. If I sell the car, that’s $650 back into this payment plan, and I still get the second source of income to cover the rest and more.

I dont necessarily need to pay off the car right away. It would be nice to have the extra $320 i spend on it a month back to pay towards other debts.

Yes we've cut costs which helps. I also picked up 2 part time gig working events which havent started yet but itll help for sure.. i have a buffer in our checking at around $2k to help offset some of the harder months where unforseen things happen, which i guess you could consider that savings.

2. Would a balance transfer be a good first step with my credit score?
3. Are there any Washington state benefits or relief programs I might qualify for at my age?
4. Is debt consolidation worth considering or should I avoid it?
5. Are there any specific programs for seniors in my situation?

I own my home but have no savings and am not financially savvy.

Any advice on creating a realistic plan to reduce my debt **(especially the credit card)** would be greatly appreciated. I am not too worried about the mortgage, but immediate savings on credit card would be huge.

Debt,getting started investing,Citi Debt sued by Midland (arbitration?),"New login (embarrassed) 

Hello I was hoping to get some advise from the debt experts here. I've been researching for several days now since I received my summons from a process server. The case is being brought by a law firm representing Midland on a Citibank account that was closed last year with a balance of just under 6,000. This is in Oklahoma the summons says it's from creek county district court. 

I called Midland and tried to negotiate they said they can't because they already sent it to the lawyers. 

Next I called the lawyers office and ask them if I can discuss it and avoid court, trying to prevent a judgment or lean on my property and garnishments on my bank account etc.

The only thing they would offer me was payment in full with a couple hundred dollars off. I don't have the money and can't swing that unfortunately. 
I told them I had done some research and asked about a stipulated judgment. 

She asked what I was looking for I said

1. A reduction of the balance of possibly 10 or 20%. 
2. No interest on the judgment in writing.
3.  A covenant not to execute
4. A short grace period of a few days on agreed upon payments. 

She told me their contract with Midland says they cannot offer a stipulated judgment. 

Said no to every one of my requests and said all they can do for me is let me make 169.00 payments for 36mo. And enter an agreed judgement. She also stated in Oklahoma that they automatically put a lien on my property once they get their judgment even in this scenario where I make an agreement with them and start paying. 

So to me it seems like she offered me absolutely nothing. She did try to say it was better because if I was paying they wouldn't file more motions to get into my bank account. 

She also stated when I asked about the interest that Midland is cool and if I'm making payments that they usually don't try and recover the State mandatory interest that they're asking for in the summons. When I asked if I can get that in writing prior to signing an agreement for repayment with them prior to submitting my answer to the summons she said nope. I'm like oh so I just have to take you in midland's word for it huh she said yeah. 

In my research I came across some information about arbitration. So I downloaded the cardmember agreement for that citi card and there is an arbitration clause. 

It does say something about arbitration can't be used in small claims. My summons says district court so I'm not sure if it's small claims or not or if I can request arbitration in my answer.

I have read on here and in several debt forum posts that when faced with a lawsuit brought by a debt buyer like Midland for pennies on the dollar that choosing arbitration will often cost them more money than it's worth to pursue and they will often drop the case. 


1. Is referencing the arbitration clause from my original card member agreement I'm my answer to the summons my best option to get this matter behind me? 

2. Can you guys outline the arbitration process if the law firm decides not to drop the case? 

3. Oklahoma doesn't offer any online or answer forms so I'm still vague on how I should write my answer to the summons requesting arbitration.

4. How do I find out if it's small claims court or not? The summons says district court and it's over 5k could it still be small claims in my state and if so does that mean I can't seek arbitration? 

Any advise is greatly appreciated. I've never been through this before or had any issues with debt. 
 
Thanks for taking the time to read my post I really appreciate it. 
 
Edit: personal situation info 

I'm in my 40's and took a year off to build my house as it's always been a dream of mine to build a house myself like my grandpa did. I spent my savings and did it mortgage free but near the end I ran out of money and ran up some of my cards. Then I got sick and was diagnosed with two major health conditions and have been working on getting better so I can get back to work. I'm able to squeek by each month with the little bit of money I have left but the prospect of a judgment against me a lean against my property I own outright has got me majorly stressed out. I have been looking at my new house as an ace in the hole 
So to speak for getting me back on my feet and or as a possible road to investment capital on a new business venture and I'm worried having a lean on the property through a judgment will make using my homes equity a nightmare.

Debt,getting started investing,100k+ in Debt someone please help. ,"First off I just want to thank you for time on my post. 
I’m a 30 y/o male married w/ 3 kids with 100k+ in debt. I owe 3 business loans to two different providers with weekly payments of $4,500. Yes weekly not monthly. 

Before you go and bash me just know when I started this business I really did not know what I was getting my self into. 
I just had my 3rd child and was working full time doing A/V work. I had a side hustle of selling guns for a local shop. I did it for about a year and it got to the point where I built my own client list. That point I went to apply for my license to sell firearms and everything was going so smoothly. I was getting approvals, I had $$ saved up from my real job and my side hustle to purchase a building , got permits and everything I need to start the business. 

Things were going great for the first year! We were rocking and rolling to the point where I needed help. The year was 2021 and Covid had just taken over the economy and our ship started to sink from there. 

It was one week where I had 3 employees working and we didn’t see a single soul the whole week. I decided to get a business loan out to help keep us afloat and keep my employees. Thinking things were going to get back on their feet anytime soon now. 

As months started to go I started to build traction again and then another slow stunt came and I pulled yet another loan out. Thinking things were going to go great one day … but it never did. 

I needed up firing 2 employees so it was just me and another left at the shop. At this point I’m almost 75k in debt with a full inventory of firearms to get rid of. 
One day I had a near death experience that landed me in the hospital and ER room for almost 2 weeks. The shop was closed and I had hardly income to pay back my loans and my employee. 

I went and got my 3rd loan out and at this point I already knew it was a bad idea but i thought I could flip things around. I partially used that loan to try invest into another business and that ship sank before it could take off. It was  epoxy flooring business. Which didn’t need much upfront cost but equipment. ( Stuck with 10-20k worth of equipment) 

Now I have 3 loans, 2 jobs and 1 goal. To get me out of this debt.  At this point I’m 125k + in debt. 

I never touched my personal credit cards or used any of my personal credit to try and boost my business but I was needing to pull a miracle to get me out of here. I max out on all cards after paying payroll and building payment  one week.

I decide to make business changes and do gun shows and have my employee run the shop to try and boost income. It was running so smooth for 6 months and I thought this was my way out of the hole. Gun shows were going great and it all just went down hill again. 

I sold the shop so I can cut back on expenses and overhead fees and started strictly doing gun shows. Sales at the shows were much better than the shop. I am now doing gun shows almost every single weekend driving up to 20 hrs round trip at times trying to pay these loans off. I’ve been negative almost every week for the last month and it’s gotten to the point where I’m having to ask my wife for my money. As a man that was always able to provide it’s been very hard to ask her for lunch and gas money. I do not want to bring her business into my debt and cause her to close her doors either. She has been running a bakery for the past year and it’s enough to pay for her car and some of our kids expenses. Not enough for our mortgage, my vehicle (just downgraded to lower monthly payments) and my debt. 

At this point I have no idea what to do. With weekly payments of $4500 and inventory slowly depleting I have no way to come up with 100k to pay off my debt. Even if I sold everything I had left from the store I would still be left with 40–50k in debt. 
I feel worthless and I feel like I keep putting myself in a hole. Some days are very hard to keep a smile knowing the situation I’m in. I’m hardly getting sleep now just thinking about my kids futures. I’ve been eating sandwiches every weekend at these shows for dinner. It’s got the point where I don’t eat lunch anymore because I just can’t afford it. Mentally trying to stay there and be strong for the kids but it’s really hard 
I don’t want to lose my house or any vehicles. 
Any advice or tips would be great. ",12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Debt/comments/1g5ayk5/100k_in_debt_someone_please_help/,1729114987.0,Top-Rip9824,1g5ayk5,advice_seeking
Debt,getting started investing,22 & 90K in Debt,"I’m 22 (turning 23 soon) and a first-generation immigrant to the U.S. I’ve been here for about three years, and recently, I started earning $55K a year at my job. However, my wife and I are currently dealing with around $90K in debt, which includes medical bills, car loans, failed business investments, and credit cards.

Theoretically, I could pay this off over the next 8-9 years, but seeing that timeline is pretty frustrating. I’m looking for a second job or part-time work to help speed up the process, but I’m also seeking advice on how to tackle this debt more effectively.

A bit more context: my wife works and studies, contributing to the bills, and she’s set to finish her degree in a year. Once she graduates, we’re hoping she can land a job with a similar income to mine, which would definitely help us get out of debt faster.

If anyone has been in a similar situation or has tips on how to manage and pay off debt quicker, I’d really appreciate your input. I’m also looking for motivation and support from this community—seeing others’ success stories and knowing there’s a light at the end of the tunnel would be a huge help.

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and I look forward to your suggestions!",10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Debt/comments/1esnxan/22_90k_in_debt/,1723702120.0,SpecialistStart52,1esnxan,advice_seeking
Debt,getting started investing,Hole has been dug deeper,"\*\*\* Update following original post \*\*\* To preface I am not trying to be a victim.  I just really zoned out until I looked up and saw the mess I created in my life and just see no way out.  I guess just encouragement and sharing your stories as well as anyone who has been in this situation and has tips for getting out.  Your words will not fall on deaf ears.

Hey, everyone, just going to vulnerably lay it all out here. I am 29 years old, a full time fireman and have a health and wellness coaching business that is gaining traction. (Here it goes) I started at a mortgage brokerage 3 years ago and began creating content etc and got recruited to a start up brokerage and was promised the world. I was newly single and was spending a bunch of money banking on future income (genius). In 2023 I made 145k but moved to a nice apartment and was going on trip after trip after trip and was racking up CC debt and paying it off, until i racked it back up and my best friend was killed on his motorcycle. I gave myself some grace for a few months and then a mentor, a super close older brother type figure suffers a massive heart attack and passes away 2 months later. I left mortgages shortly after.

I fell into really bad habits just taking the instant pleasure and path of least resistance. I lost most of my discipline and drive and really was a numb zombie for these past 12 months. I don't say any of this to be a victim by any means, I just want some help because here is the kicker. I literally felt nothing for so long and I started trading options again February 2024. I was up 18k and feeling jolts of emotions again and fast-forward to now I am down 22k on the year. I cannot help but not want to be alive anymore and I really just am searching for a way to get out of this hole I have dug myself. I made and lost my money back multiple multiple times this year before falling off a cliff, the emotions finally took a toll on me. Heart was beating out of my chest as I was trading full account size, blood pressure through the roof. Ridiculously unhealthy.

I understand I will probably get my balls busted pretty hard but damn man at 29 I feel like I'm going to be a fuck up forever. I do own a duplex and live in the top half but I just have always had such high ambition and I never expected to not be so much further along in life. I kept adding to credit card because I was making consistent money trading but always had big days where I lost my whole account. Just hoping there are some older people out there that could pass down some wisdom. For some reason 29 seems too old to start over or get past this and I know it sounds stupid but when you're in the storm you can't help but feel like this is it. I have never been a victim, I have always worked hard but I just started spending and got into terrible habits. Debating on doing a debt settlement with accredited debt relief but I don't want to tank my credit. I appreciate any positive insight from you guys as I am at a real low point just desperate to turn my life around. Thank you

\*\*\*\*Life update.  Cannot believe 4 months have flown by the way that they have.  I had so many amazing people reach out and give life wisdom and I really did take it all in.  What I did do was transfer most of my high interest debt to a HELOC (43k) 30k of it to debt and with the remaining 13k of the money i paid for a marketing coach for 3k and I used 10k to....trade.  I made back 7k in 2 weeks from trading and my internal voice was screaming to withdraw that money and pay debt...I got greedy.

I started full sizing swing trades with long expiration which would have worked all year last year but then tariff news started coming out and the market sentiment completely changed and the market sold off.  Having been emotional in the past I decided to just give it time but everything kept selling off which resulted in my losing 18k more this year.

I know how stupid this is, but the desperation for financial freedom and constantly looking at this hole, trying to get out, it's like quick sand.  I haven't been able to just ""let it go"".

  
I currently make about 100k before taxes.  The goal was financial freedom and stepping away from firefighting to go full time into my health and wellness coaching business but obviously that cannot be done by any means now.  I have hijacked my freedom by rushing the process and being overly emotional.  Our current fire station sucks the life out of you and is a shit hole.

I never thought I would be in this position and truly feel like an absolute jackass.   Now totaling 36k lost in just a single year while racking up 30k of credit card debt it all seems insurmountable.  I have weeks and months of making money back disciplined and then it's always massive red loss days that set me back.

Debt,how much to save,I've ruined my family's financial future,"To start off, I am 34 years old, have 2 kids and a wife, and was financially successful to the tune of $250k/year as of 2 years ago.

I left my job, sold my house, and moved across country 4-5 years ago to start a business with a formerly close friend. We ended up working together for 2.5 years, and scaled that business from $0 to $3.5 million annually within that timeframe. Unfortunately, after getting to consistent success, we were hit with a lawsuit which not only cost around $300k to settle, but put significant strain on the partnership / friendship and led to us splitting up.

After breaking up the partnership, we cut our losses, took a couple final payouts from what was left of the business, paid the remainders of our debts, and went our separate ways. I ended up starting a second business in the same field, which initially was seeing a good amount of success, but not enough to cover the cost of my life, which had ballooned through loans for nice vehicles, expensive rent, and now a wife and 2 kids. Here's where my real mistakes started.

I didn't realize quickly, but I was living far above my means, and because of this, was still able to pay myself through the business, though just enough to cover my rent and monthly payments, which amount to around $8,500/mo. I kept telling myself things would improve with the business, and found that I couldn't make my quarterly tax payments for the business, so was going to continue to work at it and make up the shortfall at the end of the year. It's now the end of the year, and I'm sitting on the following:

\- 1 vehicle I owe $52k to the bank for, and am currently $7k underwater in  
\- $25k+ in back taxes for the last year, and more to come once I file 2025 estimated taxes next month  
\- still responsible for $2,300 in rent per month, plus regular expenses for groceries and things for my kids to live  
\- $280 per month in motorcycle payment  
\- $750/mo in wife's car payment, which is currently at the break even point of owing as much as the vehicle is worth  
\- $10k in cc debt  
\- $35k in medical debt from the births of my children

All in all I'm sitting in a $140k hole right now, and a failing business that I'm working on getting removed from so I can cut my losses and move on. I did receive a job offer I'm going to take for an $85k per year sales position, which isn't enough to cover the shortfall and liabilities I'm sitting on, but at least it's a start. Wife is able to work, and we're considering positions she can take, but with 2 kids that would need childcare, (large expense) in addition to all the other factors at hand, it's a bit more difficult to figure out.

I guess I'm just at a loss at the moment as to how I got here from being on top of the world 2 years ago, and looking for some advice or stories of others that have experienced similar things. I just need to know there's still hope for my life, as I've got around $15k in an IRA saved for retirement, about $8k to my name, and life just feels like it's falling apart all around me.

3/11 Edit: Thank you to everyone that's chimed in with sound advice and encouraging words. It's not that I truly think our financial life is over based on this, but that it's going to be supremely uncomfortable to try and climb out of the hole I've dug for myself / my family. 

We're working on selling the more expensive of the two vehicles this week, and once that's gone will be selling the motorcycle and wife's vehicle in favor of something cheaper we can pay for in cash or on a SMALL and manageable loan. Bankruptcy isn't the route just yet, but keeping that as a backup plan if all else fails in the short term.

I should have a written job offer in the next day or so, which will start to get us back to maintenance rather than the current hemorrhaging, and wife is looking for childcare positions, and considering taking on in-home nanny services for 1-2 other kids if there's nothing immediately available for her. 

Though this is a tough time, all the outreach and wisdom from you all has been immensely helpful. Can't thank you all enough.",1465,https://www.reddit.com/r/Debt/comments/1j7hvo7/ive_ruined_my_familys_financial_future/,1741554889.0,Useful_Glass2963,1j7hvo7,advice_seeking

Debt,how much to save,Fiancé’s $40K debt consolidation hit with lawsuit- Considering bankruptcy before marriage.,"Here's the situation:

My fiancé has around $40,000 in credit card debt. About a year ago, he enrolled in a debt consolidation program through JG Wentworth. He’s been consistent with his payments, but today he was served with court papers. JP Morgan is suing him for approximately $6,000. It appears this is one of the creditors that JG Wentworth hasn’t yet settled with. We now have 23 days to respond to the court filing before the lawsuit proceeds.

I’m not very familiar with how debt consolidation or bankruptcy works, but based on the research I’ve started doing today, I’m beginning to think JG Wentworth might be a predatory company. At this point, I believe it may be time for him to consult with a bankruptcy attorney.

He’s been hesitant about the idea of bankruptcy, especially since we’re hoping to buy a house within the next five years. However, I’m concerned this lawsuit might complicate things further if we don’t act quickly.

Financially, he makes about $60,000 per year, and I make the same. We don’t own any significant assets other than our paid-off vehicles, and we rent from a family member. His only debt is the credit card debt. I have about $13,000 in student loans. We’re getting married in July, and I’m worried that could complicate or impact his potential bankruptcy case.

Any advice would be appreciated, especially around whether bankruptcy might be the right move and how marriage could affect the process.

  
Thank you!

* Edit *
*I did post this in the thread, but I'll leave it here too.**

Wow, I didn't expect my original post to spark. So many strong reactions! 

I wanted to follow up and give a bit more context about our situation.

My partner went through a really tough divorce a few years back. His ex-wife could afford a solid attorney, he couldn’t, and unfortunately, he ended up saddled with a large portion of their marital debt.

After the divorce, he moved across the country to start fresh. Then came a string of setbacks: an injury and job loss that caused the debt to spiral even further out of control. Sometimes life just punches you in the face when you’re already down.

That’s why we currently made the decision to move in with family. We still pay rent and contribute to utilities because we know everyone’s feeling the pressure these days, and we don’t want to be a burden. But this move gives us breathing room, no sky-high rent, and a chance to get back on track.

We’ve come up with a 5-year plan:

He’ll focus on paying down his debts

I’ll focus on saving for a down payment on a home

I’m really wary of predatory debt consolidation companies that might make things worse for him in the long run. That’s why I asked about bankruptcy, specifically Chapter 13, as it seems like it could help structure his debt into something more manageable while I continue saving.

I truly appreciate all the thoughtful and helpful advice shared in this thread. Thank you to everyone who’s taken the time to comment, it means a lot!

* Edit #2 * 😂 

Oi. The “WHAT DO YOU SPEND MONEY ON?” question is starting to get frustrating. People are making a lot of assumptions.

To clarify some more: we just moved in with family in April. Before that, we were living apart due to separate lease obligations. So this change in housing is very recent, but it's already put both of us in a much better financial situation.

Personally, I’ve worked hard over the last few years to get to where I am now. I have a solid amount in savings. The only debt I have left is my student loans. My car is a 2022, fully paid off. I have some issues. I keep up with my medical expenses so they don’t turn into debt. My credit card balance is under $300, and my credit score is 780.

As for my partner: yes, he has debt. $40k, and he earns $60k annually. But it’s important to understand the context. He went through a rough divorce, and due to uneven legal representation, he was left with a significant amount of marital debt. They were home owners twice over, the second being a remodel, that's why there was a larger amount of debt when their marriage fell apart.

People go through tough life events: divorce, medical issues, job losses. It doesn’t automatically mean they’re irresponsible or “bad with money.”

I’m not paying off his debt, and he doesn’t want me to. That’s his responsibility, and he’s working on it. I just want him to make the best decisions possible now that we’re both in a more stable place.

I don’t post to Reddit often, so I didn’t realize how much context people would need. Lesson learned!",74,https://www.reddit.com/r/Debt/comments/1l4ja3i/fiancés_40k_debt_consolidation_hit_with_lawsuit/,1749182931.0,Tricia-Tree,1l4ja3i,advice_seeking
Debt,how much to save,$186K Debt - A Cautionary Tale,"Not really typing this out for advice, as I know what needs to be done and we're fortunate to have a path out of this mess. Maybe more of a cautionary tale. We are $186K in debt across 21 lines of credit, making about $120K per year.

My wife feels very strongly about helping out family members, and we've spent atleast the past decade helping various family members and vastly overextending ourselves to do so. She handled all the finances and I just kind of looked the other way because we made okay money, and I knew how important it was for her. It was always more than I thought we should provide, but I believed we were still able to afford it. This has basically culminated in allowing some of her family members to live in a house we own, and essentially not paying rent once they fell on hard times. This has tightened things up significantly.

I thought we were getting by, but have recently found out my wife has basically been maintaining our lifestyle through extensive spending on credit cards. We've had issues with credit card debt in the past and even took out a HELOC to consolidate it. Back then we did the whole rigmarole of tightening up, making a budget with YNAB, etc. But once you feel like you're in a good spot it's just SO easy to just loosen up and stop paying attention. And that's what I did.

Obviously the signs were there that we were spiraling in this direction again...and I am completely responsible and complicit in not being involved enough or heeding the warning signs. I made my wife deal with it all on her own and she did what she thought she needed to keep us afloat. But things came to a head this month when our bank account was basically completely empty with more bills coming out. Our debt payments alone is $3.2K per month...on top of paying 2 mortgages and living expenses.

Literally our only saving grace and why I'm not having a *complete* melt down of existential dread is 2 things:

1. I am in the military and eligible for SCRA benefits. 8 of our credit cards have literally a 0% interest rate, and most of the rest are under 6%. If we did not have this, we would simply not even be able to cover our monthly debt. For anyone in the military that's in debt, seriously look into this. It is a lifesaver.

2. We own 2 homes, and have a good amount of equity in both of them thanks to when we bough them (Pre-COVID). We can likely make $75K from one, and $200K from the other. It still REALLY sucks to know that basically all the profit from them will go to pay off stupid debt. But selling these houses is basically our way out of this pit of despair that would likely take decades if we did not own them. We are more fortunate than most to have this lifeline.

What's depressing about it most of all is that we really have nothing to show for all the debt. We really weren't living some grandiose life. It was just death by 1000 cuts and not sticking to a tight budget despite putting ourselves in a bad financial spot by supporting family members. And once the debt got to a certain point, it just spiraled out of control from interest. The crazy thing is we would have been able to swing our bad decisions if we just budgeted correctly. 

I'm more fortunate than most that I will still have a pension/retirement despite doing practically nothing to save for it, simply because of my occupation.

Debt,how much to save,Do NOT use Ascend Loans,"Made some stupid financial decisions in a pinch. Stupidest decision I have made was getting a payday loan from this company. 

It’s actually sad how predatory these companies are and taking advantage of people in a time of need. I applied for a $800 loan, because I was desperate I didn’t read the contract and realized they were charging me a 700% interest. 

When I finally got the statement I owed $1,077 and with a minimum of $229.00 a month. No matter how much I was paying it seemed like it was never gonna end. Luckily my best friend loaned me the money  to pay it completely off , I’m paying her back with no interest. Please save your time and stress and do mot use this company and please don’t be dumb like me and not read a contract.

I'm nearing 30 and had goals of having a career, a home, and enough income to help take care of my mother, yet here I am still living with her and having nothing to show for it. I have no savings, made stupid choices when I was younger, and am now jobless and feel like I am going to be stuck with this debt forever. I hate it, I hate that I lacked so much self-control before getting medicated that it put me in this position. But, I'm facing it now, and it's better late than never.

Debt,savings rate,Sigh…Kid is in deep with the tribal loans.,"My darling, independent adult child is a full-time student 12 hours from home.  He works part-time & has been doing a couple of gig jobs in his free time.  

He finally came to me during his last trip home, absolutely freaking out.  He wasn’t working early in the school year, ran down his savings, needed money & didn’t want to ask for it because he’s an adult.  He took out 4 different loans-which he’s been paying on, but now he’s drowning.  He intended to take out one to pay the other & it snowballed out of control on him.  

I took a look at the documents & I could use a hand because I am out of my depth here.  

He has 2 different loans with Rise Credit-one with CC Bank for 2500 with APR of 195.08% (paid 390.16 so far, finance charge of 7643.13 for a total due of 10143.13), the other with FinWise Bank for 1000 with APR of 197.76% (paid $845.91 so far).  He took out a 1200 loan through Rise Up Lending with APR of 738.23%! (paid 2249.52 so far, finance charge of 5228.23 for a total due of 6428.23).  The last loan is through Lucent Cash for 1200 with APR of 538.06% (paid 1144.48 so far, finance charge of 4809.07 for a total due of 6009.07). 

Are these interest rates even legal?!  He’s currently paying 867.63 every 2 weeks for a total of 1735.26 monthly, which is insane to me.  Any advice on what he should do?  We’re in Ohio, if that helps at all.  I’m not in a position to just pay the current payoff amounts (6208.97 total) to make it go away.  I also don’t want the poor kid to tank his credit right out of the gate.

Debt,savings rate,"I made a stupid mistake, and now I’m drowning in debt","I don’t know who else to talk to, so I’m just putting this out here. I made a really dumb financial decision by consolidating my PayLater and credit card debts into a personal loan, thinking it would make things more manageable. But now, I’m stuck paying $1,000 per month towards my personal loan, and my take-home pay is only $2,400.

The total damage? $23,000. And at this rate, I’m looking at 22 months before I can fully pay it off. I’m diligently making my payments, but it’s a really painful lesson. I feel like a complete failure. I can’t talk to anyone about this because I’m too ashamed. I do have some savings, but they’re under my mom’s name, and I can’t touch them. It’s frustrating knowing that money exists but not being able to use it to lighten my burden.

The only good thing is that I’ve really learned my lesson. I’ve deactivated all shopping apps and closed all my credit cards. But that doesn’t change the fact that I feel like I’ve ruined my financial future.

Debt,savings rate,I was in 4k debt at 29. I'm at 33k debt at 30.,"I'm a second year teacher in Victoria, Australia. Some years ago, I was at about 10 debt on my credit card. This time last year, I had paid it down to 4k debt maximum - very close. At the same time this year, I'm just over 33k in debt on the same card, and have had to increase the limit at least three times over the past year.

To put my life into perspective... my girlfriend and I moved into our own new rented house together with her son last October. I work full-time as a teacher and she's on parenting welfare while studying education support. The issue is, she has EDS (Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome), and is in constant need for healthcare, where neither of us have private health insurance. The amount of appointments there are (doctors, dentist, psychologist, etc.) is wild, and since I'm the primary worker, the cost often also falls to me and my credit card. I find myself being financially responsible for almost everything in the family (though we 50/50 the budget of living expenses between my income and her welfare). I'm not second guessing us living together - she's the love of my life, and I plan on proposing this year with the minimal savings I have while paying back my credit.

To put our finances in order... I earn AU$3,100 a fortnight gross, which comes to $1,800 net after tax and my car's salary sacificing. Interest rates on the credit are 13.74% p.a. on purchases and 21.99% p.a. on cash advances or balance transfers. My partner receives about $1,600 on parenting welfare, coming to a total income of $3,400 a fortnight - after our rent, budgeting and living expensives, we are left with $600 a fortnight to put back towards the credit card - this is typically then nullified by any health expensives we have to pay for (only today, $500 went towards dentistry).

The primary option here is that I get a better paying job (Victoria for teaching is actually the worst state to be in for teacher salary). If I get the position I'm hoping for next year, my annual income could go from $80k to $122k next year, but that's a very heavy ""if"". At this point, though, I have no idea where to go, and the weight of this debt is crushing me.

Any advice would be welcome.",239,https://www.reddit.com/r/Debt/comments/1jyorde/i_was_in_4k_debt_at_29_im_at_33k_debt_at_30/,1744598808.0,AlexTheWhovian,1jyorde,advice_seeking
Debt,savings rate,"Life sucks, horrible mistakes at 18 and 11 years later.","Hi everyone,

I’m just gonna let out my life story. It sucks so much. When I was young, I was never taught about finances, savings, or anything related to money. When I was 18 I opened a bunch of credits cards (I thought it was smart with rewards) but quickly it went downhill. I’ve been able to rack up about $75,000 In credit cards and it’s taken me 11 years to get it down. I’m 29 now and brought it to $34,000. It’s still a struggle and have been trying to find different ways to make this easier for me. I make $106k a year and with a mortgage, living expenses, and everything else I feel like I am just racking it back up since I have nothing to spare and throw at it. I can’t afford to save anything and I feel like I’m drowning.

Financial restructure programs are a strict pass for me. I’ve been doing personal loans and debt consolidation loans to bring the monthly payments down with a better interest rate. I can’t do anything with my 401k as I drained it when I swapped jobs to lessen the blow a bit.

Any suggestions or help? Anything is appreciated and I know once I get out of this whole, I’m never going back in and I’ll be helping others in need when I’m there.

I have $22.5k saved up right now for emergency fund. 
I have a $16k car loan @ 2.9% ($490 payment)
I have multiple student loans with different interest rates totaling $22k ($290 payment) 

My current thought right now is to pay off my car loan entirely and leave myself with a $6.5k emergency fund. This would free up $490/month. Then I would build my emergency fund back up to $10-15k. After that I would throw all extra money every month at my student loans. I’m not too worried about my student loans currently as it’s a low monthly payment.

Debt,build emergency fund,Looking for mathematical best use of my money: HYSA or Loan,"My HYSA has 17k at 3.8% and my only debt (besides my mortgage) is 12k at 3%. The 17k is a couple months emergency fund and already maxed out my 2025 Roth IRA.

What’s the mathematical best thing to do?

I’m okay going back to a smaller emergency fund and building back up. I’m pretty confident my income will remain stable for the next 12-18 months.

Update: I’m new to AI and I finally asked chatGPT. Here is the response. 

“Thanks — the 24% income tax on HYSA interest changes the math meaningfully. Let’s walk through it.

⸻

After-Tax Return on HYSA

Your HYSA earns 3.8%, but that’s taxed as ordinary income at 24%, so:
	•	After-tax HYSA return = 3.8% × (1 - 0.24) = 2.89%

Your debt costs you 3%, so now:
	•	You’re losing 0.11% annually by keeping money in HYSA instead of paying off the 3% loan.

⸻

Mathematical Best Move

To strictly maximize your net worth, you should:
	1.	Use $12k from your HYSA to pay off the 3% debt (guaranteed 3% return).
	2.	Keep the remaining $5k in your HYSA as a partial emergency fund.
	3.	Rebuild your emergency fund gradually, using future savings.

⸻

Additional Thoughts
	•	If you absolutely want to maintain a full emergency fund, it’s also reasonable to split the difference — pay off part of the debt and keep some cash.
	•	But purely mathematically, with a 24% tax on interest, paying off the debt is better.”",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Debt/comments/1kb8jzn/looking_for_mathematical_best_use_of_my_money/,1745989477.0,PsychologicalTaro398,1kb8jzn,advice_seeking
Debt,build emergency fund,Confused about minimum payments on CC,"I was able to build up my emergency fund last year, this year is all about aggressively paying off my debt. I guess I started in December because I reached my savings goal. In December, my minimum payment was $122.28 (20.99% interest rate) In December, I managed to pay $523.36.  
PLUS: I still use this cc to pay my bills. I get paid twice a month, and I pay the cc immediately when I receive my paychecks to pay those fixed bills in full.

This month, my minimum payment went up to $132.00.

I would have thought that my minimum payment would be slightly lower than $122.28. With January first paycheck, I’ve already paid $$391.05. I project with my next paycheck, I’ll be paying another $220.00 (maybe more with additional $50).

Debt,build emergency fund,"One down, many to go…","This week we’ll make our final car payment on a 2019 Subaru Forester(~53k miles, plan to keep for as many years as we can). Over the past year we’ve been making between $600-$1k monthly payments to try to get this one knocked out. We’ve been stretched pretty thin for quite sometime so this is a big one for us in terms of both money recouped and seeing progress for our continued motivation. We’ll snowball this into other debts and funnel a little into our emergency fund to build that up to a larger amount. 

I also anticipate we’ll be able to pay off another personal loan in the next two months which will return another $638/mo back into the budget, again to be snowballed into other debts and some savings. I’ve been targeting large monthly payments to this point but will soon transition to high interest debts with this freed up money and avalanche from here on out. 

In the next 6 months I hope to return about $1500-$1800/mo back into our budget really energizing our snowball efforts. 

We dug a deep hole, but are digging out and we’ll finally start to see some significant progress soon. I hope this brings with it a little bit of weight lifted and less feeling of being trapped. 

I hope to have the majority of our debt paid off in the next 18-24 months and recoup almost $5k in monthly payments in total. It really hurts and is embarrassing to type that out when I think of all the opportunity lost, but all we can do is move forward and be better. 

I’m just excited to be on the cusp of some significant movement. I’ve read so many others experiences and watched as people have been able to do it and it has encouraged me and I hope that you too keep pushing and don’t give up. We still have a long way to go, but I know we will get there. It’s not easy, but we have to do it.

Over the past two years at my company, I’ve been promoted from Demand Planning Manager to Senior Manager of Supply Chain, and now Director of Supply Chain. I work hard and feel stable in my role, earning $80,000 base salary plus bonuses of around $20,000 annually. My monthly take-home pay is roughly $5,100, and my bonuses are paid quarterly (Q1/Q2/Q3 – 15%, Q4 – 55%).

I also have a side income of $5,000-$8,000 expected this year from breeding Bengal cats with my girlfriend. Despite this, I’ve made some poor financial decisions in the past year and need advice on how to clean things up.

My Financial Picture:
	•	Credit Card Debt: $15,700 (31% usage of a $55,000 limit)
	•	Unsecured Loan: $15,000 balance, $560/month payment
	•	Car Loan: $740/month for 66 more months, interest rate nearly 11%
	•	Emergency Fund: $1,500
	•	Monthly Debt Payoff Budget: $1,300-$1,400

Recent Financial Habits:

I splurged on a new truck and took out a loan to consolidate credit card debt but ended up back in debt. I’m determined to turn things around in 2024.

My Plan:
	1.	Year-End Bonus: I’m expecting $6,500 after taxes and will use it to pay down a significant chunk of my credit card debt.
	2.	Credit Card Debt: Focus on paying this off aggressively in the first half of 2025.
	3.	Unsecured Loan: Use income from breeding cats to pay this off once the credit cards are managed.
	4.	Savings: Considering setting aside $250/month to build up a small savings cushion.
	5.	Refinance Car Loan: My current interest rate is nearly 11%. Should I refinance for a lower rate to free up more cash for debt repayment?

Goals:
	1.	Become nearly debt-free (except for my car loan) by 2026.
	2.	Save for a lab-grown engagement ring and a house.
	3.	Avoid ever falling back into this cycle of debt.

Questions:
	1.	Should I focus solely on debt repayment, or is it wise to start saving even a small amount monthly?
	2.	Are my goals to pay off most of this debt in 2025 too ambitious?
	3.	Is refinancing my car loan a good idea to help my budget? I can get a 6-7% interest rate but I may have to extend my terms by a few months which I am okay with. The truck I have should last me 10+ years.
	4.	Any general advice on how to stay disciplined and avoid future financial pitfalls?

Also, I’m incredibly grateful that my parents help me with groceries and insurance (I’m on their plan until I’m 26), which is a huge blessing.

But I need a new car, I need to get my tooth fixed, I need new clothes, I need new shoes. Yet I don't feel like I could be comfortable getting those things as we cut it close every month.

Of that 71K, 33K is in my name and 37K in hers.  We do own a home that has a mortgage in her name for 144k.  The house needs some work but I imagine we could sell for around 200-210K as is.  I do not have any savings or retirement. Plan was to contribute to hers. She has approximately 70K in 401K. She did have some of the 401K before we got married, I would only be entitled to what was contributed in the last 5 years. I do not know that amount yet.

I make 80K a year.  I have looked into refinancing and rolling all the debt into it. That would put my monthly mortgage at about 1800.

We have came up with a few options.

Option 1: I keep the house and mostly everything in it (tools, appliances, etc).  And assume all my CC debt. Mortgage would be 1800 a month but no CC debt.

Option 2: She keeps the house and assumes all debt.  This would mean I would walk away with nothing. No house but no debt. Rent around where we live is approx 1300 per month for a 1 bedroom.

Option 3: Sell the house and split everything down the middle. Would probably involve lawyers at this point and get messy.

Option 4: ???

I should also add I am almost 50 years old.  I've looked at the numbers with utilities and could make it in the house but wouldn't leave much of anything for savings/retirement. I really don't want to move.  Its a great area and a nice house, close to work. I figured if something catastrophic happens (lose job) I could then sell the house and still walk away with a profit depending on the market.

Debt,saving for retirement,Using 401k to pay off $22k CC debt,"Hi everyone. I am currently 25 years old and I make about $90,000 a year in a high cost of living city. I have a very stable job. I have about $10k saved up in a high-yield savings account, but I want to keep that money there in case of emergency. I work in financial reporting. The reason for my debt is, I had a pretty bad gambling addiction the past year and a half. I chased too many losses. I have gotten help for gambling addiction and I have not gambled in more than four months. I have $20,000 in my 401(k). I was wondering if it would make sense if I withdrew from that to pay off a huge chunk of my credit card debt. I know you’re not supposed to withdraw from the 401(k) until you retire and are 60 years old but this debt is just weighing me down a lot, and I can’t sleep at night. I truly believe that my gambling addiction is gone for good. I have banned myself from every sports betting app there is and I have no urge to gamble or go to any casino or any of that anymore and it’s been like that for months. Part of me just wants to get all this debt paid off even if it’s with using my 401(k) money and I just want to start a debt free life and from there just save as much money as I can and put it in my personal Roth IRA and 401(k) through my employer. Since I am young, I feel like withdrawing from my 401(k) right now won’t set me back too much. Please let me know your thoughts.

Debt,50/30/20 rule,Sued by Bank of America ,"My partner is being sued by BOA for a $9000 credit card debt (in Florida). We’ve lived together for 20 years but are not married. He is the main breadwinner. I have a job, but it barely pays for groceries. I’m in my mid 40s and he’s about to be 50. Neither of our health is great, but we can’t afford doctors. I won’t go through the whole saga of how we got to this point, but suffice it to say we are screwed. All of our money goes to rent, bills, and necessities. We have $0 left at the end of the month. He works for himself as a remodeler, so there’s no paycheck to garnish. The only valuable thing he owns is his 2018 truck which is almost paid off, and some tools, all of which are necessary for his work. Aside from that, we have a tv, washer, dryer, and computer that he bought for me. All of our furniture (aside from a $400 sofa that my parents bought for us a few years ago) is falling apart second hand stuff that I’ve had since before I got together with him, or stuff we’ve found on the side of the road. I had Chat GPT help me write a response to the summons because we can’t afford a lawyer, and legal aid didn’t get back to us before the deadline. We have no legal defenses, and it looks like we’re about to be sued by another creditor. He also owes a ton of $ to the government for a loan he took during the pandemic and hasn’t been able to make payments on. Our only hope in the short term is that the BOA lawyer doesn’t show up to court (a friend of ours got sued by BOA for a $30,000 debt and BOA’s lawyers never showed up to court.) If their lawyers do show up, the judge will definitely rule against us. It’s my understanding that bankruptcy won’t help us… especially since it’s in the loan agreement with the government that bankruptcy will not change anything with that debt. What can they take? Will they come into our house and take our washer, dryer, computer, etc? How do they know what is mine and what is his when it comes to personal property? Can they take tools he has to have to continue working? If they garnish his bank account we will definitely be homeless (heck, if the landlord raises the rent again we will be homeless.) There’s no where cheaper we can rent. Is homelessness and losing everything we have inevitable?

Edit: I really appreciate all the comments, but bankruptcy is not an option… I don’t want to go into the details. I need to know what is going to happen without filing for bankruptcy. There’s no need to comment if you’re just going to recommend bankruptcy or talking to a lawyer. We’ve already done the free consultations. They’ve just told us BOA will come after everything they can including the truck.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Debt/comments/1hbk7f4/sued_by_bank_of_america/,1733887192.0,Internal_Hearing_337,1hbk7f4,advice_seeking
Debt,50/30/20 rule,Paid Off Debt (3 months),"So I wanted to just put my story out on how I was able to pay off almost $7,500 dollars in credit card/ dental debt in exactly three months. I started budgeting and setting aside the 50/30/20 rule , I stuck to this down to the last cent. Anything that was left behind on my wants would go to debt. I also started working a small side gig (insta cart) and every single dollar earned/ tips went to debt. I started selling all my old geeky nerd game junk on eBay and netted almost 2k in sales after the three months. I stopped eating out which is where majority of my spending lies. I’m officially debt free, and now working to put that 20% of my budget into my hysa to get an emergency fund going . 

     I’m still going to do some side gig work to help fund my wants which is finishing up my tattoo sleeve and travel. I will not be using any of my credits card to purchase items I don’t have fully funded. It’s amazing to have my finances under control .

Debt,pay off debt,Selling house and renting to pay off debt?,"My husband and I are at a total loss as to what to do with our house/financial situation. A little background: we bought our house in 2022. It was a new build and we bought the rate down to 5%. We have a 7 year ARM so the rate will change in 5 years. We have some pretty significant debts that we pay every month. We also have two little boys that are in daycare which is about $2000 a month. Our household makes about $120,000 a year before taxes. 
Our issue: our second born is starting daycare so we are just now adding that new payment along with a hospital payment from his birth. Overall we are about $1500 in the whole every month after we pay everything including food, diapers, ect. 
Our property tax has increased significantly each year adding $100+ to our mortgage. Insurance keeps increasing as well adding more to it. We also live in an HOA neighborhood and we pay $210 a quarter.
We have tried a HELOC but were denied bc our house appraised way less than what we bought it for. Like $30,000 less.
We are thinking about selling our house, using any equity to pay off debts, and renting until our boys are out of daycare. Rent in our area is $100-$200 less than our mortgage. We do know that it will increase every year, but we don’t know what else to do. Is this crazy? Anyone have any other ideas? 

Update: looked into a cash out refinance that was a no go due to the ratio that we owe on our house. Talked with someone at our credit union and he encouraged selling. Said we could get a 100% mortgage for our next house and they don’t need pmi looking into that option",15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Debt/comments/1mal7pr/selling_house_and_renting_to_pay_off_debt/,1753619805.0,Remote_Professor4478,1mal7pr,advice_seeking

Debt,pay off debt,Husband wants to use money from sale of our home to pay off credit card debt,"It’s a long story (of course), but the brief version is that he has a cycle of running up credit card debt, then paying it off with gifts, loans, inheritance, etc. The he just runs it up again. It doesn’t matter if our income increases, he always finds a way to spend more. I don’t even know where $50k of it went last year & he can’t tell me for some inexplicable reason. 

We are out of gifts. He blew through his inheritance in less than 2 years and it’s completely gone. Credit cards are all maxed & can’t get more loans. 

He took a job in another state to increase his income. We are renting while our house is up for sale. It closes next week. 

After paying off the mortgage & closing costs, we will be left with about $200k in proceeds on a $650k sale. 

He wants to use $55K to pay off his credit card debt. He has no savings & has gone through all of mine years ago.

Debt,credit card debt,Father died with credit card debt,"My FIL passed away with two Chase credit cards that carried a balance. When I spoke with Chase’s estate department they verified the debt amounts and said the accounts had been “charged off”. 

They then told me to call a different department (I did not catch the name of the department) do discuss the accounts. 

According to Google, “charged off” means a creditor has given up on collecting an unpaid debt. Based on that, is it safe to assume these don’t need to be repaid?? I don’t want to call this number and “volunteer” to pay off the debts if he is cleared of them.

He passed away with no will or savings.

I’ve never had to deal with anything like this, so I neglected to provide details that I now realize are important.

Debt,credit card debt,"Dentist opened and charged my credit card 6,000 dollars with no services rendered, then paid my credit debt in full, and closed the card. My credit score went from 780 to 730. Help!","Here's the story: I'm a young twenty something with a modest credit history of one simple starter credit card line. I put 5% on it every month and pay it hence the 780 score. I'm beginning to try to get my life together health wise and conquer my fear of the dentist and receive treatment for the first time ever. At the care plan meeting I got blindsided and strong-armed into opening a credit card I was previously uninformed about to move forward with anything to do with the treatment. My fault for allowing myself to be blindsided. I asked multiple times for other options they told me if I waited I'd be in more pain and more dental trauma. They typed my name and whatever into the credit card website and I was pre-approved for a credit limit of 6,000 dollars. They refused to split my treatments and insisted I do one invasive and costly procedure because of my ""dental phobia"" and put me through for one single treatment.

I went home and after coming down from the panic and anxiety of the meeting and getting walked over I immediately saw all the red flags and told them I'm going to a different dentist. They pitched a fit and refused to cancel the appointment from five months out and I saw more red flags. I cancelled my debit cards and closed the credit card as well to be safe. Before I cancelled my credit card I asked if I was in debt, and they said no. Again, they called attempting to confirm my appointment and they asked me why I closed my debit card that they tried to charge me. I told them I closed my cards because I don't trust them. They asked if I closed the credit card as well and I said ""Yes, of course"". They told me I shouldn't have done that because they fully maxed out that credit card and therefore I closed a card that had 1,000s of dollars in debt to my name.

I freaked out. Obviously. And the dental place's response was to pay off the credit card in 6,000 full dollars in one payment and then close the card. My credit score went from 780 to 730. The ""really easy sign on"" was actually a hard inquiry of course.

This all smells like fraud to me. Receiving a full payment for a medical procedure from a maxed out credit card 5 months before any services are done? I received literally nothing and despite charging me they've never even given me an itemized bill. Or any bill at all. What can I do to alleviate this shit show? Should I petition my case to the credit bureau?

Debt,drowning in debt,Drowning in debt ($250k+). Need some guidance.,"I am in over my head and need some advice on how to move forward in tackling my debt created from my gambling addiction over the last 4 years. Below is the letter I had written to family about my journey to recovery they were unaware of fully (my Mom knew as she is in recovery from alcohol and I felt comfortable telling her first):

<<I screwed up.

I’ve been battling demons for some time now. It’s most likely the reason I’ve been

pushing everyone away and sabotaging my relationships, including the one I had with

my most recent ex. I felt and feel very low – not worthy, not lovable. How could someone trust and

love me when I am like this and have done the things I’ve done. Relationships are

important and when battling depression and subsequent addiction all I wanted to do,

and find myself still doing, is isolate. Hide from a world in which I don’t want to be seen

or thought of as a failure. Seen as less than. Consequences of my actions were the

furthest thing from my mind as I had gotten to the point where I just didn’t care even

though deep down, I knew it was destructive. Looking back, it felt like my consciousness

was put in a small cage unable to do anything but witness my downfall.

It’s hard to pinpoint the exact time this started but the snowball began around the

end of 2020 with the need to escape my environment and become independent. Fast

forward four years to moving from my apartment to Shafer St. The fact that I was

moving into a larger and quieter environment as well as the financial assistance from

my parents brought temporary happiness. That assistance was appreciated yet what I

am now seeing is that it was a catalyst for my untreated depression and addiction which

has led me into severe trouble financially. The habits I created over the years with the

obscene notion that I can expedite my path to becoming debt free combined with falling

back into the depressed mindset of not caring catapulted me into where I’m at today.

This wasn’t a single occurrence which happened over a day. This most recent and

the largest downfall began at the end of May and lasted until August 13 th .

On August 13th I hit rock bottom. One of the worst internal feelings I’ve ever had.

A flurry of emotions and self-loathing. Though through that experience it freed my once

caged consciousness. The realization of it all. The stupidity of it all. The ‘ohhh nooo’ of it

all. That night was the first step to my healing. Right now, writing this, I don’t feel

mended much given the burden I still carry yet I am relieved that I no longer depend on

the habits I created to try to escape. I broke the multi-year cycle. That brings me comfort

and hope.

Today is January 7th and it is day 146 that I am gambling-free. The definition of what

I gambled over the years are as follows: stock options, cryptocurrency, casinos in

Tahoe/Las Vegas, and online casinos. Online casinos (crypto and credit card) made up

the vast majority of my debts. Today, I am in financial ruin. One step away from being

completely screwed: an injury making me unable to work, unforeseen loss of job,

prolonged depressive state (I’ve called out of work for days at a time), etc... I am living

paycheck to paycheck with my nose just above the water.

Here is a breakdown of my debts.

Loan from parents:	 $58,919 -   $561/month – 	   7.625%

Sofi personal loan:	 $60,573 -   $2,345.65/month – 9.74%

Car loan: 		         $15,815 -   $687.66/month -    3.99%

1st Tech loan: 		 $46,603 -   $1206.22/month – 15.39%

Wells Fargo CC:	 $23,812 -   $600/month –        19.99%

Wells Fargo LoC: 	 $4,800 -     $200/month–          23.5%

Chase SR CC: 	         $33,382 -   $950/month –         22.24%

Chase Slate CC:	 $8,200-      $100/month –         0% balance transfer APR next 18 months

2023 tax owed: 	 $8,600.

2024 anticipated tax: $17,000

Rent: $2500/month (about average for where I live: South Bay Area)

Utilities: \~$350/month

My dad asked me last week how I was doing with my remaining Sofi loan. I gave

a broad, beat around the bush answer, of it’s coming along slower than expected was

an omission of truth. It burnt a hole in my heart that I just couldn’t bear. More-so than the

anticipated anger, frustration, pity, remorse, and disdain. It is his understanding that the

only outstanding debts are my car, Sofi loan of \~25k, and the loan from him and my

mom which would have totaled around $85k plus the car and IRS. But now I find myself

pushing close to $280,000 with all debts included. It’s frigging unbelievable. I don’t know

how to proceed other than to keep swimming with my head as high as I can put it. I am

researching credit counselors, non-profit debt management companies to reduce

interest, and have investigated bankruptcy but unless I am unable to work and sustain

my income doesn’t seem like the best option. Moving back home with my parents isn’t feasible either.

Backtracking my independence would only be detrimental to my mental well-being.

What I need is support. I don’t need lectures, remarks that put me down, or

comments of how I should live my life in a belittling way. Don’t smother me either. My

only hope is that this letter gives you insight and understanding of my internal battle with

these demons. The irony of it all is that outside of my addiction, my habits of spending

money is controlled and quite conservative. I’ll be very resistant to spending large

amounts on something that I can use or need but had no hesitation to blow thousands

of dollars on wagers which resulted in complete loss with nothing to show but time

spent, and dopamine released.

My financial turmoil is temporary, however elongated. I will one day be free of the

financial noose I’ve created. For now I am working on small changes in my life to

improve my state of mind and well-being.>>

Everyone was receptive, understanding, and supportive of me which relieved a big burden.

In 2024 I made \~$208k but have already calculated I will need to pay upward of 17k in federal taxes as I had needed to use exempt status multiple paychecks in order not to fall behind on payments.

I make $92.67/hr working 40 hours a week base pay as a surgical RN. That increases when I am charge RN (5%) and when I take call shifts (1/2 pay on call, 1 1/2 pay when called in). I often put in 5-10 hours OT per pay period which helps but Uncle Sam takes the majority of my OT pay.

My average paycheck is between $4500-$4900 q2 weeks.

I have closed my Wells Fargo credit card recently and am in negotiations to reduce my interest rate.

What is the best course of action? I am at a point where I want to just stop paying, let everything go to collections, get sued, settle, and move on. But to me that doesn't feel right to do.

Any insight would be much appreciated.

Debt,drowning in debt,Drowning in Debt in Oklahoma — Considering Bankruptcy While Expecting a Baby,"Hi everyone,

I’m looking for some support and guidance from others who may have gone through something similar. Right now, I feel completely overwhelmed.

Here’s my situation:

	•	I have about $225,000 in unsecured debt spread across different banks.

	•	I also have a $290,000 housing loan and a $19,000 car loan.

	•	After making debt payments, my disposable income is negative every month.


	•	We are expecting a baby this month, which adds a lot of pressure—emotionally and financially.

	•	Originally, my wife planned to leave her job after giving birth, but now that doesn’t seem possible.

I consulted a bankruptcy attorney in Oklahoma to explore Chapter 7, but he dismissed the idea outright without reviewing my means test or disposable income, saying I make “way over $100k” and wouldn’t qualify. But with our actual expenses, especially after debts, I feel like I’m sinking fast.

I don’t know what to do. My wife is understandably losing patience, and I’m feeling lost. She’s been talking about walking away from the relationship, and it’s scaring me.

Has anyone faced something similar? Does a spouse quitting work after childbirth affect a bankruptcy case? Would that help or hurt a Chapter 7 filing?

Any thoughts, advice, or shared experiences would be really appreciated right now.

I’m trying to understand how the means test works when verifying disposable income, especially in bankruptcy cases. Does anyone know if unsecured loans (like personal loans) are not considered in the means test when calculating disposable income?

Thank you.

Citi- $14,000 APR 27.24%

I have used ChatGPT to create the debt snowball budget and monthly budget I was looking for. It currently has our payoff date in 3 years. I work 2 jobs, but I’m going to have my husband start with DoorDash or something similar on the side and all of that income will go towards debt. We already don’t do anything outside of the house in terms of entertainment and vacations, but any eating out we do will now be nonexistent until this debt is paid off. 




My husband and I have 4 kids and have been married for 16 years. Over the past few years we have racked up over $70k of credit card debt. No real reason, just being stupid. We are now really trying to figure this out, but we’re so over our heads. We enrolled in a DMP last year, which was a huge help, but it’s not enough. We need to seriously cut our expenses by about half to get this stuff knocked out. We have cut down as much of the day to day expenses that we can, but the debt is totaling about $1700/monthly in minimum payments. We looked at refinancing the cars, but were denied. We’re considering asking his parents if we can live with them for a little bit, but again that’s 6 people and 2 dogs, and we feel like that’s a huge ask, maybe too huge of an ask. We have also looked at moving into a new place, but apartments in our area are only about $400/month cheaper. While it’s cheaper, when you account for moving fees and breaking our lease, it doesn’t really make sense. I have tried creating a budget for a week now and honestly it’s just too much. I’ve considered bankruptcy, but I have land that I own with a relative (we’re getting ready to sell) and my husband works in accounting. We know if anything happens with his job, it would be harder for him to get another with that on his credit. At the end of the day, we don’t know what to do. Every solution isn’t ideal or really good enough. We have to do something. Anything. We will likely ask his parents tomorrow if we can stay with them, but we need a plan B in case they say no.

Eventually they stopped sending notices, my credit improved, and I hadn't heard anything about the debt in at least 6 years.

Debt,debt snowball,Tools I used to wipe out my debts,"Personal story. 5 years ago, I probably had about $20k debts that I carried over for about 10 years slowly increased. Just wanted to share some tools that I used.

I'm 35, I had my first credit card at age of 18. Had 2 DUI in my early 20s and paid fines and lawyer fees with the cards and was just paying minimum. 8 years ago, I was getting married so I opened up few credit cards to pay for my wedding. My credit was at low 600s. I basically was not aware of the credit card concept. As I got to my 30s, I realized that I was going nowhere with it and I was doing major research to wipe all these out. At first I was thinking about debt consolidation but realized that it will remain in my record so I avoided it. Luckily that's when Covid happened. I kinda used that situation.

1. I called/chatted all my creditors. I have BOA, CITI, AMEX, DISCOVER. Total of 7 cards back then. First thing I did was asked for increase of credit limit. < This you can ask every half year. The longer you hold your card and use your card, they'll give you a increase. This helps with your credit score as well.

2. While I was asking them for credit limit increase, I asked if they can do a temporary freeze on the card which would make it no interest but was unable to use it. Discover accepted, Citi accepted but was able to use card but still APR on new purchases. I did not use my credit cards and focused on snowball on those first.

3. Balance Transfer as I was reducing my credit card debt on those, that's when I found out about balance transfer. It was nearly 1 year after I asked for a credit increase, so I asked again which would make my CITI (The 2nd longest which was 10 years) increased my limit to $25k. Whatever the balance on the other card, I transferred to this card which was like $8k.

4. New card for intro benefit (balance transfer again): I had opened a new card on Amex for balance transfer benefit as my 12 months period with CITI was coming to an end. As I was making more than minimum and thoroughly built my structure of paying off during the term, my credit score was at near 800. Even though I did not need the new credit card, I hated paying for interest more. I browsed a lot of credit card options and found new card with no AF and offers balance transfer. I took advantage of it and transferred about $3k and paid that off in few months.

Overall, I have 9 credit cards that I do NOT carry balance but use monthly for bills, my credit limit combined is $125k. For 5 years, almost every 9 months I asked for the credit limit increase which helped me boost up my score, and took advantage of balance transfer.

I know that most of the credit companies will not put a temporary hold on your account these days so my method might not work but do your research and work yourself through. My best bet is using the balance transfer, create your own payment plan. Not to offend others, just hoping it may help someone at least by little.

Debt,student loan help,advice for student loans through sallie mae,"Hey everyone i’m at my wits end here and it’s getting exhausting. For context i have loans through sallie mae totaling $107,000. They are 4 different loans with interest rates of 16.75% variable, 16.75% variable, 13.75% fixed, and 13.75% fixed. my monthly payment is $1,500 a month and interest occurring a little over $1,300 a month.

I’m 23 years old and have a co-signer on this (my mother) who is of no help unfortunately for payments or information/help regarding the loan. I was 18 when this was brought up to me and had no idea what was signing for (how much monthly payments would be, or what interest was even on this) is that on me yes but at 18 i didn’t even really understand the gravity of a loan or what it even entailed. These payments are killing me the stress and weight on this loan is affecting my everyday and it feels as if there is no light at the end of the tunnel and i’m just getting tired.

I’ve tried to refinance multiple times but got denied because my mom’s credit isn’t great and neither is mine because i’m still building credit. I don’t think I want to default but my options are running thin and so is my energy living the way i am currently paying this. The feeling of needing to choose between food / gas to get to work or paying my student loan is getting unbearable. The truly sad thing is i want to pay this back, I’m not looking for them to just go away.

I’ve been calling sallie mae for the past 6 months trying to get a payment plan figured out so i can pay them and everytime it falls on deaf ears and they just throw the graduate repayment program in my face which is just paying the interest if the loan which is only a little over $150 difference from my actual payment. It feels as if they almost want me to default. Sorry for the long post but any advice would be appreciated because i’m just wearing thin.

Debt,student loan help,Student loans next steps.,"Just curious as to what you would do in my shoes. Or if you don’t wanna give advice and  you’re at least curious, it’s a train wreck situation that just grows worse and worse. So maybe you’ll at least get a good morbid chuckle.

currently enrolled in one of the business programs, a decent ish one. “Better” or more technical than a Business Admin, but not as good/technical as like accounting. At ASU Online and I’m 23. I currently have a little over around 54k in total student loan debt, 10k in federal 24k in one private loan (Sallie Mae from a different and more expensive school before this program. Which is also at 16%… To say I was stupid and ignorant towards interest rates is beyond a statement. Also didn’t help that I had no credit at the time, and for whatever reason my parents were like “yeah go for that”.) 


and a little under 19k at 4% from last years ASU Online when I maxed out a bunch of credits.


I have about a little over two semesters left possibly 2 semesters to get my degree. 2-3 classes I’m able to take at my local CC but the rest I can’t because they’re higher up/specific classes that I can’t take at a CC as they won’t transfer over and it’d be effectively pointless.

I get essentially no help from federal because of my parents income, though unfortunately they really aren’t of much help because I’m one of three “kids” in college. Though I am living at home without rent and under their health insurance which is obviously arguably help enough.

To make things even better💀💀 I am chronically ill and without health insurance (pretty decent-good health insurance at that) my treatments would be impossible to afford. Another reason why my families insurance is really helpful/important. Though this is important in stating as I’m 23, so I have 3 years max left of being on their plan meaning I’d really prefer to get my degree asap so theoretically I could get better job opportunities/opportunities with decent-good health insurance.

I’ve also applied/continuing to apply to a bunch of scholarships, though how well is that realistically to pan out.

Way I see it I have a few options,

1.	⁠Get even more loans and try to pay off a little with a lower paying job and get my degree asap.

2.	⁠Try to work at Starbucks for the tuition plan, (Starbucks will cover 100% of your tuition) though you need to work there for 90 days. Meaning if I started literally tomorrow I wouldn’t be eligible until Oct 2nd, though session B eligibility is possible providing I started literally within the next week. Or I wouldn’t be eligible until Spring, which I could in theory just max out on credits. Though idk how well that would work out.

Or 3. Just take time off in general try to save up a bit and pay for classes myself or like option 1 just with small(er) loans. Though I absolutely hate the idea of this given again I’m 23 and just want to have this degree over with. Though ik it’s probably best choice in terms of realism.

I’m already in plans to get that really bad loan rate down through refinancing, and try to pay off as much as I can during so. Especially considering the interest rate/that loan alone is really whats slaughtering me/my debt. So while that’s an issue hopefully it won’t be for significantly longer, but I’m again just worried that I won’t be able to get a good paying job until finishing my degree.

Especially considering I’ve been unemployed for months after a lay off… hence the more loans for summer classes though I’m starting a job this week so again I’ll hopefully be able to apply some to that one bad loan and current/future courses. I don’t think the whole “I’m just two ish  semesters away from my degree” will really cut out in an interview for a serious job when they bring up a degree, though I’m not trying to be like 100k or something in debt especially for a Buisness program degree",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Debt/comments/1mfaitq/student_loans_next_steps/,1754088026.0,lostamongtheleaves,1mfaitq,advice_seeking
Debt,student loan help,Options requested: 100k+ in student/personal loan debt,"Hey everyone, my sister has crippling debt from putting herself through school, and she still has a year left. I am looking for help to better understand her options and the effects of these and what would be best for her. 

She is the youngest of 6 and our mother, who was able to do parentPLUS loans for the eldest of us, passed away after a battle with cancer before my sister began her college education. She has taken out multiple loans of about $10-15k to cover the last few semesters of school. My schooling situation has been much different than hers, so I am not aware of the options available to give her some relief. I really want to help, but am not very knowledgeable. 

If anyone can give any more information on debt consolidation and how it works, or possibly even filing for bankruptcy, I would be very grateful. I have tried to look some stuff up but can’t get very far just looking for info without having to put all of her information in, which I’m not sure she’s ready for (and with all the scams out there nowadays-I want to make sure we are only doing this for her best options).

Debt,student loan help,"Owed Tuition, CC, Student Loans.. Need Help","Hi all,

Throwaway account for safety reasons. 

I am 21 and I am in debt looking for advice. I currently live with my SO and their family. I do not pay rent. 

LOCATION: Indiana 

SCHOOL: Kentucky

BACKSTORY: From June 2023-December 2024 I attended a well-known public university in a neighboring state. In Summer 2024 I decided that I would try for a Dependency Override on my FAFSA. Long story short, after sending multiple letters back and forth, I was ultimately denied my Dependency Override due to ""insufficient evidence of abuse"" and ""recent contact with my parent."" (My father passed December 2022 and I do not live with my mother but the Fin Aid office determined i didnt meet the requirements) Ultimately, I wasn't able to file the 2024-25 FAFSA until December 2024. Due to this, I was not disbursed any loans for my Fall 2024 semester nor any of my grants and aid that was supposed to cover that semester. In fact, I still have a scholarship that they instead offered for the 2025-26 academic year, which I will not be attending. This past Fall 2024 semester was extremely hard on me as I also had a professor that accused me of academic dishonesty. On top of dealing with classes, Fin Aid, and my English professor, this semester was really just not it for me and a ton of things went downhill fast. I ended up dropping one class and failing another. Since my aid didn't go through, I couldn't apply for the Spring 2025 semester.

My mental health has plummeted since then. I've been in this block of unemployment and have been scrambling to find a job. I have applied to UPS but am now learning that I may not be able to get the job (Air hub) due to the Security Threat Assessment by TSA standards. This rule essentially disqualifies you if you have over $7,500 in ""bad debt,"" which I unfortunately, just barely have. I'm scheduled for biometrics where I assume I will wait for my background check to be rejected due to this rule. Im hoping to still work at UPS just not a position where the TSA standards apply. 

Also another noteworthy aspect, I've been out of a job since June 2024. I became on-demand/taking an LOA (leave of absence) from my jobs and ultimately never went back to them due to starting school and declining mental state. As for transportation, my car is currently not roadworthy. The registration expired May 2025 and I haven't even driven it all this year because my insurance lapsed. I am working with a close family member who is willing to help me get my car back on the road. 

THE DEBT: In April 2025, I received a ""personal business matter"" letter from my university. It is the final account statement for my owed tuition balance. The principal is $6,105.50 with fees of $1,526.38. The total debt is $7,631.88. The letter states ""Your account has been placed with a collection agency and future communications regarding this balance will come from them."" It's been a few months since I was sent the letter and I haven't received any calls from a collection agency since. I know that waiting is the worst option and I want to try and work out payment options for this debt asap. I've been checking my credit score every month and it hasn't hit yet. There is some information online from the university's website which states that I must ""If your account has been sent to an external collection agency or law firm, your balance is still owned by [school name] and has not been sold to the agency/law firm. However, you must contact the appropriate agency directly to make payments or request payment arrangements."" The site then lists Williams & Fudge Inc as well as Coast Professional Inc National Credit Management. 

MORE DEBT: Discover CC - $2,430.70 of $2,500 limit with 24.24% APR. Have been paying minimum payments. 

Nelenet Student Loans - $5,680 with 5.5% fixed interest. Payments starting August 2025. 

SOO.. NOW WHAT??: So, now I have a lot of information. Do I just call up this place and ask about my collection? How do I go about contacting them in the safest way possible without incriminating myself or ending up getting myself in more trouble than I already am?

RANT: I absolutely hate that I let this happen and that it'll be on my credit record forever. I understand now that I could've prevented this by keeping contact with my school, but it became increasingly difficult and I did not have the mental capacity to keep communicating with them. I am seriously losing sleep and night over this shit it's horrible. I know I'm only 21, very young and lucky to have such little debt at my age. But I know that all of these debts will grow quickly if I don't handle them correctly and fast. I want to do it in the best way I possibly can without fucking up my future even more. 

I know this is a ton to drop at once but I really appreciate if you're taking the time to read this. Any and all advice is appreciated. Yes I know I need to find a job and have been working on it as best I can. I have a couple mental illnesses that hold me back but I want to try my best. I am aware that I can't fix my debt problem without money to throw at it. I just want to know what I can do in the future or right now to help me. 

Talking about this is really hard to do and it's taken a lot from me to even post this. Im sorry for spelling errors I hope it's still understandable. I really need some motivation and support right now. Any advice is helpful. Thank you in advance.

Debt,student loan help,Is now a bad time to start paying off my student loans in the US?,"I haven't paid anything on my student loans in over 10 years. My checks have probably been garnished for years (just learned what this is), I also haven't gotten my State tax return for the last few years, they just put it straight towards the loans. I searched the sub for an answer to this but haven't found anything quite recent enough. 

Due to being medicated for my ADHD for the first time in my life, I've actually been able to stick to a budget recently! Anyway, I've been on [unbury.me](http://unbury.me) to start figuring out my my debt. That being said, I don't make much, my budget is TIGHT. 

I know the SAVE Plan and part of the IDR plan are being prevented from implementation right now, plus the Department of Education has had so many cuts and reforms. I don't know how much or how little these things affect the processes for paying off loans. 

So I'm wondering if it's worth starting the whole process right now, or if it would be better to just leave the garnishing/State tax return as the current payment, and look into it again after these 4 years and things are (hopefully) looking better? Does anyone have any insight?

Debt,student loan help,(27f) Former spending addiction + unexpected bill debt + student loans,"Hi, 

I have $27,000 in student loans that I will have to start paying in 6 months. With that being said, I want to get out of other debt that I have before then. I had to take emergency loans out 3x over the last 4 months. The first time, my dog was extremely sick and had a $1,000 vet bill that I had to pay with little notice. The second time, my car's power steering pump went out and had to be replaced. The third time, my car's alternator went out and had to be replaced. I keep getting set further and further back, having to take out loans, and then getting put even further back because of the loans. I had to quit one of my jobs in order to finish out the semester (one of my classes has a weekly project that takes, and I am not exaggerating here, 20 hours to complete per week). I have a 3.8 GPA and want to keep it that way until I graduate in a few weeks, but I feel so stressed because of money. I have started shopping at Costco to feed myself for multiple weeks, meal prepping and eating at home, skipping out on any and all social occasions, and cutting down significantly on any shopping. This is my attempt at curbing my ""spending"" addiction. I used to get fast food every single day, multiple times a day, and buy skincare products to try and fix my acne (big shocker, nothing worked and I still have acne). 

My total debt outside of student loans is $1,500. I pay $800 in rent every month, $160 on car insurance, $60 on gym membership, $60 on wifi. I am not quite sure what i am spending on food and gas since cutting down significantly on that about a month ago, but I know that I still struggle to be able to get gas some days. Since quitting my second job, it feels like i am living paycheck to paycheck and sometimes can barely do that. **Does anyone have any advice here? What are ways to be more financially disciplined?** I feel like my previous spending habits had a lot to do with my loneliness and depression. I found myself buying things, thinking that they would make me less depressed (like acne products, which I thought would help my skin and cure my self hatred). I feel like I would be a lot better with money if I liked myself. I really want to pay off my debt and start saving money for the future. I am 27 years old and worried that I will never own a home or accrue a livable retirement fund. I have an autoimmune disorder and I am scared that I will struggle to pay medical bills as my health worsens with age. When I do have plenty of money, I get this anxiety in my stomach that says i have to spend it or it will get taken from me. It's so stupid and counterintuitive. I'm sick of myself.

Most people tell me bankruptcy is the best thing that ever happened to them, others say it's not a good decision. The original debt was 5k until I let everything go and continue to rack up. 

Back story, my job reassured me that when I took FMLA to have my twins via C-section that id receive part time disability. It was denied. I lived off my credit for 3 months and I have NEVER recovered. The twins are now 3. Any advice or experience is welcomed. Thank you in advance.

Debt,ready to buy a house,Drowning in Debt with no way out,"In 2023 we had perfect credit and doing amazing.  My husband and I each had several credit cards most with zero balance.  But we had cash loan payment, car payment, motorcycle payment, as we had no house or rental payments and no utilities to pay as we were doing property management, so we were taking advantage of making good money and we were spending and saving little.  But at end of 2023 my husband got ill and could no longer work so we had to move and find a rental home. He has gone through open heart surgery and other surgeries and hospital stays since. Since then everything has gone down hill.  We both ended up out of work.  We survived on savings about 6 months. Then we started using our cards for basic needs, food, utilities, etc.  I’m struggling with my mental health and can’t keep a full time job. And our credit has gone to the worst.   We can’t even afford to pay an attorney fees for bankruptcy.  And right now we are barely surviving on my husband’s retirement income.  Half the time can’t even afford copays for both our medicines.  
Last week he got a phone call, he’s getting served for one of his past due loans.  We’ve moved around the last year, as we’re trying to find the cheapest place we can afford.  And getting ready to make our final move to Arkansas near family.  I’m at a loss and don’t know what to do. Where to turn or anything.  We’ve had to reach out to a local church just for help with groceries.  Vehicles have been repossessed. Thankfully we have one that’s loan free.  I don’t even know what to do. Where to turn to or anything. No one will help us. I mean no one.  
We’ve always been the ones to help people, have always opened our doors to friends and family that needed help, even bought a travel trailer for a homeless friend and her kids to live in. Now I can’t even get a $60 loan from anyone to buy food or a prescription!

Debt,ready to buy a house,Credit card debt. Consolidate into a loan?,"Hi all, 

I know many people have posted similar stories here, but I'm in a heap of credit card debt (20k all together) and I'm considering consolidating everything into one loan. 

Some background on me: I'm a 24f living in NYC making about 60k a year (starting this year). I'm an adjunct professor and administrator. Mainly, I've acquired credit card debt due to moving to the city for grad school straight out of undergrad -- I had a full ride, but had to pay for housing / food so on and so forth. If I'm being completely honest, though, I also have not been as frugal as I should have been (going out for drinks, dinners, buying outfits, etc) and I'm ready to get serious about my finances.

I want to know if you think a personal loan with a lower interest is right for me. I have a discover it card which I would cut up (or close? If this doesn't hurt my score?), a jetblue card that I would cut up / close, and a apple card that I would like to keep for my monthly payments. 

I'm paying a lot of money a month trying to meet the interest + more so that I can beat the debt, and I've never missed a payment, but it's a steep slope with a 27% APR. I'm ready to get more sparse with my spending.

Debt,ready to buy a house,I dug a hole that I'm struggling to climb out of,"
First things first... undiagnosed bipolar disorder can wreak absolute havoc on finances. Please keep this in mind while passing judgment. 😅

I secretly, slowly, dug a financial hole that I'm desperately trying to climb out of. I'm married and have managed our finances for years. We're in our late-30s. He knows about the debt, except about $12k in credit card debt that I'm horribly embarrassed and sick over. I've long been diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and C-PTSD. What we didn't know until recently is that I'm ""a little bipolar"" (doctor's words). I have manic cycles where my spending goes haywire, but I don't realize it until the damage is done. I'm not buying frivolous things or gambling. It's stuff for the kids, things for the house, and an obscene amount of groceries (little waste - most is frozen or non-perishable). It's so damn subtle, but added up over time. We have not found treatment that works well for me, so for now, I'm high-functioning but clumsy.

I'm in moment of clarity and want to leverage it to get a handle on our finances. I'm more interested in accountability than bankruptcy, but I'm overwhelmed by the internet right now. I already have a very good spreadsheet of our budget, and meticulously update balances and payments as they change. I can \*see\* everything - I just need to get it under control.

Credit card debt is my big thing. I can manage car payments, mortgage, student loans, regular expenses (gas, groceries, school lunches). I already talked to my husband, and we're going to make an effort to dine out less and curb discretionary spending. We will try to keep an eye out for my manic cycles, and I will give up my debit card during that time. Credit cards are now locked away.

So... What do we do? How do balance transfers work? Would debt consolidation through our credit union be better? My husband is a veteran - does anyone know of resources through NFCU or USAA? It's about $45k total, including that stupid $12k I racked up in the last year. The rest built up slowly over time, but a lot of it happened while we were a single-income household years ago. About $15k is at 10% interest rate. The rest are 18%-30%. Combined income is about $9700/mo. Credit card payments are about $1500/mo. After all other expenses, and provided we stick to our pact, we have about $1,000/mo to throw at this.

Debt,ready to buy a house,It this the right move on my part?,"(24M) (USA, FL). Hello, with these uncertain times in the market I am a bit scared and am willing to do what it needed!!

I bought a home last year and all is well (knock on wood) but I unexpectedly racked up my CC to its max at 10,000 (right now it is 9777). My girlfriend lives with me (not on deed with me) and she pays me half the mortgage (she requested - she really is amazing) but I told her to stop because she had 5 credit cards with debt on them totaling about 16,000.

As of today (she stopped paying me in December) she only has 2 cards left with about 7,000 total and I have my one.

It was agreed we both get another job. We communicate well so no need for the “relationship advice”. Right now she works in the health industry and at a fast food restaurant. She dumps about everything into the debt. She has her normal bills (insurance, gas) and she buys food for the house.

I believe I work a recession proof job as an engineer (by title) in the utility industry. I am currently a full time student as well getting my engineering degree. And I work a second job. Don’t worry both jobs are going well and classes I’m getting my As, Bs, and Cs.

Is it wise on the track we are now to pay off all debt? It will not be done until August it looks like. After which we will get our 6 month emergency fund (which is very very very very weak right now). My portfolio and other retirements are untouched but of course I am not going to panic sell. It is what it is. I viewed it as get debt cleared, get emergency fund strong af, and then DCA when ready.

Naturally once debt is gone she will leave the second job but will use it to quickly get her own savings up. I will kept my second as it does not interfere with work or school and is solid cash.

Debt,buy vs rent,60k in Credit Card Debt | Rent vs. Buying ,"Hi y'all, I live in a high COLA part of the country (Pacific NW), and was left with all the credit card debt after a brutal divorce (long story, different sub). I'm looking for the best way to approach getting out from under debt and buying a home. Here's the situation; 

Various levels of collections for debt totaling 60K

living with parents, who charge a nominal rent

75K in a CD that matures in March - this equates to my life's savings essentially. 

I can see the simple line is to use the funds from the CD to pay the debt, but what's either an alternative solution, or a solution to get that 60K number as low as possible?

Debt,buy vs rent,Should I file for bankruptcy? ,"I have a high amount of credit card debt, slightly over $40k, mostly from needing to move and live on my own before. I have a total of 3 credit cards. 2 with chase, one with Apple. All cards are paid on time but I am close to drowning and need help deciding what's the best approach to pay things down. The interest is really what's getting me down, it averages $900 a month. Looking at my gross income being about 3k a month, I am wondering if it's best to work with a debt management company or simply declare bankruptcy. My salary is actually 51k but with TRS and taxes and all I definitely do not receive nearly that amount. If I work with a debt company, how do they determine what your monthly payment is going to be? Do you end up on a plan so strict that I wouldn't be able to buy basic necessities? Would bankruptcy be really a bad choice? If not, how do I go about filing? Chap 7 vs 13? For context, I do not pay any rent or have any other bills aside from my car insurance and phone bill. My car is payed off and I live with my bf. I do pay for general expenses such as food and gas.

Debt,buy vs rent,Need Car Loan Advice . Trying to be debt free soon,"Currently in a bind right now. Please bear with me as I understand my situation is unique current. Right now I have a 2022 Nissan Kicks that I bought brand new back in 2022. About a month after I bought it the car was stolen and had about 14k worth of damages done to it that were covered out of insurance. Here's where my problem comes into play. Right now I have about 4 years left on the term. I signed a 84 month finance with 9% APR. I was in the military at that time and genuinely thought it was a 72 month loan vs a 84. My payments monthly are 413$ and I bring in about 4k a month currently(after taxes). My credit isn't great as I don't have a lot of history and only have my car debt . (Currently 652)

If I end up getting hired at a job paying at least 18$ an hour and working 40hrs a week that would increase my income by 75% at least . My question here is what would be the best case scenario here. As long term I want to sell the vehicle. I was car jacked at gunpoint and the vehicle honestly has more trauma of mine in it then positive moments.

Currently left on the loan 21,576$  
Should I dump all my excess income into the vehicle and pay off the loan as soon as possible ? (Ideally by the end of this year)

Sell the car and be upside down , Buy a beater car and just pay off the existing loan ?

All my expenses are currently being paid by the 4k income. Rent, food , bills , car, insurance , savings, etc. Hence the uniqueness. Thanks for any and all advice.

Debt,buy vs rent,"28k in Debt, Inheritance coming...","Hello.

Both my parents passed away (Dad in 2021 and Mom in 2024), they didn't have much but my dad did have the house paid off. I used what little money they had to help pay for expenses, but the rest of the arrangements I put on credit cards. I also had to pay some back taxes on the house, which I prioritized with cash, but it practically wiped out my savings.

I make $120k per year in California. I can afford the $\~900 in minimums on these 4 credit cards, but not much more. Because of the credit utilization (98%), my score has dropped 160 points into the 615 area, and I'm not qualifying for any lower interest loans to help bring down the payment and increase the principal reduction on what I'm paying now. The only thing I seem to be able to do at this very moment is a debt settlement situation, which to me sounds like a long term solution for a short term problem.

The house is currently occupied by family, whom were taking care of my mom (Alzheimer's) so they were staying there rent free. Now that she has passed, they need to start paying rent which was talked about prior and should be starting up in February. Rent in that area is around $3500, and because it's family I'm planning on charging $2500. This is not set in stone though, so it's possible I will have to sell the house if that becomes an issue. The family that is there now wants to buy the house, but I don't think they are in the position right now to afford it at the current rates. The house is worth $650k according to Zillow, but will require about $25k in various repairs to sell it on the market, so it might not be actually ""sold"" for many months out.

What is the best move here? I'm not against kicking this family out, but I do want to have some grace as they took on the very difficult task of taking care of my mom, plus they are family and we have a good relationship. Would it be easier to take out a HELOC once the house is in my name? Use that to pay off the high interest debt?

Should I just take the debt settlement, pay it off early, and work toward rebuilding my credit right away?

Use the $2500 per month to attack the debt via avalanche method and pay it all off in \~1 year?

I just think with the house equity and/or rent income and/or possibly selling the entire home outright, I could handle this without any debt settlement programs--but am I overestimating the benefits of paying the debt off ""directly"" vs. settlement when my score is already in the low 600s?",11,https://www.reddit.com/r/Debt/comments/1hxrvw1/28k_in_debt_inheritance_coming/,1736469228.0,handofreason,1hxrvw1,advice_seeking
Debt,buy vs rent,"With already significant debt, to rent or to buy a house?","With already significant student loan debt, to rent or to buy?

Hey! First time poster here. So basically I(25M) and my partner (25F) are seriously considering buying a home. I have about 100k in federal student loans and 60k in private student loans (I went to graduate school and am an advanced healthcare provider to be general). I also just bought a car, payment info below. am signed up for PSLF for my federal loans so I am planning to pay on an income driven repayment program on that ($500ish a month) starting in July of this year. My private loan payment is about $895/month, and my car payment is about $430/month. The payment for my private loan and car payment is including my overpayment each month to pay the loans off faster. My partner has no debt at all. After taxes we make roughly $87k a year combined. Anyways, we pay currently $2,100 a month for our rental right now. Well, we are very fortunate and just came across a fairly sizable fund that we didn’t know existed which is meant for a house down payment. In other words, we have more than enough money to place 20% down on any house within our budget. With all that in mind, our mindset for purchasing a house is we are essentially throwing away our rent money to our current landlords when we could just buy a house and build our own equity instead. Obviously it’s not that straightforward, we would be responsible for any big expenses like our current landlords are. But honestly we can use the fund for that if we really had to. 

We are looking to buy a house that costs under $325,000 and we found one that costs $305,000 and our payment would be just about $1,950 a month (without homeowners insurance considered). 

Is this the right mindset? I’ve gotten pretty good reassurance from both my parents, my partners parents, and others I talk with about this decision. Thanks in advance! 


Edit: added in more numbers. 

Edit 2: after a down payment, the remaining balance of our “housing fund” is $50k. The current idea is to have this be available to pay for full maintenance of anything that comes up. Alternatively, once my partner and I get married (have a ring already and planning on proposing in the next few months) we would use some or all of this fund to throw a lump sum at my loans (private student loans and car loan).

Debt,afford a house,Live with a bankruptcy or do I sell my home and clear my debt?,"I'm in a unique position as a single parent. I got divorced in 2019 and my debt ballooned as I was responsible for paying the projected realized balance of my 401k as part of my settlement. I was making a crap salary and long story, I'm in debt up to my eyeballs (~65k of high interest and low interest debt). However, in 2020 my parent helped me to buy a house, which is in their name. I have paid the mortgage solely and the house has built equity in the 6 figures. Since the divorce, I've taken my wage from 40k to 90k a year in tech, mostly by going back to school which is part of my immense debt along with the settlement.

My question is, do I declare bankruptcy and live with this on my record while living in this house at 2020 interest rates (pay about 1,500 a month, then utilities etc.), or do we sell the house, I take the equity, pay off all my debt, and move forward as a renter for a while, maybe able to afford a house again in 3-5 years?

Or, is there some third option I'm missing?

And to clarify, I've cut all my excessive spending, I've trimmed off all memberships and subscriptions, and put a full stop to any fun spending.

Debt,afford a house,Too much debt due to divorce,"$62k annual income. 

Over $100k in debt. 
You read that right. 

I’m going through a divorce that has dragged on for 3 years now.  It is contested.  We aren’t rich and never were.  We have spent over $80k in attorneys fees. 

I wanted the house and its mortgage paid in lieu of child support (child support will be $2500 and the mortgage was $1800).  My offer was write up an agreement where he would still have 25% interest in the house if it were to ever be sold and we would add the kids names so they would each also have 25% interest (2 kids). We continued to live in the house waiting for him to leave.  He never did. 

After I initiated separation, life became unbearable.  He stopped supporting the kids.  He caused a scene at my job in an attempt to further deprive me of my newly found income, and accused me of harming him and the kids.  He imprisoned me (literally) at home in the closet at times and at other times, he broke room doors to deprive me of privacy.  At another point, the cops issued an emergency restraining order at his request after I called the cops, he spoke with them and told them I had hurt them.  2 minutes after I was escorted out of the house, he was begging me to return to the house.  I was honestly relieved that I was free but felt bad for my kids.  I got strangled and at this point I somehow convinced him to let me moved to another state with the kids.  

It became clear that we were never going to get back together.  At this point, I was managing my finances just fine and living within my means.  10 months after moving, he showed up where I lived and I had to hire an attorney to get a restraining order against him.  

Since then, he started a divorce in the state where we previously lived although he no longer lived there.  That state can’t exercise jurisdiction over the kids.  I had to hire 2 attorneys to deal with a divorce in one state and custody in another.  I can’t get child support until the divorce case is resolved.  The divorce case has been dragging.  The trail already took place the judge is now contemplating dropping the case because none of us live in the other state and we were not officially separated for a year when the case was filed by him.  I solely have spent at least $50k in attorneys fees. Most paid by credit card, personal loans, and there is $35k outstanding while much more owed to credit card creditors ( I pay my expenses with credit cards so I can afford to pay for their minimum payments due but they are becoming burdensome).  The cases have not ended. He keeps contesting everything.  He doesn’t pay tolls for the vehicle he posses that’s in my name.  He doesn’t pay the personal property taxes.  He is going after me for debt he owes due to fraud he committed. 

We are both in deep shit.  He makes $120k.  I solely support the kids.  He claims he can’t afford to pay child support or spousal support. 

I can no longer afford to make my minimum payments.  I went from an immaculate 780 credit score to 570.  

I know I’ll have to file for bankruptcy, but I don’t want to do that, and if I have to, I don’t want to do it until the divorce is finalized.  I really don’t know if I have another option.  I don’t ever want to end up in a situation where I don’t have enough money to put food on the table for my two kids (5 and 7 now) or not be able to pay for their needs and child care.

If it was I would have done that already. We also lived there for 10 years with everyone in the house. I think it’s understandable my husband and I need our own space at this point for our marriage. The other house is also free and clear, no mortgage. Just property taxes twice per year.

I’m at a loss and don’t know what to do anymore. My husband and I are probably $80k in debt. Mostly credit card debt. But also student loans, a personal loan, and our 2 cars. I know we were stupid and put ourselves here. It’s our own fault. But now we’re at a point we can’t handle it anymore. Chapter 7 is not an option because I technically own 2 properties. Our house we live in, and another property I own with my family and they live there. Chapter 7 will try to take my family’s home and displace them. Plus it’s the home my grandfather built and sentimentally I can’t let it go. If I transfer my name off it, it’s considered fraud. Chapter 13 we may not qualify for because we make too much. This is what a few lawyers told us. And if we did we probably can’t afford the payment. We’re currently enrolled in National Debt Relief because we felt that was our only option. But I’m very nervous about it being a scam and it will screw us too anyway. I was just informed today my student loan will be starting back up in July because I’m no longer in school. I’m a nurse and was pursuing my BSN but couldn’t afford to keep going. Not in school = student loans starting back up. I’ve tried to eliminate everything I can think.

My mortgage went from $2600 to $3500 and will almost certainly go up again soon. The house is worth maybe $200k and I owe $330. I need out of this nightmare mortgage situation.

Debt,first home,Looking for advice on how to tackle debt and where my wife and I can sacrifice.,"Hello, first post here and this sub looks welcoming and non judgmental. That’s reassuring and worth the time to ask how people would tackle our debt load on a SIH. My average take home is about $7500. I’ll be completely honest, we spent a lot of trips and memories to celebrate our journey and spent money we didn’t have. Well now we have a little bit of a stressful financial situation. Here’s the debt load:

Credit Card Debt: 68k majority of it is hers that she used to pay for medical and dental surgeries. 

Truck loan: $936/month
Car Loan: $550/month

Both of the vehicles are underwater as the truck was purchased during the used car shortage in 2023 and the car loan for my wife’s car was a replacement from insurance that they only covered about 60% of the replacement. 

Rent: $1500
Utilities/Cable/Streaming: $300/month

Student loans: $60k give or take. 
Insurance: $400 a month

Tax Bill: $13.5k (on a payment plan for $390/month)

All in all a month we are spending 60-70% on debt and bills. Would it be worth while pulling out money from my IRA to eliminate a good portion of the debt to give us some breathing room? Have about $14k in my retirement account. We have taken steps to get better at budgeting and making more conscious decisions about money. We even took a financial course from a Financial coach that uses a similar approach to what Dave Ramsey teaches. We have talked about her going back to work for the additional income, but I’d rather us tackle this without her going back to a job she hated. I’d rather work more hours working to get us out of debt. 

Would it be worth selling one of the vehicles even though we would be underwater about $5-$7k. Any advice would help if someone has been in a similar situation. I’ve tackled a few cards already that were small balances and now working on the bigger ones. I would like to build good habits using credit and building financial success using the system more responsibly. That’s where we’re at. It’s stressing out my wife more than me as I can just work more to make more money. Not a good way to look at it. I guess I’m asking for some guidance on how to navigate this situation. How did you build a plan with your spouse to tackle a mountain of debt together and not let it create a stressful environment. Bankruptcy is out of the question as I feel that won’t teach us how to work together to be financially successful. 

To be completely transparent this amount of money was life changing compared to where we were 3 years ago. We combined to make $75k pre tax and we have had a wake up call that we need to grow and learn how to handle this money.

Debt,first home,"Debt collection company is threatening to sell my ""personal goods and chattels""","Firstly, I am 58 and unemployed and my partner, retired, is 68. Living in Pennsylvania. We're currently on a very fixed and minimal income. A man came to my home today to alert me to deliquent taxes, particularly school per capita taxes and fees that my partner and I supposedly owe from 2024. He wanted payment today but I said that I can't do anything about this right now. He then gave me my copy of the Distraint forms and said that payment must be made within five days (via their website or mailing a check). The paper said, in a nutshell here without all the legal gingerbread talk, that if I don't cough up $180 then my possessions will be sold *at my house* to satisy the debt.

According to the distraint form's figures, the bulk of this alleged debt of mine ($115) is from 2018 Borough taxes. The guy at the door only mentioned ""school per capita"" taxes owed ... an amount which I noticed later was listed on the page as $11.00 only. It just seems weird and fishy.

Something tells me that I should not have even identified myself to this flunky when I answered the knock at the door. 

Is this technique a legitimate and legal debt collecting practice, intimidating and/or scaring people of a certain age? Do I have options other than totally ignoring this?

But yet payments have continued since then and we haven’t seen anyone contact her about acquiring her collection. Now the papers say no payments have been maid and she has to pay $4k. Now my questions are is it legal for a company to sell the loan, but keep receiving payments? And also how do we navigate this situation?

EDIT: Thank you all for your suggestions and advice. First of all I talked with my wife and she told me she did take a loan of 4k but not one of 2.5k so we have to do some digging and figure that part out. As for the papers, we called the court and they said nothing has been filed yet, so I don’t know if the papers she got were just to scare her into paying or something. Then we called Upstart who issued the loan and all they said was they sold the loan to the other company and we needed to contact them. So my wife called them and they said to forward proof of the payments to verify it is that loan or a different one. I will update once again when we have a response from them.",58,https://www.reddit.com/r/Debt/comments/1j30emk/wife_got_served_papers_need_advice/,1741055388.0,BadJuJu1234,1j30emk,advice_seeking
Debt,first home,Law firm calls saying I owe capital one debt,"When they speak to me they say the debt is from 2008 and that the debt has run course thru collections and now has gone to their law firm. Their saying their going to persue court to garnish wages for the sum of $3,000 ( might be a bit more then that) . I called capital one today and they don’t have any record of a capital one account from 2008, they just show my two current accounts I recently within the last Two yrs picked up. In and around 2004/05ish I think I was kicked out the home I shared with my mother by my uncles . I had remained homeless  a long time it’s along story . With details but instead of blabbering that personal story out here needless to say I had terrible time acquiring sustainable income in my state and borrowed money from a friend and went to Ohio . Spent 4 months in the shelter there til moving in with another friend. Again hard time maintaining employment during alot of that duration with that friend. TIL I got gainful employment with a company I’m with now. Moved out said friends place got my own. I’ve spent the last 5ish yrs turning my credit around but not with out down falls. But I’m currently sustaining wouldn’t call it living but robbing Peter to pay Paul. This law firm recently started calling me about this capital one card from 08 about a month or so ago. They have my social security number and address . I swear my credit was trash in 1997-2009 , I don’t recall having a capital one card at all. They said I was making payments for a year and just stopped. Only credit card i can really recall is one those $300 deposit and you get $300 limit cards from an online bank called first national bank of Marin out of lasvegas area. Which that account closed in 1996/1997. 

Reaching out to Experian about a credit report going back to 2008 or beyond isn’t helping as I can’t speak to a real person on the phone due them using a automated system that won’t transfer me to a customer service center to speak with someone . Or are they trying to force me to pay money by threatening court/garnishment?",15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Debt/comments/1kd5m44/law_firm_calls_saying_i_owe_capital_one_debt/,1746204186.0,icanttakethisnow,1kd5m44,advice_seeking
Debt,first home,You Can Find a way out of this. Little by little,"Just wanted to hop in here and give some encouragement to all those who feel like they are stuck. Trust me I know that the feeling is debilitating and you see no way out. There is always a way out and if I can do it anyone can. I was in debt close to $85k at the beginning of
2020. Credit cards, loans, medical, stupid spending etc. really lost control of my life for a few years (alcohol/drugs didn't help). I had basically depleted my savings and my credit was in the toilet. Debt collectors, non stop phone calls, just ignoring it and pushing it off. I had finally had enough and little by little decided to get my life back together. I just wanted to say that take it week by week, prioritize paying it down if you can and get a plan together and stick too it religiously. I don't come from money, work a blue collar job and was financially illiterate. This sub Reddit really helped me see that I wasn't alone and that there is a way out. I say all this to say, I just made my last payment Friday. I am officially debt free, and I am closing on my first home next month. I just want to let all of you know that there is a way out, I believe in all of you.",311,https://www.reddit.com/r/Debt/comments/1j2648u/you_can_find_a_way_out_of_this_little_by_little/,1740962128.0,TwixKids,1j2648u,not_advice_seeking

If I ignore the debt and bank as much as I can, I can try to save for charged off amounts? Should I save everything I can in the next six mos and try to pay off a charge-off balance?

Or… Should I try to keep some creditors in good standing and default in phases so all the reduced payoff amounts aren’t due at once? 

What would happen if I was in default all at once? Are there payment plans typically for settled on delinquent debt?

What is the worst that can happen to me?

For example, should I start no-paying on the $150k in personal loans and then pay their reduced amounts? Then wait a few months and default on the credit cards?

Debt,down payment savings,"29 yo, $145k in debt, and extremely embarrassed","Hi, so I’ve had a large amount of debt accumulate over the last few years due to lifestyle creep, unexpected car and vet bills, multiple moves, and emotional overspending. I’ve made half-assed attempts over and over to reel it in or attempt a budget and have convinced myself time and time again that I had a path forward and it’s all under control. It hasn’t been until the last few months that I’ve seriously cut down on expenses and really tracked my budget but it feels a little to late and I’m feeling extremely stressed and under water.

I make about $135k and have about $145k in debt. I rent and pay about $2k in rent and most of my remaining monthly income goes towards my debt. I’ve never missed any payments but my credit score (currently 550) has been steadily declining due to credit utilization. I have very little in savings and payments are seeming more and more overwhelming. The idea that a single unexpected expense could push me over the edge stresses me out to no end.

I’ve cut down on a lot of expenses and have even considered other cheaper living options. However I’m tied into  one more year on my lease and live in an area with a high cost of living (+ finding housing options with a dog is a bit limiting).

Here is a summary of my debts:
$35k in personal loans
$50k in federal student loans with nelnet
$60k in credit card debt

Is there a reasonable path forward here? Is bankruptcy an option? I think I can get free legal services through my employer which includes a bankruptcy lawyer. What do consultations for bankruptcy typically look like? Alternatively, is a debt management plan a reasonable option?

I’m incredibly ashamed and embarrassed that I’ve let it get to this point. I haven’t really told anyone in my life about this other then generic excuses for turning down trips,eating out, etc by saying I’m trying to save money. I’m single and don’t have any kids so this doesn’t affect anyone else negatively but I think it’s be good for my mental/emotional wellbeing to talk to someone about it but I am so embarrassed and feel very dumb. Any tips on how to broach this topic with people in my life?

UPDATE: Thanks for all the responses so far!! I’ve lurked on this sub for awhile so a lot of this is advice I’m familiar with but it’s helpful and reassuring to hear from different peoples opinions and experiences and to hear it directly. 

I plan on weighing my options by having consultations with credit counselors and bankruptcy attorneys and taking another hard look at my budget then seeing what makes the most sense. It’s still helpful to hear from individual experiences though so anything anyone can provide on how any of these routes have gone for them is appreciated!",61,https://www.reddit.com/r/Debt/comments/1kc3u7z/29_yo_145k_in_debt_and_extremely_embarrassed/,1746088461.0,Fun-Love9056,1kc3u7z,advice_seeking
Debt,down payment savings,"Crippling debt, it’s my fault","Hey everyone,
I’m a physical therapist with about $130k in student loan debt. I was originally planning to go the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) route under an Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plan, but due to a recent job change, I’m no longer eligible. (Currently making 0 dollar payments under IDR, interest obviously accruing) 

To be honest, I’m kind of freaked out. The thought of carrying this level of debt for the next 10 years is overwhelming, and I don’t want my wife to suffer financially for 7–8 years while we try to dig out of this. It feels like I’m absolutely toast either way.

We have about 27k in emergency fund savings and we’re working on a down payment for house. Do I throw half of that at the loans and maybe switch to the standard plan?

Debt,down payment savings,What Should We do About Student Debt,"Hello,

My wife and I have a student loan debt of 82k. She has been on a IDR plan for some time and switched to the SAVE plan since that would not accrue any interest. We file taxes separately so based on her income, her payment had been $0 a month for some of the years and she has put in 10 years into the IDR plan.

Well, the SAVE plan was struck down and the debt has been in forbearance for a year or so but will begin accruing interest again starting in August. I am making the argument to pay off the debt in one swoop but she wants to switch back to the IDR plan and make payments for another 10 years since it would be forgiven at that time.

We have:

100k+ in savings  
100k in investments  
100k in 401k.

Does it make sense for us to just pay off the 82k and call it a day, or should we continue down the path of IDR? Interest accrued per month will start at around $420 and obviously go up each month the balance doesnt shrink.",10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Debt/comments/1mdbrfv/what_should_we_do_about_student_debt/,1753894189.0,AdministrationTime80,1mdbrfv,advice_seeking
povertyfinance,invest $1000,I inherited a house and I don’t know what to do.,"We’re both currently barely scraping by as is. Currently juggling work and school. Both full time. My wife is also doing the same. We’re both 35, no kids and about 40k in debt. So it’s going to take us a while to pay it all off. I’m a truck driver and she does office, admin, and clerical work.

The house I received my parents signed it over to my name 12 years ago. They continued to live in it. I moved out but still visit once or twice a week. As I live maybe an hour away. My drivers license is still in that address and all my stuff goes there. As I’m in an apartment complex and I don’t want my stuff getting robbed. Mail included. It’s why I never changed my address or send things to my place.

They finally decided that’s it. They’re moving somewhere else. As they’re older and just want to be somewhere more quiet. My dad told me do whatever I want with the house. Either sell it or invest money and rent it out. I told my wife this and she’s 50/50 on both. I’m about 1000% on selling it.

Selling it would give us cash up front to pay all our debt, use as a down payment for another house as we don’t like the area they’re currently in, and purchase my own truck. As I’m a company driver and my goal is to own my own truck. I spoke to a realtor and they gave me a ballpark what I can expect to get. It’s more than enough. I spoke to my wife about all this and she said I should really consider renting it. We don’t have money to dump into the place and it’s something I just don’t wanna do it’s more money and time we just don’t have with how busy we are. I just wanna get rid of it and move on.

Given the situation. What would be the best course of action here?

Edit: the house is paid off. They signed it over to me as the sole owner because I’m the only kid that they at the time had a medical scare so they wanted it to go to me. Wife sorta wants to keep it to eventually move into it later on. I’m talking years from now like 10+. Also wants to play it safe and have it as a back up option. I on the other hand want nothing to do with all that mess and just wanna walk around with money in my pocket",172,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/1g04vpe/i_inherited_a_house_and_i_dont_know_what_to_do/,1728515310.0,Ddummyaccount,1g04vpe,advice_seeking
povertyfinance,invest $1000,Would you leave a toxic household if it meant spending more money? (Desperate),"ANY advice is appreciated.
I’m (20F) was previously homeless on and off most of my life and this is the first ‘stable’ household I’ve had since I was a young child. My *alcoholic* parent and I moved in summer 2023 and I paid the security deposit ($1250) The internet and electric is also in my name (this matters later) and i did not start receiving money from my parent until feb 2024. Since then, the money i receive from my parent is inconsistent, sometimes I’ll receive nothing or receive attitude when asked. Other times i’ll receive more than half of the rent + utilities. Before we moved in I was told I’d only be responsible for paying utilities, but my parent does not even cover rent with the money I receive. Since then I’ve had family members who mentally abused me visit as my parent gave them our address after agreeing not to. My parent smokes despite the no smoke rule, does not deep clean, an horrendously dirty carpet due to not wearing shoes in the house, and much more. When we moved in my parent financed a tv and sofa before even contributing to rent. I’ve been a depressed mess living here and I also work from home with no car so I can’t really go anywhere. My parent controls where I can go and has had overly controlled me in the past. Wont get into detail but the alcoholism makes it feel unsafe for me to utilize my parent’s transportation much. I was not allowed to get a job until I turned 18 and stayed with another family member, as my parentwould not allow me to go to the gym or out with friends etc. Overall while I dont think my parent is a bad person,  it’s mentally draining living here. My parent is also mentally unwell and will probably never seek better. We also never renewed our lease as our landlord doesnt really care as long as he gets paid. I asked my parent to ask for us to sign a new one for stability purposes and they never contacted the landlord. I send the landlord rent through a check every month and the landlord only contacts my parent. So this would make us month to month tenants. I am starting a new job making nearly 60k salary (previously made 37k and spent a few months working a second job), I don’t yet know what I’ll receive after taxes. I don’t spend a lot of money outside ordering groceries and an occasional impulsive online purchase. Right now I have 15k in my account (no investments). I have an orthodontic payment plan that totals approx 3k, a senior cat who was recently diagnosed with diabetes (vet bill was EXPENSIVE, but paid off.) Although frowned upon, i’ve also considered seeing if i can get my cat registered as an esa, as thats really the only reason i havent fully lost my mind. 

As the title implies, i’m heavily considering moving. There are some things in the way. Transportation - i dont have a car. I have my license but vehicles are too expensive, and this would make it harder as I’d have to move somewhere my affordable and probably rural. I’m also not comfortable living with roommates, I have really bad anxiety due to toxic households growing up. I won’t even eat food if people are home or awake. I also worry about noise and internet as I work from home.  This apartment is my only rental history and the state of the apartment is poor at no fault of my own which may hurt for a reference. I also know my parent is dependent on me which would be fucked up for me to leave, and i’d also leave unannounced as there would probably be anger if I announced it. I’m also enrolled in a local community college, I would probably feel more comfortable working two jobs instead of focusing on education if I moved alone. That’s also the reasoning for wanting to stay in my state. I have no family to assist as well. I’ve also considered selling and donating a large chunk of my stuff to have less to move.

Monthly Spendings
Rent: $1250 (parent sends between 0-1100 a month.. its really inconsistent)
Internet: $107
Electric: $80-250 
Phone bill $45 (phone was purchased in full in 2022) 
Subscriptions: $48.43 (apple care, google photos, icloud, target circle student, spotify student, parents tidal, crunchyroll)
Cat: $50+ (litter, diabetic food, may begin insulin) 
Groceries: $100-300, can be more expensive since I have to order delivery , sometimes I spend less and only eat what my parent buys. 
Orthodontic: $176

I do occasionally impulsive spend as I’m not used to being able to buy things, but it’s very easy to stop. (Books, video games (never more than $20, budget jewelry, second hand items, take out (canceled doordash and uber eats subscriptions already) When I had transportation I’d frequent thrift stores for items I needed.

My credit is also 740+. 

Would it be stupid to move out? I wont get my security deposit back. Also unsure if I can with both names being on the lease+ the utilities being in my name. Should I save for a car? I check used cars almost every day from dealers, private sellers etc and haven’t had luck— nor do I have anyone to go look at the car with me. My parent may also try to drive my car if I buy one. I feel as though I mentally need time alone even if it means working two jobs, and I’d like to also seek therapy. Its hard to seek it now when the problem is home.  I’ve been so miserable.  I figured if I spent a year on my own and ongoing therapy my anxiety may be good enough to seek roommates (I don’t have any friends either) 

If I did move, depending on how far I go i’d be able to spend maybe 700-1000 on rent for a one bedroom. the one bedrooms in my current area are super expensive (1.5k+) as I live near a big college. i dont have high standards outside of safety. anything feels spacious when you grew up in hotels and sleeping in cars.

povertyfinance,invest $1000,When is it safe to buy a car?,"20F asking advice. I don’t have anyone else to consult who’d understand. I apologize for the lengthy post and I hope someone can provide advice.

I’m currently working full time while enrolled in online classes at my community college. At the moment, I am only taking general education classes as I have to take in person classes due to the fact of wanting to major in engineering with no transportation to campus(In another city, requires highway transportation). For example, a bike ride would be approx 3 hours, bus ranges from 2-3 hours, and car would be 35 minutes according to google maps. This will probably bite me in the butt with a heavy course load. I do not have a car, or a way to get to and from campus in time to get to work (I work 2-11.) However, I do have  interest in pursuing engineering and even have a school in mind for transferring. 

My commute to work is slightly less than 10 mins by car. I typically have a ride to/from work and an occasional $10 uber 1-2 times a week. Nearly every place I go is a short distance from home by car.  I have also gotten a new job that I start soon that is work from home. The only downside is that if I encounter an issues at home I will have to work in the office which is an hour away. 

To sum it up; I only need a car to take in person classes and to potentially make the one hour commute if something goes wrong. I understand that everything else is not necessary.

Financial information: My wage is 17.60/hr, new wage $18.15 and  I currently have around $9000 in my checking that does not go towards any bills. I do not have any savings/investments. I rent with one other person. I usually pay at the max $1000 a month and typically lower ranges such as $700 (less if I’m lucky!) Rent is tue most major expense, I then pay for electric $50-140, internet $100 (I will be receiving a discount on it when I begin my new job), phone bill $45 (no phone payments),  approx $30 in subscriptions and a dental payment plan thats $175 and almost paid off. I have a credit score of 730, no loans, have had inquiries and no one to co-sign if I ever financed a car. My insurance would also be high as I’ve never had my own car so it shows that I don’t have a driving record. 

I’d much rather save to buy a car in full, but I don’t know when it’s safe to bite the bullet. I am extremely paranoid with spending money and feel like it’s always necessary to have money saved - I was homeless about 14 months ago and have been building from nothing. No family to help. I browse used cars from dealerships, marketplace and even craigslist regularly. I am not interested in anything new or flashy and I also do not know anything about inspecting vehicles / nor do I have anyone who can help. With a new job coming up, I have had plenty of worry about an issue coming up to where I’d have to make the one hour commute (Its approx $60> on uber/lyft) and I’m hoping to start in person classes Fall 2025. It’s also iffy as I want to save as much money as possible so I don’t have to work full time once I transfer to a university as it is very draining. Any advice is greatly appreciated. I’m even considering budgeting to the absolute max if it makes a difference.

I also work in SaaS sales with a 51k base and 100k OTE. However will probably finish the year around $70k. I’m looking for a better SaaS job as it has become crazy in micromanagement it’s almost comical, but that’s for a different thread! 

On average I’m bringing in around 6-7k a month before I close any deals. If I do close a deal it’s more like 8-10k a month NET. 

Current debt:  
ZERO credit card debt 
$17k left on car loan 
$46k private student loan debt 
$21k in government student loan debt 

Current Savings/Investments
$25,500 - AMEX HYSA 
$5100 - Acorns Invest 
$12k - Work 401k ($8.5k Vested) 
$5.8k - Checking
$1.8k - Second Checking 

Monthly Expenses: $3800


My question to the thread: What should be the goal here? Snowball debt method? Or continue to invest and simply make the payments on the debt? 

My worry is if I leave my bartending gig everything will come crashing down very fast. I need to find a better sales job but it’s okay right now. I’m worried about being burned out from both jobs. I work around 60-70hrs a week currently. 

Open to thoughts feedback and providing additional clarity!

My situation is not necessarily bad, on paper, but it all goes to shit because I live in California. My job pays 95k and I have zero-premium benefits. It's super cozy and I've worked extremely hard in a dead-end $25/hr entry level job over 5 years to be where I am.

Unfortunately I'm barely tasting the fruits of my labors, because it seems like rent prices and general cost of living in California has basically doubled since I graduated college. Back in 2020 I had $800 rent in a nice 3-bedroom apartment -- no ability to save necessarily, but all of my debts were being paid off slowly. Around 2022-ish my income became $28/hr and I was spending $1250+utils on my housing, which was a large chunk of my income at the time -- I snagged a second job just to have a safety net but that hurt my relationships because I didn't invest time there.

Fast forward to now, I am looking to rent a new place, and the area is basically $2000-2500 per month for a one bedroom with in unit laundry, a kitchen, and parking (yes, I'm aware this is very spoiled to say, so I can't exactly complain too much here). 

All this being said, I'm running out of areas to re-budget my lifestyle to make room for rent and grocery costs. I'm asking for any ideas or (gentle) criticism on my lifestyle to improve my situation.

  
This kind of turned into a weird, life story rant sort of thing but ultimately it just feels like no matter how hard I'm working my ass off, the economy just seems to keep up and keep me in the same feeling as earlier in my career. So much for my comp sci professors saying I'd be well into the 6 figures with a house before I'm 30 LOL.

  
If anyone's curious, here's my current monthly breakdown:

**Post tax/benefit income**: \~$5000  
**Necessity expenses** (rent, insurance, food, etc.): $3257  
**Car loa**n: $338  
**School loans**: \~$250, no snowball.   
Already consolidated and lowered as much as I could, but this payment will basically be here until I die with $120k still in loans across mine and my parents loans.  
**Subscriptions** (Gym, Costco, AAA): $100  
**""Fun money"":** $100  
**""Saving""** : \~$1000  
(quotes because my hobbies take up whatever I save. Currently car parts and motorcycle gear)

**Savings accoun**t: $300 (no chase fees)  
**Checking**: $100",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/1jxx22o/late20s_california_sanity/,1744509496.0,MalibuW204,1jxx22o,advice_seeking

Any advice on what to invest my money in or any smart tips to increase my savings would much appreciated.

povertyfinance,invest $1000,Help me understand the realities of saving for a house,"My girlfriend(25) & I(26) would appreciate any info/advice about the following questions & realities of saving a large chunk of money in a short amount of time. We are both fortunate enough to still live at home with essentially 0 living expenses. I’m grateful, but we never bothered to learn how to budget or save because there was no need. Regretting that now. We are both fully committed to this & willing to make any and all sacrifices, we just don’t know where or how to start. It’s not by much, but I’m better than her with finances so she has given me the green light to make a plan for us. 

I have no idea what’s relevant & what isn’t so I’ll just list everything I can think of. 

My credit score is good, 740ish & climbing. Hers is also good, but I doubt she has a long enough credit score for hers to affect much. 
We currently live in Florida.
Combined annual income is $65-70k(gratuities/performance bonuses are a factor). We both work full time, no overtime offered at either job. I make slightly more than her, but not by much. 
Combined monthly recurring expenses are roughly $1000. 
Total combined debt is roughly 20k, stemming mainly from 2 car loans. 
No children/dependents
I have about $500 in a roth ira(Robinhood). I also put a recurring $20/week into a medium risk acorns account because I want to invest but have no idea how to diversify past dumping it all in an ETF. I know it’s probably dumb but I use that account as an emergency fund & it was liquidated recently. She has no savings.
We both have supportive & successful(middle/upper middle class) families willing to help, but we want to do this on our own as much as possible. 



Questions:
1. What is the best savings/investment account that is not easily touched, but will be readily available when we’re ready to start house shopping?

2. Is it possible to get joint access to it without being married, & both be able set up automatic weekly/monthly recurring investments?

3. Based on our current financial situation, what is a realistic number that those recurring payments should be if we want a down payment ready in 1 year, 2 years, 5 years? I know this will vary wildly based on the quality of the house & real-estate market in the state/area we choose, but I’m hoping that some of y’all who are smarter and more articulate than I am can paint a picture for me. 

If it makes it any easier, you can use a baseline of $200k to calculate as that’s about the minimal going price of houses in our area that we would be comfortable buying, but calculations based on numbers + - 150k along with that would definitely help in finalizing a number to shoot for. 


If I left anything important out please lmk, I’m an open book. Any and all help is appreciated. Thank you for reading.

povertyfinance,small windfall,Can anyone offer hope?,"Hi All, sorry this is a bit long.

**The Situation:**

The last few years have been tough. My wife (37F) and myself (38M) had our first child in June of 2020 during peak pandemic panic and scarcity. We have both been laid off since the pandemic and have both found jobs that are pretty stable. We had our second child in 2022, and it feels like we've been trying to keep our heads above water ever since. 

I've never had a 401k, and only in the last few months set up a Roth IRA that I'm contributing to twice per month. I know this is late, but have never felt the ability to actually put much away in the past. 

Pre-kids we had a small savings egg, but ran through that during the lay-off times. We are currently paying $400/week for day care (this will go down to $250/week in the fall when our oldest begins Kindergarten, and eventually $0/week when our youngest begins kindergarten in 2028ish. We're hoping the change of  We have relied on credit cards to keep ourselves afloat in the meantime, but have accumulated around $35,000 in CC debt. 

**Now the positive:**

Since the kids have been born, we've both upgraded to newer safer vehicles, with lower miles that will not need to be replaced or fixed (fingers crossed) as often in the future. We purchased a new house to accommodate our growing family in the winter of 2021, and while more expensive than our last, it is a much better neighborhood, with better schools, and more space for us to live as a family of 4. As such, we likely won't be needing to relocate in the near future, and can envision ourselves in this house for a very long time. 

The windfall of daycare expense going away will represent a $600/month swing for us in the coming months, which will feel huge.

I've never had a 401k or retirement savings, but in the last few months set up a Roth IRA that I'm contributing to twice per month. I know this is late, but have never felt the ability to actually put much away in the past. 

I am a 15% owner in the company that I work for, and will continue to grow my stake yearly for the next several years. I am currently working a side gig as a contractor at an up and coming company that is excited for big things. I am evaluating getting another PT time to help in the meantime. My wife doesn't have the ability to work an extra job as her works hours are more rigid than mine.

This month we are beginning the Avalanche Approach to debt payoff to hopefully be free of CC debt by April of 2029.

**What's The Ask?:**

I feel like I'm wasting the brief time I have with my kids as children on being stressed all the time. We don't do vacations, we don't get out to eat, we live frugally, and still feel very very tight each month. This constant financial strain is taking it's toll on me as a person and as a father. I feel like I've somehow f\*d up my life and my kid's lives by not being more financially free, and my inability to be in a better position means that they don't get the childhoods that they deserve. 

All that's to say-- I know I'm not an outlier here, and that the majority of middle class americans are struggling and taking on debt right now. 

**All I'm asking for is some hope.** Have you been in my situation but come out on the other end? Can someone please reassure me that I haven't ruined my life and that it won't feel like this forever? Can someone give me some hope that I still have a chance to retire someday? 

**TL;DR: I walk around all day in a fog, nagged by my feelings of guilt, shame, and failure surrounding the financial state of my young family. I know that no one can see the future, but can someone tell me it'll get better? I just want to hear from someone who has been in my shoes and ended up on the other side.** 

**TIA!!!**

povertyfinance,small windfall,Taz return- what do I use it for?,"I have my tax return coming in at the end of Feb- its $965.  I'm trying to figure out what the best use for it is. This is long, so much gratitude if you're willing to read and offer input!

I currently make 1200/month. It's a full time job but with a school so I only am earning income from it 9 months a year and that's divided into paychecks thru the summer.  Budget is REALLY tight. Barely making it happen with just paying for necessities. 

Here are some of my considerations for the money 

- my brother's wedding is in May. I still am needing to get a gift for him and my future sister in law for the wedding. I'm sharing a hotel room with my mom and she has said she is ok to cover that expense in full since she knows I don't make much. But i will need to cover my own food while we are up there, tho the plan is to do that mainly through groceries as opposed to eating out and I have government food benefits. 

- I am currently getting to work via my dad driving me and me reimbursing for gas. I don't have my license but do have my learners permit and I'm actively learning how to drive. My aunt and uncle have an old car they're planning to gift me when I get my license. The cost for gas would honestly improve since I would not be paying  for my dad to also come pick me up (this alone would save about 150/month). The car has a cost of $75 liability insurance I would be responsible for once it's mine, plus the cost of any maintenance it ever ends up needing. 

- I have 2 cats, and as those with pets likely know they can have unexpected high expenses, so I'm considering putting a little extra into my ""cat fund"", which is a prepaid credit card that I put $50 per paycheck on. One cat is due for her well visit and vaccines end of March (I've already put a $50 deposit for the appt), and the other is due end of September. They're both young and in generally good health, though both have a congenital condition, Cerebellar Hypoplasia. One of them (the one due for her visit in September) does have mild asthma and is prone to the inside of her ears getting dirty, zero clue why on the ears. 

- I have about $4100 in debt (not factoring in my 24k of student loans)  Approx 3500 is debt that is in collections from when I was dealing with a disabling health condition and unable to work and also had a bad now-ex partner who wasnt contributing their share but im unlikely to see a penny of it from then and would prefer to move on. I would really, really like to be free of this debt as soon as I can. 

- I'm trying to build up saving in a HYS account. It has 26 bucks in it right now so it's slow going. But I have an initial goal to work towards it being a 5k emergency fund. I'm looking to go back to school to become a special education teacher and part of that would be 16 weeks of likely unpaid student teaching so I would really like to be able to build savings as high as possible to prep for that time. There would also likely be financial expenses associated with being a college student again. 

- in about a year and half, I'm planning to relocate to the other side of the state (about 3 hours away), so having money to be able to do that would be beneficial, though I know that's a while off.  

- I will also say I spend no money on myself at this point due to tight finances. Should any of this go towards an outing with friends or something of the sort? 

I will say, I'm planning to work over the summer to further work towards my financial goals. Ideally, I would earn enough to live on from summer work and my paychecks from my FT job could go directly towards savings or debt repayment.

povertyfinance,what to do with extra money,"My parents are poor and it’s ruining mine and my sisters lives, I really don’t know what to do.","Hi all, i’m 24 years old (M) and live in the UK. Sorry for the long winded post but just want to provide the whole story..

I grew up in a family that never really had much money, parents always struggled to pay bills, always getting into debt etc etc. Me being the oldest of 4 children, I knew that I needed to do something to change my family’s situation so I pursued entrepreneurship at a young age and started my first online business at 17. This business over years got to a point where I was making around £7/8,000 a month at 19/20 years old and whilst living at home my money was stacking up very fast and with that the money problems started.

Ever since I got my first part time job at 16 i was helping my parents financially (in fact even before that I helped by letting my parents sell my gaming consoles and video games to pawn shops so they had money to buy food) - I remember going on one of the first few dates with my girlfriend who I met at 17 (and still with to this day) and I was trying to withdraw money from the bank to get the bus to see her but my account was in negative because I paid a bill for my parents so I went back home upset and had to explain to my girlfriend (who wasnt my gf at the time) the situation so she ended up paying for me to come and see her etc.

Fast forward to a few years ago, I was giving my parents lots of money and paying off all their debts because I thought this would ease their financial struggles (£4k debt here, £5k debt there, £2k debt here and so on). I bought them a new TV, fridge freezer, washing machine, even bought my dad a car for £12k because his previous car would always break down and I thought if I got him this car they wouldnt have to deal with this problem as well as keep on spending money to fix the car.

Now in the past couple of years, inflation has caused them to be even worse off financially and it’s got to the point where I was giving them £1.5-£2k every single month for about a year (2023-2024ish). On top of this my sister (23) who works mainly hospitality jobs gives my parents half of her wages usually sometimes more. She saved up £5k for her first car but over the past year has given it all to my parents and it caused her to be really upset and come to me to talk about things but I honestly didn’t really know what to say to help her because i have been in the same boat but for much longer. I also have a 17 year old brother who doesn’t care to get a job (video game addict) and a 14 year old brother who of course is a kid he needs to be provided for!

My mum works long hours in quite low paying jobs (sometimes 12 hour days) and is always picking up extra work where she can to try and make ends meet but its still not enough. At one point she was working 3 jobs but now she works the same hours but only in 1-2 jobs. My dad works not even full time and earns around £1100 a month and says he doesnt want to change jobs because “he likes his job” and as he is in his early 60’s always talks about how he’s “getting old now” so i dont think he would go and get a better job or anything. He also has to drive alot in his job and spends alot on petrol (I always ask my mum how much and she avoids the question) and he only gets the tiniest amount reimbursed so his actual pay after the petrol is probably alot less than £1100. I calculated if he worked in a supermarket (or similar) full time he would earn a few hundred more than what he currently does but I think he is very stubborn and hard to talk to so my mum doesnt even bring it up to him.

I at one point had over 100k in my bank account and through giving them probably £70k+ over the past 4/5 years as well as a couple of bad decisions on my own behalf, being young and not understanding taxes properly, I got into around £30k tax debts which I have over the past couple of years somehow got down to owing only a few thousand now.

I ended up moving out with my girlfriend around 6 months ago and fortunately my girlfriend now has her own online business and is doing very well (8k+ a month usually) so she has been paying all of our rent for the past 6 months and all i’ve been able to contribute is some small bills and some food since all my money goes to paying tax, giving parents money (been around £600-700 a month in recent months) as well as paying for my own petrol and things like gym membership etc.

Also my income has went down significantly earning around £3-4k a month usually but I want to make more money (my goals have always been 10-20k+ a month from my business) but my relationship with money is quite bad so it’s almost like I despise/shy away from making more money nowadays.

In my ideal world I want to contribute to my apartment with my gf, maybe even be the main provider so she can just stack up her money. I want my parents to not worry about money. I want my sister to be able to progress in life (buy a home, travel more, have my own family one day and give them a life free of financial stress) 

All of this leads to me believing the only way out of this is if I make way more money through an online business myself (I will never let my gf help my parents financially, this line will never be crossed) There is the possibility of me “cutting off” parents financially or even just not speaking to them but I am too caring and it hurts me to see other people suffer - really affects my mental health badly.

My relationship with my mum (who is the person who asks me for money. I think most of the time my dad doesn’t even know that me or my sister have given money) has mainly become her constantly asking to “borrow” money even though I say to her I don’t want it back because the next month they’ll just be in the same position asking for money. (I have provided a screenshot of searching on my messages “borrow” blurring out names for privacy - these messages are basically every othet day £10 here, £50 there, £15 here, £20 there)

Honestly I don’t know what to do, it feels like a vicious cycle I have been in for all my adult life give or take. I speak to my girlfriend every day about these things but it feels like I can’t come to a solution.

povertyfinance,what to do with extra money,Haven't been to Subway in 3 years. Had a coupon so finally went. Lady in front of me spent $26 on a lunch meal for herself like it was no big deal. What planet are we on?,"Ok, shit is bananas out there. Straight up bananas.

I literally haven't ate at a Subway sandwich place in probably 3 years. Only reason I went yesterday is because I didn't have anything ready to eat or cook for lunch, and didn't have time. I remembered that I had Subway coupon that somebody left at my work (A lady leaves coupons on a table in our office breakroom for anybody to use).

Even the coupon prices seemed insane to me. But they did have one for $4.99 (for a 6-inch sub).

So, I go to Subway, and I'm standing in line waiting, and this lady in front of me got a footlong combo, and the total was like $26.89. For ONE PERSON! This isn't a sit down restaurant. What the hell is going on. The lady literally had a $20 bill in her hand, and she had to dig in her purse to get another 10 dollar bill. In what world does this happen?

But she didn't seem to flinch about it. I'd be in tears. (Well truthfully, I'd never be doing it...)

I got my 6-inch, and gave the cashier my coupon. My total was $4.99 exactly. No tax, because I didn't get it toasted or anything. My sub didn't have any hot stuff. I gave the lady a $5 bill and got back a penny.

Honestly, I still feel like I got ripped off a little bit, but it's mind boggling that people can drop $26.89 on a freaking sandwich. 

Why not go to a sit down restaurant and have a proper meal?

There's a wonderful sit-down Mexican restaurant that I sometimes treat myself to, and even with tip and everything, I'm out of there for a little less than that. Real, quality food, and I'm always taking leftovers with me.

I feel like people are living in one of two worlds and there's no in-between. Either you have $$$ or you don't. If you don't, you stay at home and cook stuff and scrap to survive. If you got money, you do dumb stuff like drop $26.89 on lunch for yourself at a crappy place like Subway.

NOTE: For those wondering why her order cost so much, she got a footlong combo, but she also added avocado to an order that normally doesn't come with it, and there was an extra charge for that.

As I was walking to my car, I started to get really depressed. I'm not dating right now, because I don't have the money to take anybody on dates. But I was thinking... *""Man, eventually when I start dating, what if I'm with somebody and they just want to stop at Subway to get something, and 5 years ago that wouldn't have been a life-changing event, but now, it can literally break my entire budget. How the hell am I ever going to be able to date somebody?""*

I guess I won't. 

Sometimes when I wake up in the morning I'm really disappointed that I'm back in this real life. I wish I could just stay asleep. What's the fucking point of it all?

UPDATE: Lots of people in the comments are getting on me for judging the lady in front of me. I actually wasn't judging her in any way. I was just commenting on the absurdity of the entire situation. Yeah, I did say, if you're going to spend that much, why not go to a legit sit down restaurant, but I didn't really mean that as a comment to her specifically.

povertyfinance,what to do with extra money,We’re drowning financially and I don’t know what to do anymore,"

I’m writing this because I honestly don’t know what else to do. My family is struggling—really struggling—and I could use advice, support, or maybe just to not feel so alone in this.

My husband just earned his associate degree in veterinary medicine and is working as a veterinary assistant, making $22 an hour. He hasn’t been able to study for his licensing exam to become a licensed vet tech because he’s been dealing with severe depression and mental health challenges. He was doing Uber on the side to help us stay afloat, but lately he hasn’t been in a place mentally to keep up with that either.

I work full time in an administrative leadership role and make $30 an hour. For a while, we were surviving solely on my income while my husband wasn’t working, and everything spiraled. Our $2,500/month mortgage was hard enough to cover alone, and now we’re two months behind on our car loan. Our credit is completely wrecked, and so many of our bills are now in collections.

We have two kids, and I’m trying to pick up Uber Eats in the evenings after my full-time job, but honestly, I’m probably losing money with gas and wear on the car. I’m desperately trying to find a second job I can work for just 2-3 hours in the evening after my husband gets home, but it’s tough to find something that fits that window.

To make things worse, we owe more on our car than it’s worth, so I don’t even know what our options are with that. Surrendering it might still leave us in a hole we can’t climb out of.

We are trying. We really are. But everything feels like it's falling apart faster than we can catch it. If anyone has any suggestions—part-time jobs that are actually worth it, ways to negotiate with lenders, ideas to make a little extra money from home in the evenings—I’m open to anything.

Thank you for reading. I just needed to say it out loud.

i have not eaten more than ramen noodles for the past 3 months. i work two jobs. but guess what? my car broke down, and i can no longer even transport to work to pay these bills without dropping $50 on an uber per trip or $100 for a car rental daily. i'm facing the option of turning my car in and getting a loan on top of that money to even get a new car, or throwing all my savings into repairing it (plus a loan!!)

  
oh, i guess it must have been those $5 coffees!

throughout the months i have had to pull into my savings because bills went up, or shit has been happening around me. at most after every month i could only save $50. and where is that now? you guessed it! i am going to have to sell things that i have diligently saved up for to afford my apartment.

my 1st job was a sheetz supervisor working $19 an hour, only half a year ago. i worked that job for 2.3 years but found i was disappointed in myself, i felt depressed there, because i was stuck working fast food. so i went and was looking for another job, found something for $17 an hour as a night auditor! it felt great to not have to tell people that i worked in fast food, and that i was actually building skills that would allow me to apply to higher paying jobs in the future! i kept my job at sheetz (downgrading to $16 as a team member) because while i knew the supervisor role was more money in the end, it made me feel horrible, stressed, and depressed! so here i am, working the two jobs, one for career building and the second for extra cash

  god forbid i make one mistake in this economy. god forbid i try new things to make myself feel better, that things can go well for just a few months so i can start building that savings, finally !

povertyfinance,what to do with extra money,What do you do about social functions where you have to bring food?,"Some very well meaning ladies at my church just signed me up for the church potluck to bring dessert, and while I appreciate the gesture, the reason I didn’t sign myself up was that I can’t afford to make something to bring! It’s supposed to be all homemade stuff so I can’t just get something cheap at the store, and I just don’t have room in my budget for things like butter and coco powder! I already bought groceries for the week and I really wasn’t prepared for an extra expense. 

Everybody at my church is very sweet, but they’re also predominantly older middle class folks, who don’t realize that what costs a little to them is a lot to people like me!

Edit: I understand everyone’s impulse to say “fuck you” to the person who signed me up involuntarily, but that’s just not how I wanna play this. 
1) I truly don’t blame anyone. Yes, they sometimes aren’t very class considerate, and forget that we are not all middle class with money to spare, but at they end of the day, they just wanted me there for an event, and I appreciate that.
2) even if I did want to say “the hell with it,” like it or not, this is the community I live in, and making enemies won’t do me any good.

My husband works for himself but it just isn’t enough money. To be completely honest, I don’t even know what he makes. I cant keep living like this. I make some money from Etsy and tiktok, but it’s not enough. It usually ends up having to go to groceries. I need to get my car registered and can’t afford it. It’s 3 years expired. I need new glasses. Our dryer has been broken for over 2 months. So many old bills that went unpaid that were in my name are now hitting my credit. I’m so stressed everyday. It’s all I can think about.  I have been cutting out all extra costs like Netflix or buying the occasional Starbucks. I can’t help but feel like a failure because I’m not giving my kids the same quality of life I had growing up.
I need to find a way to make more money. I don’t live near my family anymore because he moved us here a year ago for work and most of the time he works out of town so I’m just completely alone with the kids 80% of the time. It’s a rural area of the US so job opportunities are slim to none. I’m tired of feeling like I’m drowning and need help.

povertyfinance,what to do with extra money,Fees on top of fees for apartment living. Smh.,"I'm downsizing into an apartment because my landlord is increasing the rent and I can no longer afford rent, power, natural gas, water, sewer, trash, pest control and lawn maintenance. (Landlord says he hates to lose a good tenant but he has no choice because of rising costs). I'm searching, and the fees are OUTRAGEOUS. There are fees for the fees. I've seen parking fees (What do you mean I have to pay to park my car outside of the place where I pay RENT?!?), mandatory valet trash fees (I'll take my own trash to the dumpster for free), amenity fees (it's called RENT), common area charges (What is this--I'm paying my rent to STAY in MY apartment), etc. It's CRAZY to me. One complex even said they charge $50 extra per month for the washer/dryer that come with the apartment. I mentioned I have my own and they said all tenants have to use theirs.

povertyfinance,what to do with extra money,I’m looking for a job and nobody is paying a living wage.,"I am a 46 year old female. I’ve bartended my whole life, and I am done with that. I can’t do that anymore. After a string of bad relationships, I am left homeless and jobless. I do have a reliable car and I do have a lot of skills and experience I’ve gotten throughout the years. I’m a hard worker. I’m reliable. I’m easy to get along with. I’m smart. I don’t have a college education. I have a high school diploma and it’s just been a nightmare looking for a job that I can afford to live on. Plus with the inflation and everything that cost so much now, I don’t see how I can do it. How can I do it? Where do I start? I’m basically living in my car right now. It’s impossible and it seems like I shouldn’t even try. all the jobs that I can get and qualify for are all $15 an hour maybe.  There is no way I can live on that. What do I do?

Update: 

So, I caught a break when I started cleaning for my aunt. She was 72 years old and had bladder and kidney cancer, arthritis, a pace maker and a bunch of other ailments. She was all alone and couldn’t clean her house properly. She could do dishes and laundry and maybe sweep sometimes but that was it. She had called my dad and asked about me and asked if I could cone help her which I immediately did. After only a few times cleaning for her and seeing how we got along so well she asked me to move in with her. I absolutely agreed. 
It came to be that I didn’t have to pay rent and she actually paid my phone bill every month and she would fill up my tank in my car sometimes too. She bought all the groceries and toiletries. I on the other hand took care of her. I did all the grocery shopping, took her to all her doctors appointments. I would pick up her bag of prescriptions at the pharmacy, I deep cleaned her house by washing all the walls and all of her hutches and Knick knacks and windows and used a carpet cleaner for her carpet, I took care of of her cat, I made all the meals, I worked on the outside of her house before it got too cold, I helped her get rid of a lot of clutter she had  which I was so proud of her for being able to do. I made her bed everyday, got her organized and most of all we would just sit at her dining room table drinking coffee and taking and laughing. We had a lot in common. We quickly became best friends.  It was a great set up for both of us. I would Instacart when I could to have extra money for myself. Perfect. 
On December 22 we woke up in the afternoon. (She was a night owl and so was I.) 
I went into her room and she looked really bad. She said she had been having trouble breathing. I asked her if she wanted me to call an ambulance. She said no. I asked her if she wanted me to take her to the doctor. She said no. She asked me to get her her medicine and a bottled water which I did. She was still in bed so after she took her medicine I put her oxygen back in her nose and told her I was gonna go outside and smoke and then do the dishes and come up and check on her. She said okay so I went downstairs. 
I did my thing then headed up to check on her only to see that she was in the bathroom, on her back and her eyes were open. I called her name a few times. No rrsponse. I ran over to her and started shaking her, calling her name. No response. I then run downstairs to get my phone and call 911 and explain the situation. The 911 lady told me I should start CPR and I told her I have never done CPR. She told me she would instruct me. Okay. So I start that and am counting out loud so the 912 lady can hear me, meanwhile I am crying and almost hyperventilating and I’m worried I’m not doing the CPR right when finally the paramedics get there and take over so I get out of there way and go downstairs. They were working on her for at least 30 mins when one of the paramedics comes down and I ask what’s going on up there and he said it’s not good. 10 mins later he comes down and says they called her death. 
They wouldn’t let me upstairs to see her. They said they didn’t want me to see her like that, but when the funeral home came to get her, they brought her down with her head visible so I could say good bye to her and so I did. I just cried and cried. It was a very traumatic thing for me to go thru. I had never dealt with death or seeing a loved one on the floor like that and having to push on her chest……
Anyways, I stayed at the house for 2 weeks getting all her papers together, looking for a will, which she didn’t have one I guess cause I never found one. Her estate went to her other two older nieces and I got my eviction notice. The landlord was on my ass to get out and really I didn’t want to stay there cause I started having trouble sleeping and had to keep the bathroom door shut at all times cause I didn’t wanna look in and see her laying there or have flashbacks about it. Anyways, the nice landlord had the cops call me and ask me to prove my residence there by a piece of mail I had sent there which I didn’t cause I had a P.O. Box from being homeless which I didn’t even think about changing, so I decided to get out asap. It was however Ohio. In the middle of January and I was scared at the thought of living in my car when it’s so cold out. 
I reached out to my ex boyfriend and he said I could come stay with him. He lives in the Columbus area. I agreed and that is when I am right now. 
He is so abusive and mean to me that is why I left him in the first place but I made a conscious decision to come here because it is better than living in your car in January. It is better than living in a homeless shelter. It is really hard tho. Not only is abusive and every day he makes sure to make me feel his hate and contempt for me and how I can’t do anything right but he has a raging gambling addiction which he is a slave to and he pays the rent and the utilizes but after that every single penny of his paycheck goes to the casino. He makes great money. He is an electrician in the union but he has never and will never spend a dime on me and he lives like he is barely making it when he could have a really nice lifestyle. But no. Even when he wins, all that goes right back to the casino as well. He hid this from me for a couple years before I found out about it and by that time his abuse and neglect towards me was so bad I left. Hence my homelessness and hard times ever since. 
I have been Instacartimg to feed myself and buy the things I need and my phone bill and my car insurance etc….. 
I have been on Indeed every single day, I had A1 update and fix my resume so it is up to date and better than what it ever has been and all I want is to get a job to save money and get out of here. There is my problem. I cannot for the life of me get a job. I’ve had a couple interviews and nothing.  I want a livable wage job and those are really hard to find so I’ve decided to take any job and I still can’t get hired. I am about ready to crawl in a hole and go to sleep and never wake up. I am just tired. In May my little dog of 14 years walked out the door never to be seen or heard from again and tbh, that has been the hardest thing for me to deal with. I just can’t believe she is gone and the not knowing what happened to her is even harder. I have never felt more alone in my entire life and my aunt wasn’t supposed to leave me so soon and now I’m stuck with this complete abusive gambling addicted asshole and can’t get a job and just can’t see any good anymore and I’m tired of the shit sandwiches life keeps force feeding me. 
I just need a job to save money to get  a place of my own but even if I accept a low, minimum wage job and save the money, I won’t be able to sustain a place with that low income job so now I’m back to square one again. I am done with this system. I am done with politicians and their total ignorance on reality and I’m tired of these slave wages and im tired of nobody understanding and im tired of having to fight for survival and at least a meal and a warm place to lay my head every night when i have worked my ass off, paid my taxes, I am not a criminal and I’m a good citizen of this country and I guess me and my situation have just fallen thru the cracks. I can’t catch a break to save my life and the struggle is 100% real. 
I’m sorry for the venting and ranting. I just don’t know what to do anymore and living with this complete asshole is making things 100 times worse and I just can’t find a way out. 
If anyone is in the Columbus area and can direct me to a job or has things I can do for them or help them, please lmk. Please. I can’t take it here much longer.

povertyfinance,bonus invest,I officially paid off one of my credit cards last night to kick off 2025 and I've never felt more excited in my life ,"I'm sure this has happened to a few of us, where you lived off credit cards because of COVID or other extremely hard times where you had no choice. For me, it was COVID. Long time unemployed during the pandemic lead me to credit cards and unfortunately I still have that debt... but something changed last night. 

I've posted on here before about losing my old receptionist job and starting a new banking job that's extremely close to me and helps pay the bills even better. After some time at the job now, I've been feeling incredible. 

Bills are being paid on time. Money can be tight but I'm not overdrafting nearly as often (i get the occasional date didn't line up with payday overdraft, but I usually am able to fix it), I'm working hard and getting paid for it. The company is already putting in motion removing the bonus incentive program for my position and instead putting it into our base pay for 2025 on top of our yearly raises! I've been able to slowly save money. I'm investing gently into my retirement. I'm working on investing a little into my company's employee stock purchase plan for another form of investing money. I'm working so unbelievably hard to make it all happen and I feel like it's paying off.

Not too long ago I was feeling immense amounts of despair and the crushing weight of financial stress. Things are hard. They're not perfect, but they're looking up. I'm putting my nose to the grindstone and figuring out how to fix all this. It's not an easy thing to figure out and I'm very fortunate I've gotten this far. I'm so thankful and so excited to start off 2025 with just a little bit of hope.

Bills lined up perfectly, I had the extra cash plus my savings to be able to combine to pay off one card. I'll have to build my savings again, but doing it to slowly get myself put of debt is worth it. Now I can pay a little more each month to another debt, and then add a small bit extra to my savings. 

Things are not easy. But they're getting there. I know some of you have read my old posts here and given me support and advice. I'm eternally greatful for your support. I hope 2025 can be kinder to you all, and I hope to reappear every now and again to share more success with you all.

povertyfinance,bonus invest,Should I take out a loan to payoff my payday loans?,"Hi All! 


Disclaimer: I’m not great at making smart money choices so I want to make sure I’m making the right choice going into the New Year. 


In August of this year, I took out a few payday loans to finance an unexpected expense. I’d initially wanted to take out a standard loan but my credit didn’t qualify me at the time. I’d always heard bit the best things about payday loans but never really understood why. 


Fast forward to 4 months of paying them off and re-loaning, and getting myself stuck in that cycle - I see why now. I’m paying $900 (give or take) in interest on a monthly basis. I find myself need to re-loan cause I can’t meet my monthly expenses. I recently paid off one loan in full without re-loaning, but still have two in rotation. 


My credit went up in that past few months, now qualifying me for a loan with a decent APR%. I’m considering taking that out to pay off the payday loans once and for all. Bonus because my partner and I are looking to start a new business in the new year, so half of the loan can go into paying off debt, and the other half into investing. It sounds (to me) practical on paper but honestly speaking, I’m scared of loans at this point and don’t want to find myself in more of a spot. Anything I’m not considering? Am I better off just taking the long road to paying off the payday loans and keeping the business stuff separate?

povertyfinance,bonus invest,"""Upgrade your Skills"" ","I mean, as someone who's been in the workforce over half their life out of necessity, dropped out of university because I ran out of money, and only in the last 5 years started make over $50k, I'm curious how the heck I'm supposed to move forward. 

I don't hate my job and definitely feel like my middle-management wages were competitive pre-Covid...but the raises and bonuses that came these last few years havent been cutting it with the way the economy has gone. I can't deny that 8-10 months of the year is really nice for me -- and that I'm probably paid too much for what I do when it's slow -- but peak season has me all wrung out and wondering if this is all I got for the next 30 years. TFSAs and HISAs can't be the only thing I could be doing, right?

Two schools of thought are to jump ship every few years and chase higher wage bands that way. The other is to invest in yourself and pivot into a new direction. 

I feel like I have a good opportunity for the second when work is slow, but have no idea where to even begin. I know I have some transferrable skills & experience, but I think my actual lack of working in different environments would sink me if I tried my hand at something new. Building on what I do know feels like the right move, and knowing I have some connections with people higher up in my company does put my mind at ease, but outside of those few people, I know that I'm just another employee in the grand scheme of things.

My question;

How does a full time, working adult upgrade their skills? Going back to school seems expensive and time consuming. Chasing dreams feels out of the question if my goal is ultimately financial stability.

Looking for advice/experiences from people who've had some success here. Was thinking of posting on that other PFC, but feel some of those responses would just be out of touch.

povertyfinance,bonus invest,Worried about financial future for myself and my fiancé ,"
Me and my partner of over 10 years got engaged late summer this year, which is super exciting! We’re both musicians & audio engineers (they’re a full-time freelancer) and my day job is WFH with side gigs as a vocalist/keyboard player. In addition, we run a home recording studio from our apartment. We both live in one of the most expensive cities in the world, but I was born and raised here and have no plans on leaving or desire to live anywhere else. All that said, some things have me a little worried as we’ve experienced some major changes since our engagement late summer:

-For our wedding plans, we decided to forgo a party and just do a courthouse wedding instead followed by an intimate dinner with our parents and siblings. Would rather save for our honeymoon. We crunched the numbers and decided there is no way we can afford to pay for even the cheapest of wedding parties if we wanted a honeymoon. 

-Work was on the light side this year and I didn’t get a bonus. I work for a small company and while I could get paid better, I really like what I do as it’s adjacent to my skills as a musician. I got a raise this year, but with COL + inflation going up exponentially, it doesn’t feel like much.

-My side gigs were about the same if not more than what I made last year, but again with COL and inflation it feels like I’m taking home less.

-We have a roommate and they’re moving out earlier than discussed for next year, which complicates our timeline in terms of financial planning since January & February is usually a dry season for freelancers. 

-My fiancé plans on selling gear to help pay for the rent adjustment before and after the roommate moves out. Neither of us want to sell this gear but it is what it is. I worry about how they will make up for this rent increase as we don’t want to have another roommate. 

Things I have been doing to keep a tighter budget in preparation for what’s to come next year is:

-Take more public transit rather than cabs

-Meal plan to prevent food indecisiveness and buying takeout. Utilize my pantry and leftovers as much as possible to minimize food waste. Purchase pantry items and essentials in bulk with my parents warehouse club membership. 

-Assess what subscription services I need to cancel

-Be more diligent on paying my credit card debts to keep a low balance


Things I plan to do to make more money:

-Sell things I no longer need that are in good condition (clothes, electronics, etc.)

-Attend more networking events in the hopes of getting leads for clients

-Try to land better paying singing gigs

-Ask for a bigger raise next year at work, or start scouting for a better paying job with my skill set

Even with all this said and tentatively planned, I feel stressed and I’m trying my best not to lash out at my partner bc they are also under immense pressure and we’ve already discussed how they plan on making more money (taking on private students & clients for our home recording studio, etc.). One more thing I wanted to mention but has moved at the bottom of my priorities are my music projects. Because I have to focus on surviving, the thought of not having the funds to invest in my music makes me incredibly sad as I pay my band members out of pocket for every gig, unless we earn $$ in ticket sales or I manage to win grant money. 

I’m frustrated and maybe it’s the holiday blues that’s exacerbating it.

I just needed to share this win somewhere. I've been lurking on this sub for about 2 years and finally have something worth posting!

For context, I came to the US from the UK for college about 6 years ago. Met my spouse during sophomore year, fell in love, got married after graduation, and decided to stay in the States. The international student loans plus the wedding costs put me about $15k in credit card debt spread across 3 cards. I was making minimum payments and watching that balance barely move while the interest kept piling up.

Being an immigrant made things extra challenging - had to figure out the US credit system from scratch, navigate work visas, and couldn't get family help because they're all back in the UK. Plus the exchange rate between dollars and pounds has been brutal.

Last year, I finally:

* Got serious about budgeting
* Cut out all unnecessary subscriptions
* Started meal prepping instead of ordering takeout
* Picked up weekend gig work when possible
* Applied the snowball method to my debt

That AMEX payment you see (-$2,741.46) was my FINAL credit card payment. I'm officially debt free for the first time in my adult life!

Seeing that $6,555.84 balance literally made me cry. I've never had more than $1,000 in my account before this moment.

povertyfinance,getting started investing,I have no one else to tell this to,"So I’ve (29M) been through training for machining as well as basic engineering principles. I was working for a company modifying PLC enclosures for a few years (for shitty pay I might add) when a friend reached out to me and offered me some part time hours at a startup they were involved in at the time. Fast forward about 4 months and they offer me a full time position, that pays better than the PLC shop, is less physical labor, has normal working hours, and great benefits, including incentivized stock options that I’ve been buying here and there with my spare change. I’d have to be dumb to not make the jump. When I started here part time, my salary was about $20/hour as opposed to the $17/hour I was getting to run and program a CNC machine (which is crazy to me). I’ve been at the new job for almost three years now and really tried to invest myself in my work, and I’ve learned a lot. I’ve created several parts while here that have helped in production, and the company always praised me, as well as provided financial compensation.

 I never really thought that the contributions I was making were all that special, but we just had our most recent six month review, and my managers and bosses had nothing but great things to say, and referenced my parts multiple times throughout. They then proceeded to tell me that they were happy to announce I would be receiving a raise, as well as a title change if I wanted it.. y’all.. I was not ready to hear what they were about to lay on me. When they said I’d be getting a raise, I expected a two or three dollar difference.. then they busted out the whiteboard and markers and wrote my current salary on it ($49,000 and some change annually). Then underneath it, they slowly started writing the new salary, but backwards.

First, a 0, then 5, another 5, followed by a 6…. And finally, after what seemed like minutes, they wrote the last number. A six. So after three years of hard work, I’m going from just under $50,000 annually, to $66,550. To say I almost cried is an understatement. I’ve seen people get a 10-20 thousand dollar increase annually while searching for new jobs, but I never thought it would happen to me, let alone not have to change jobs to achieve it…

My wife (23) and I (26) have piled up an unbelievable amount of debt in the last 5 years and decided that 2025 would be the year we officially start to get serious. We just had our first son and dream of owning a house one day, so we're diving into the new year with pay-offs in mind.

I'm hoping that posting my progress each month will help continue to motivate me to drive this debt down faster, even if only one or two people see how it goes.

I currently have three jobs, my primary income, a second part-time job, and I'm in the National Guard. I also do some coding on the side for extra money. My wife is a stay at home mom and is currently working on getting a work-from-home job.

Each month I will try to include any developments that have affected our debt in a negative or positive way, but I will not be making excuses for bad behavior.

We are not homeless, food-less, or in as bad of a situation as we could otherwise be; we just suck with money and want to be in a better situation.

Some context for the chart:

\- The credit card debt is spread between 7 different cards with 2k-5k balances.

\- The short term loan debt is two personal loans

\- The long term loan debt is student loans, car loans, and one debt consolidation loan

\- The ""other"" debt is medical bills

\- The 401a and 457b are both automatically pulled from my primary income.

\- The ""Liquid accounts"" under the investment chart is spread between Coinbase, Robinhood, and Acorns; they are all long term holdings.

\- The ""Other"" chart is basic savings between the two of us.

Anyway, that's all I got for this month! I look forward to seeing it progress over the next year.",151,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/1hgmq7s/a_year_of_paying_off_160k_debt/,1734474626.0,Competitive_Cat_5915,1hgmq7s,advice_seeking
povertyfinance,getting started investing,Any suggestions to help me make more money? Chicago,"Hi, I moved to Chicago with my girlfriend 3 years ago and started having more and more financial problems and spending problems. 

I didn’t used to have problems making rent, I did quit jobs frequently but I came from a small college town with lots of quick employment and job hopping was easy. 

Chicago seems to be very hard to get jobs but also keep jobs— apparently despite me thinking I was pretty capable, I cannot get any jobs except food service out here (I have a BA in Linguistics with Events Management and Programming, Project management, etc.) 
And what’s even crazier is, with my 12yrs of food service experience I thought I was good at food service too, but I can’t even seem to keep these jobs. Somehow I always end up in a situation where my hours become reduced less and less and I can’t make rent. I’ve been fired for having two jobs at this one job when they found out, other jobs strongly discourage it so they can schedule me for whenever they want. Anytime I go into an interview they only want to hire me for “open availability”

I am $13,000 in credit card debt not including student loans, I got T-boned in January and my truck is immobilized for now.  My unstable income and “irresponsibility” of getting fired or leaving jobs that barely schedule me has also created an issue in my relationship with my girlfriend at home and she has talked to me about wanting to live separately (possibly breakup). I do not have any money to move out. My missed student loan payment as well as the missed payments on my credit card dropped my credit from 780 to 430. I have no family that is financially well off for support and I’m a first-generation Japanese American so all my family is overseas. 

I’ve applied for EBT/Food stamps for now and hoping I’ll be approved but for the time being I have two huge industrial sized cans of refried beans that I scoop mold off of and eat.

I’d love any suggestions on any side gigs that I can find, a source for such gigs, anything?? Just anything for more money or a better job or anything. I am willing to put in any work necessary but I don’t have money to invest. 
I wouldn’t mind going back to school or doing training for anything but that requires more money and I’ve tried going to school and working and my GPA has gone down way too much (2.28?) that I’ve realized I can’t work and study at the same time if I don’t want to get kicked out.

povertyfinance,getting started investing,"22, $23K in Debt, No Income, Emergency Fund Gone – Need Help Rebuilding From Scratch","Hey everyone—I’m 22 and currently living in LA. I’ve been through a rough few months and I’m trying to turn things around financially and mentally. I’d really appreciate actual advice or strategies—not just “you’re young, you’ll figure it out.” I get that I’m young, but I’m trying to be proactive now.

Backstory:
I grew up in Chicago and worked part-time at T-Mobile while training to become a pilot. I was making around $4.1K/month total (base + commissions) and used that income to pay for flight school. But aviation training got expensive fast (especially cross-country hours), so I put a lot on my credit cards.

Eventually, I racked up ~$15K in credit card debt and also took out an $8K personal loan. I’ve never missed a payment, but my credit score dropped to 590 due to high utilization. I had a $4K emergency fund, but that’s now gone.

In March 2025, I moved to LA to get into solar sales after a friend of my brother’s hyped it up. He ghosted me as soon as I got here, but I still tried to make it work. I got hired by Sunrun in a 100% commission-based D2D role, worked for 6 weeks straight, and made $0. That experience wrecked me mentally and financially, and I realized I don’t want to be in the sales industry anymore.



Where I’m at now:
	•	Living rent-free with my older brother (he’s in tech)
	•	$15K in credit card debt, $8K in personal loan
	•	Credit score: 590, no missed payments
	•	$0 in savings
	•	Currently unemployed, actively applying to banking/teller jobs for stable income
	•	$500 car payment that I don’t have to pay until July 1st
	•	Still spending on charging my car and food, which adds up

My goals:
	•	Pay off my debt and rebuild my credit
	•	Become a pilot (flying is my passion)
	•	Start a dividend investment portfolio
	•	Eventually help grow my dad’s small business in Jamaica


I’m not looking for shortcuts—just a realistic, step-by-step plan to rebuild. If anyone’s been through something like this:
	•	What would you focus on first in my shoes?
	•	How would you budget while unemployed or on low income?
	•	What’s the smartest order to tackle this debt in?

Thank you for reading—I’m committed to doing the work. Just need help making sure I’m going in the right direction. Appreciate any honest advice.

povertyfinance,how much to save,"As a (learning) mechanic living paycheck to paycheck in a world where car parts are becoming insanely expensive (and worse quality,) PLEASE never buy these cars if you want to avoid massive maintenance costs!","For starters, NEVER BUY A EUROPEAN CAR. VWs, Mercs, Audis, BMW, etc. They're fast, comfy, beautiful, and holy shit are they expensive to work on. They're reliable, only as long as you buy the right model either new or in good condition, and keep up with (relatively expensive) regular maintenance. These are seriously the only for people who can either fix cars themselves, or afford to have someone else fix it for them. Doesn't matter if your dream Beamer shows up on marketplace for an affordable price. That car will very quickly drain your bank account. 

Now for the types of used cars that most people scrolling this sub might buy. Ford, Chevy, Jeep, Dodge, Chrysler, etc. They are not good, to put it lightly. Plastic parts, tons of recalls, cheaply built, and tons of corner cutting bullshit. For those who know about cars, seeing a low riding Ford with plastic sway bar links, oil and transmission pans, plastic drain plugs, valve covers, and intakes really made me hate Ford.

So many Chevys that I see roll in leak from every possible seal and gasket while also needing whole front end suspension rebuilds. 

Please, NEVER buy a Range Rover. They're beyond bad. There's a repair shop across the road from where I grew up that has hundreds of rovers all waiting for repairs. We call it the RRG. Range Rover Graveyard. 

Jeeps are trash, sorry. It hurts me to say that, given how iconic they are and their history. But they are throwaway cars now. Recently had a fairly new Jeep Compass come in for a new starter. Less than 40k miles on it. The new starter we put in (OEM, not a cheap part) was also trash. Had to put it in again. Oh and the Compass had already been in several times for other unrelated issues. 

What about Asian cars? Well it all depends on the brand and type. Nissans are reliable, right? Ehhhhh, their transmissions aren't. Nissan makes the worst CVT transmissions in the world. That's a transmission with no gears, just a belt and some pulleys. And pretty much every Nissan on the road has one now. They blow up like every 50-80k miles on average and you're lucky if it lasts that long. Kia and Hyundai are ok, but do your research on which models have major engine problems. 

Your best bet is Toyota, Honda, or Subaru. I'm a bit of a Toyota fan,  so that's what I drive. It has nearly 300k miles in it and the motor is still mint. There are some Toyota engines that are damn near bulletproof. But with Subaru make sure you do not get any model with the 2.5 liter engine. If you do, you HAVE to make sure that it has already had it's head gaskets replaced with upgraded aftermarket parts. This is because for a while Subaru decided to use a different gasket material for that engine, leading to the infamous ""blown head gasket"" that Subarus are now famous for, a something that costs about $2000 on average to fix.

But don't let that scare you from buying a cool used Scooby Doo. They're awesome cars, super reliable, efficient, and apart from one engine option (a problem that can be ignored if the car you're buying already has upgrades gaskets) they're just great cars. Suzuki is also a good option, though I don't know much about them tbh. I do love the Suzuki Jimny though.

I could go on and on, but I'll just boil down it down to this: If the car brand is American or European, run away. If it's Asian, do your research. And NEVER buy from a dealership unless you enjoy getting fucked by predatory payment plans and outrageous interest rates. 

One last bit of parting advice: If you're buying a used car from an individual, get it inspected by a mechanic first. Many shops will do a free walk-in multi-point inspection for any car, including the one I work at. I've done inspections for people thinking of buying cars. We look over everything, mark down anything we see, and tell you what's urgent, and what can wait, and then we get you quotes. We can even show you everything that's wrong in person if you want. And you don't have to make any commitment at all. It's a 100% free, safe, and honest way to make sure you're buying a car that won't need any wallet emptying repairs. And many shops are more than happy to do free inspections because it gives them the chance to recommend repairs to a potential new customer.   

I realize that many people here can't afford a car. I sure as hell couldn't right now lol. Can barely afford to put gas in it.  But for those who are saving up to buy one, I hope you don't buy a used Jeep...

Also fuck GM for what they did to Holden. Australia had some awesome cars. Wish I was around to see the Commodore in it's prime..

Edit: Here's a comment from a mechanic under one of my more recent posts in a mechanic subreddit about the GM ecotech engines...

""Couldn't agree more. I always say when I see the bays packed full of Chrysler, ford, and GM, why the hell do people still buy this crap.

For instance, we have 2 grand caravans next to each other at my work, one needs camshafts, the other needs a flexplate and it also ticks so probably valve train issues as well.

We generally have at least one Ford 3.5 twin turbo needing life support in the shop. We've done multi thousand dollar tickets on various Ford fusion over the past month.

Literally anything with a GM ecotec engine 🤮
Those things are constantly falling apart and running like shit for absolutely no reason. Vacuum pumps grenading. Timing chains shitting out. Hell, even the 3.6 timing chain guides fall to bits within the warranty period.

We had a 2.4 in that will randomly go into limp mode while driving. Found the intake manifold bolts were loose and fatigued, I snapped one torquing it to spec, so that got replaced. New O2 sensors, new variable intake valve solenoid, endless smoke tests, every tech in the shop has looked at this thing for multiple hours, so I don't even know what all has been done to it to try to fix it. It has never run right, always comes back with an air/fuel code.""",3970,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/1krsxgj/as_a_learning_mechanic_living_paycheck_to/,1747816960.0,Slinky_Malingki,1krsxgj,advice_seeking

povertyfinance,how much to save,Multigenerational living has become our only option,"Due to skyrocketing costs of living and dealing with an extremely high amount of expenses over the next six months, my husband and I had a sit down and we realized that we cannot keep living where we are. Our monthly living expenses of just rent and utilities are $3000 CAD. That's not including groceries, pet costs, other mandatory costs, and anything else we might be spending on. 

We looked at our spending and wrote everything from the last few months down in order to see where our money was going. We have some debt we need to pay off as well and it has been hard to start doing more than the minimum payments when our monthly costs are so much. 

I went over to my parents' place today and I had a chat with them about how everything is so expensive and my husband and I are really struggling. They offered us their basement suite, which has its own private entrance and doors that lock from the inside, for $1200/month. This would cover the cost of utilities, property tax, and homeowners insurance. Previously my grandmother had been living there but she passed away in December 2023. They've offered it to us before but we've always said no because our costs were never this high.

My husband and I talked it over once I got home and realized that without any lifestyle adjustments, we would be saving $1800/month which could be thrown aggressively at debt and then once that's gone, it could be set aside and saved. We love my parents and they're very strong on personal boundaries so there's no concern about them coming in and invading our space. It would be our own unit and if we never want to see them, we don't have to. We would also rather pay money to my parents rather than our landlord who has not dealt with any of the issues we have brought forward.

We are looking to move into the basement suite in September and will probably live there for 1-2 years so that we can save as much money as possible.

povertyfinance,how much to save,"If you can’t afford to pay for your child’s college education, read this.","
I’m a high school teacher in the USA, so my advice here is for parents who have children that will be going through school and college in the U.S. 

I want to preface this post by stating that one of the things that I see so often from children who are ready to graduate from high school and go off to college (if that is the path that they take), is that so, so many are unaware of the debt they are taking on and the true impact it can have. They look at the projected median gross income of their aspired career and go from there without understanding how compound interest works on these loans and/or just how much you can NOT shake them off through even bankruptcy. And many, many colleges and universities are so predatory about getting these children into their schools that are astronomical in price with pressure to move out of their parents home and into the dorms ASAP to “get the college experience”, thus adding to the expense of college and the debt they will have chasing them down into and throughout adulthood. The children who are being pulled along, and parents who may not know better or who have never gone to college themselves, are often convinced by the representatives from these universities and colleges that they need to do x,y, and z so they can have the *true* college experience. 

Given that I teach in a Title I school, the predatory nature of these reps is that much more infuriating, because I am seeing seniors taking out private loans with huge interest rates since FAFSA grants and loans  won’t cover all of the costs. And the children do not know better.

This post is made out of the frustration I have from seeing both children and their parents being pressured into taking out large amounts of debt unnecessarily when they could save so, SO much money on college, thus helping their children start out on the right foot while also letting children who may feel they couldn’t have afforded college actually be able to have a more fair shot.

Here’s my advice:
- when your child starts middle school and/or high school (you can do it just at the high school level as well), meet with their counselor and tell them that you want your child to be put into dual enrollment for the last 1.5- 2 years of high school. They will have to meet the eligibility requirements for the program that are set out by the state or district where they attend school, but most of the time these criteria are fair and allow for students who put in reasonable effort in their early high school years to enroll in the program. 

A quick definition of dual enrollment for those who are unfamiliar: “Dual enrollment allows high school students to take college courses and earn credit towards both their high school diploma and a college degree. This program enables students to experience college-level coursework while still in high school, potentially shortening the time to degree completion and saving on tuition costs” 

Essentially how it works is students in their 11th and/or 12th grade years take college classes at a local community college. These classes typically fulfill both high school course requirements AND also college-level course requirements that enable them to work towards an Associates degree. Students are also usually allowed to take classes that go beyond just what is needed for high school once they take those base classes, to the point where I have had students who graduate with their associates via dual enrollment in May of their senior year and then walk for their high school graduation in June, having earned both during their time in high school. 

The important thing to note is that the dual enrollment classes will count towards both the high school GPA and their college GPA, so it is imperative that they take the classes seriously, since their grades will follow them into college / university. 

And while all of what is stated above is great, the real benefits come with the fact that dual enrollment courses are typically free, and many districts also provide the funds for student textbooks as well. If not, please don’t let the textbook costs be what prevents you from putting your child through the program, you can rent textbooks for super cheap via Amazon and also get used books via ThriftBooks. Many schools/ districts will also provide bus passes and alternative transportation for dual enrollment students as well, so definitely talk to the counselors about this if that is an area of concern. 

Now! My second piece of advice is:

- Have your child earn their Associates from a local community college THEN transfer to a 4-year institution (college or university). Their bachelor’s degree will only show the name of the school they finish at, and students who earn their associates at a community college and then transfer pay less for their college classes’ tuition while in community college in comparison to the 4-year-institution’s tuition for their version of the same classes.  

Another reason that this matters so much is because often, a student who goes to a college or university to earn a bachelor’s who already has their associates degree may be able to skip over HAVING to live on campus. Many colleges and universities have it written in that freshman (and sometimes sophomores) have to live on campus. The cost of on-campus housing is astronomical and often also requires (and I mean by the university, not just by circumstance) that students get a meal plan as a part of that as well, thus adding to the expense.  

Thirdly, PLEASE! PLEASE! If it is financially possible, please let your child live with you during their college years while they attend school and encourage them to commute (and to attend a close-by state school) instead of living outside of the house. The vast majority of costs for students going to public universities come from living expenses that could be saved by them staying with their parents. Tuition per year for most is around $7-8k, and FAFSA+ a summer job can likely cover those to prevent the need for kids to take out higher-interest private loans and or from you feeling the need to take out Parent PLUS loans (also a nightmare to pay back).

While parents and students may worry about the “college experience”, so long as your child is actively engaged in the opportunities available at their college or university, they will still have this! They can join clubs, play sports, and get involved with on-campus events. The level of involvement, not where they live, is what makes the college experience.  

And lastly remember this and tell your children this as well:

Where they attend college is an ECONOMIC / FINANCIAL decision NOT a marker of who they are as a person. 

It’s a tool to leverage for education, not a marriage or a personality marker. If two accredited universities offer the same degree with similar opportunities, choose the university that is cheaper/ more accessible. 

If these pieces of advice are combined, then in theory, your child would have the ability to graduate high school with their high school diploma AND their Associates degree (free of charge or very, very close to it), and then would be able to live at home for the two years after while they earn their bachelors as a commuting student needing to pay just tuition and fees, which would be around $8k per year, making them having the ability to get their bachelors at the total cost of $16k as apposed to spending $24k PER YEAR by moving away to college and doing all 4 years at a university. 

This can mean the difference of paying $16k vs ~$100k for the same degree. 

AND if your child qualifies for grants through FAFSA (they are income based), this amount could be further dropped down, and in some cases making a part-time and summer job being enough to cover the costs not covered by grants.  

Some final pieces of advice:
- children can earn college credits if they take and pass AP and IB classes as well, HOWEVER! I don’t recommend these over dual enrollment since not all colleges accept passing AP and IB scores in terms of counting them towards college credit. That, and, if college credit is granted is boiled down to a test taken on one day that may be significantly harder than the actual dual enrollment classes themselves. This means that many students complete their AP and IB courses with a passing grade, but fail the exam at the end of the year and do not get college credit because of this. Dual enrollment is often a better option due to the classes usually being easier and having multiple opportunities to improve if they happen to test poorly on a singular exam. 

- scholarships are great! Have your child start applying for them as early as their sophomore year, but definitely in their junior year. Senior year scholarships are there, but many are geared towards juniors. This also gives more flexibility in terms of where they can attend 

- know that a full tuition scholarship and a full ride scholarship aren’t the same thing. A college paying full tuition that requires a student to move away from home, live on campus, and pay for a meal plan may still be more expensive than paying for only tuition while they live at home. Your child will likely need to volunteer to be eligible for larger scholarships. 

- FAFSA grants and loans can also be applied to trade school!!

- Many schools have programs that kids can be a part of if they want to enter the trades / earn their cosmetology license/ etc. these can be done in combination with Dual Enrollment classes, which can further expand the opportunities that your child has once they graduate.

She's keeping the place and I had to leave. I have no car, no job and now no home. I packed what l could carry and left this morning. 

I'm currently sitting in a library trying to make it back to last place I could call home. I'm leaving behind 3 wonderful kids and wonder if I'll be ok. I'm so lost scared and alone and have no clue what the future will hold. I'll have to stay at a local shelter and use what little money I have have left from saving to buy a bus ticket which doesn't run until the morning. After I get back home I don't know what I'll do. 

I trying so hard to stay sane and not do something stupid. I have no one else to turn to and just feel like telling someone anyone who would listen. If anyone has ever been in a similar situation, I would love to know how you survived and found work because I honestly don't think I can.

Edit for more Context:

hope my other replies helped fill this out but I'll start from where all went downhill. I used to work in furniture sales up until 2022. It was commission based so as long as sales were good I did more than fine. But during covid sales got too hard due to supply chain issues and prices skyrocketing so I was convinced by my uncle to take up trucking. 

I found a carrier that paid for my CDL training and did that for a year. The long times away put a huge strain on our marriage. I quit it in January this year and found a DSD vendor job to be closer to home and salvage our marriage. A few weeks back. Our lease on our old home expired a few months back and the landlord jacked the rent up to where even at my old job we couldn't afford it and we tried to make it work a while. We decided to move and I maxed all my cards over the last 3 years and destroyed my credit and managed to keep hers relatively ok. We found income based apartments that we could afford if I wasn't on the lease so we were like we could make this work.

And then I lost my job due to a variety of reasons, attendance, not having enough pto to take days off but we couldn't really afford to delay as we rented a U-Haul. HR canned me and made the stress even worse. All the stress caused us to start arguments and shouting matches and it boiled over. 

We realized if we keep doing this a neighbor could report her for having me there and not on the lease and it would terminate her lease and then we would all be screwed. I made the decision to leave before it got to that point. I wish it was under better circumstances but we agreed it would be the best for us both. I spending a night a local shelter she dropped me off to and booked a greyhound ticket to go back home. I have family friends and a support system to make it easier to get a job. 

I didn't want to stay in the home and risk her losing hers. I really don't want to paint it as her kicking me out but just 2 people realizing we can't do this. I was seeking employment while we're moving and actually went around the whole town to find anywhere hiring. I had interviews lined up but with everything going on I honestly don't want to stay around here anymore. 

This is the culmination of a series of piss poor decisions on my part and since I was the one that created it, I felt like I should be the one to deal with it.

Edit 2: To everyone that I can't reply to I just want you to know I have family and friends willing to help and an old boss I contacted is going to let me take an entry level job. The pay is shit and it'll be tough to save up but I have a friend's couch to crash on and can hopefully start saving up for a place of my own. My wife and I have agreed as soon as I'm able to get a ride I can visit them and when I get a place we can share custody. I don't know what the future holds and have 1 more night at the shelter cause the next bus back is for tomorrow. And in case anyone didn't catch it I voluntarily left and she took me to the shelter. We are trying to make the best of a marriage that should have ended awhile ago 

Edit 3: to everyone suggesting I should go back to trucking, it is very likely something I will do due to all the excellent points people made.  

To everyone that offered kind words and support thank you I had to check in the shelter before the cutoff. I'm lying on quite possibly the hardest bed I have experienced in my life, including the crappy sleeper I had to sleep on for a year. I'll be fine. I'll find a way to make it work and thank you all for the support even if it's telling me to nut up and do it. I plan to guys I really do.

povertyfinance,how much to save,I've decided I'm not going to save for retirement.,"I know this is basically sacrilege, and frankly kind of stupid. But I've put a considerable amount of thought into this, and it would probably be hard to change my mind. This is how I came to this decision. 

Last week my father passed away, he was only 60 years old. He had no serious health problems, he wasn't in an accident, he wasn't murdered, he didn't take his own life. It was just a random heart attack when he was sitting in his back yard. He never made it to ""retirement age"", and it was completely unpredictable. 

I have no surviving grandparents, all 4 have already passed. None of them made it to even 80. I have no kids, no one to pass anything to. 

So really, what's the point? If there's a good chance you'll never get to enjoy it? And even if you make it that far, you're going to be pretty old, how much fun can you really have when you're 70, and how much of that fun requires a few million dollars of savings? 

Sure, if your company has a 401k match policy not contributing is like literally throwing away ""free money"", plus the compounding gains from the market make it that much more valuable. But again? Who the fuck cares when you're 70? 

That 4-10% I'd be contributing is so much more useful to me now. This is a bill I could be paying to get ahead, or a trip I could take while I'm still young. Why should I think about a future of elderly leisure that may never come, when I can just live now? 

The only counter argument I can see is that I could borrow money from my 401k. But like woohoo, I can borrow my own fucking money, and have to pay back my own money. So I can pay off some terrible unforseen trajaedy. I'm probably fucked if I have to resort to that anyways. 

Idk, I feel like it seems like sacrilege, because we are always told it's the correct and smart thing to do. But I think I'll take my chances and go against the grain. 

Hopefully I don't make it 114. ",645,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/1me8so7/ive_decided_im_not_going_to_save_for_retirement/,1753985118.0,Ragnaroknight,1me8so7,not_advice_seeking

povertyfinance,savings rate,Does Anyone Find It Frustrating That Most People Don't Understand How Expensive Rent Really Is?,"I'm 33. I spent most of my 20s making $7.50 an hour in near poverty. Now I have a good job (Systems Admin) in a good career field with a Master of Science degree. However, I only make $42K a year before tax. 

A lot of people tell me, if you are unhappy where you are living, ""MOVE!"" but I literally can't afford rent anywhere in the country. Not even in the middle of nowhere Iowa or Nebraska or Wyoming. 

Just about everywhere I have looked in the US the cheapest rents are about $1000 a month even before utilities and even checking SpareRoom, Roommates, etc. Most people want a minimum of $1000 to be there roommate or rent a 200 square foot room. People have even given me the suggestion of renting a trailer somewhere. Same thing, every mobile home I have seen starts at around $1000 just for the rent before the lot fees + utilities. 

People tell me to stop looking at NYC or LA or Boston. But I am not. I'm looking at rural and suburban towns in the middle of nowhere. 

Then further more, the rare time a place pops up for $800 or so a month. The landlord wants a minimum income level of around $50K to $60K a year to even be considered. I just can't seem to win.

About 4 years ago, I had a two bad employers that wouldn't pay me and I ended up in a ton of credit card debt. I've spent the last two years paying off all of the debt. Just made my last payment yesterday. 

I'm hoping to save most of my income and maybe find a better job (the market is slow, so it may be awhile). But even then it seems like even people are listing their single wides at $300K that need a lot of work and they are selling! As where true 800 square foot one story homes go for $400K in the middle of nowhere.

I get the fact that people are trying to be helpful. I think most of them are homeowers with combined incomes that have fixed rate mortgages that only cost them $1000 a month.

povertyfinance,savings rate,UHC denied my jaw surgery. How can I get $65k to pay for the surgery out of pocket?,"Hello, I (26y) am planning on having double jaw surgery to help with my severe sleep apnea in February, but United Healthcare has a terrible track record for covering jaw surgery. They've already denied me once, and the surgeon's office says they expect UHC will only pay $4,000 maximum for the surgery that's $95,000. My surgeon is only in-network with Blue Cross Blue Shield PPO, which doesn't seem to be offered as an individual plan in my state (PNW).

I've had two doctors express that I need this surgery, and my life is falling apart. I am severely depressed from lack of sleep, my work performance has suffered greatly, I had to drop out of my master's program, my fiancee left me two months ago because of my depression, so on and so on. I'm going through it. I say this to illustrate that I've been dealing with this for years, and ignoring the problem has caused me great harm. I want this taken care of as soon as possible.

The surgeon offered me a self-pay discount of $65,000. I'm an engineer with a salary of $85k but I already have $130k in student loans. I've moved back in with my mom to save money for the surgery. Aside from my student loan repayments, my expenses are fairly low right now. I have no other debts.

I've already paid half of the bill as a down payment by maxing out my CareCredit ($18k) and taking out a personal bank loan ($15k). I also have $8k on a 0% credit card to my orthodontist, as orthodontics are required after jaw surgery. Unfortunately carrying these loans has dropped my credit score from 830 to 669.

The question is where can I get the other $32,500? I have $22k in my 401(k) that I can cash out, though I'm not sure how much would be lost in the penalty. Should I take out another bank loan? Should I try and find a new job that offers BCBS PPO? Should I expect to file bankruptcy? Any advice? Thank you.

Edit: I do want to mention that I have tried CPAP, Bilevel, and ASV and none of them work very well. I have been using Bilevel for 1.5 years now and it's like a 20% improvement at best, and other times I think it actively makes my sleep worse.

Edit 2: To elaborate, my x-rays show my sleep apnea is a consequence of having an underdeveloped lower jaw that is crowding my airway. I even had sleep apnea when I was down to 12% bodyfat, because my breathing issues are a consequence of my poor bone development and not because of excessive soft tissue. Hence why CPAP does not work.

And to address why I am working with an out-of-network surgeon, it's because there are no orthognathic surgeons in-network with UHC. Most orthognathic surgeons are not in-network with any insurances at all, so the fact that my surgeon even accepts BCBS makes him an outlier.

The thing is that most insurance providers will still cover the surgery out-of-network if it is demonstrated to be necessary, except for UHC. UHC is far and away the worst insurance provider when it comes to denying this surgery, with [denial rates 7x higher than the national average](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7925386/) for orthognathic surgery. Even if I can't get BCBS I might just try and get another insurance just because anything is better than UHC.

I really wasn't expecting to see this many responses to this post, so I want to thank you all for your time and help. <3

Edit 3: I've decided to order a custom oral device (ApnoTX) from my orthodontist to open my airway while I sleep. Hopefully this will give me enough breathing room (literally) to get my finances in order before moving forward with the surgery.

If anyone is looking for a airway-focused orthodontist on the west coast I cannot recommend Dr. Joseph Yousefian enough. He has been so kind and sympathetic and a pleasure to work with. He says he spends a lot of time thinking about my case and it makes me feel very understood.

Edit 1/29: UHC approved my prior authorization! I had to take out 65k in loans and credit card debt to pay the upfront costs, but hopefully the insurance reimbursement will help.

In order to open up a CD account you have to have a certain amount of money to put into that account before you open it and you can’t touch it for four months. I put my foot in my mouth when I asked her if she thinks that banking is set up to benefit wealthy people more so than people who are struggling I immediately regretted asking because of course she said no, and then she said that the bank that I go to is even less like that than other banks, so I would love to hear thoughts on this if you guys have experience with this same sort of situation.

At any rate, I was finally happy that I got it back from the mechanic and it was running great for the whole week I've had it.

povertyfinance,build emergency fund,How to build an emergency fund step by step,"Hello everyone,

let me tell you a personal story first, before we dive into the topic of the title.

When I first started working at the age of 17, I blew every single euro I earned. I was fortunate enough that my basic expenses such as food and shelter were covered by my parents (because I still lived at home) and that made saving money very unnecessary.

Eating out, clothes, skateboards, random shit here and there and by the next paycheck my account was empty.

I had a girlfriend at the time and when summer came she said: “Hey, let’s take a trip to the seaside.” Well, I couldn’t. I literally had no money because I was so reckless. Then I started reading a lot about personal finance and the first thing everybody tells you is to build an “emergency fund”.

But what is it? For me an emergency fund is a certain amount of money you save up in case something bad happens, so you still have enough money to live comfortably for 3-6 months.

When you first start earning money, emergency fund is what you should start building from the beginning. Forget crypto, stocks, gold, clothes, cars, … If you have the option, save 6 months worth of your living expenses first, because the future is very uncertain and you never know what might happen.

When you have an emergency fund, life is a lot less stressful and you become a lot more flexible with the things you do and the risks you take.

Soo, how do you build an emergency fund when you can barely get through the month. I’m no expert but I think with consistency and persistency everything is possible.

I wrote this to help you build your emergency fund and become less stressed. We all know how bad having money problems actually is.

Hope you enjoy.

Life has a way of throwing curveballs when we least expect them. Our car breaks down, a medical bill pops up, or someone starts mentioning “layoffs” at work. These moments can feel overwhelming, especially when money is already tight. That’s where an emergency fund comes in. And it’s not about getting rich, it’s about having a safety net so that life’s surprises don’t knock you off your feet. But let’s be real, the idea of saving money when you’re already stretched thin can feel impossible. It’s not. You don’t have to overhaul your entire life overnight. You just need to take it one step at a time.

Start small. The idea of saving three to six months of expenses can feel like climbing a mountain, but don’t let that number paralyze you. Set your first goal at 500**€** or 1,000**€**. That’s enough to cover a lot of the unexpected expenses that tend to pop up. Car repairs, a trip to the doctor, or an emergency flight. Breaking it down into smaller milestones makes it manageable and gives you something to celebrate along the way.

The next step is finding where the money can come from. This doesn’t mean cutting out everything you enjoy, but it’s about being more intentional with where your money goes. Take a look at your expenses. Are there subscriptions you don’t use? Can you swap a few takeout meals for home cooking? Even small adjustments, like brewing your own coffee or canceling an app you barely use, can add up faster than you think. The key is not to deprive yourself but to align your spending with your priorities.

Set up a separate savings account for your emergency fund. This isn’t your regular bank account, and it’s definitely not the one linked to your debit card. You want it to be accessible in an emergency but not so easy to dip into that you’ll raid it for concert tickets or gadgets. Online savings accounts or even a high-yield savings account work well because they’re slightly removed from your day-to-day spending.

Automate it. Once you’ve figured out what you can save, even if it’s just 20**€** a week, set it up to transfer automatically into your emergency fund. This takes the decision-making out of the equation and ensures that you’re consistently building your fund. You’d be surprised how quickly 20**€** here and there adds up when you don’t have to think about it.

Finally, make peace with the fact that it won’t be perfect. There will be months when things come up and you can’t save as much, or you’ll need to dip into your fund before you hit your goal. That’s okay. That’s what the fund is there for. The important thing is to keep going. Every euro you save is a step toward less stress and more control over your life.

Building an emergency fund isn’t about reaching some arbitrary number. It’s about creating breathing room in your life. It’s about knowing that when something goes wrong, and it will, you have a plan. And there’s power in that. You might not be able to control everything life throws at you, but you can control how prepared you are to handle it. Start small, stay consistent, and know that every step you take is a step toward peace of mind. You’ve got this.

I hope this gives you a better understanding of how important having an emergency fund is and how to save for it.

If you have any other questions on this topic, please ask them in the comments and I’ll be happy to help you.

2. Got current on utilities ($500)


3. Put $1000 in emergency fund as suggested by u/Constant_Thanks_1833 rather than just $600


4. Put remaining $1600 toward credit card debt ($2000 total)


The remaining $400 CC debt I'll pay off next month. And following u/Interesting-Song-782's great advice, I'll be taking what I was paying in CC minimums (~$100/month) and adding that to my emergency fund going forward.

I’ve still got to replace my windscreen for $800 and also need an extra $730 worth of parts replaced. 

All up that’s $4950 that I will have spent on the car, not including fuel of course. 

I love having the car though. I just forgot how expensive it is to have one. 

So I’m now going to SAVE like my life depends on it…. Because my life DOES depend on it. I’m gonna build an emergency fund so that I can sleep peacefully at night and never have to worry.

povertyfinance,build emergency fund,I just filled for bankruptcy and haven't slept better in YEARS!,"Okay, sorry for the long post — just wanted to share my experience with bankruptcy in Canada in case it helps someone.

Quick backstory:
I'm a 33F, university dropout (for mental and physical health reasons), and I had about $78K in unsecured debt — $54K in a student line of credit and $24K in credit cards. Honestly, it’s incredibly embarrassing to be in this position. My debt came from a mix of poor financial decisions in my late teens and early 20s, and I just couldn’t climb out of it.

It felt like I was suffocating. I couldn’t sleep, I was constantly anxious and depressed. I did everything I could — no eating out, no coffee, no shopping, no extras — and still, I wasn’t making a dent. I always made my minimum payments to cover the interest and tried to chip away at the principal, but I was getting nowhere. No emergency fund, living paycheque to paycheque, always terrified of a surprise expense. I was drowning.

One day, in tears (ugly crying), on the edge of a breakdown, I googled “debt solutions in Canada.” I learned about debt consolidation loans (not viable for me for a number of reasons), consumer proposals, and bankruptcy. That’s when I discovered Licensed Insolvency Trustees (LITs) — federally regulated debt professionals. That regulation part gave me some peace of mind since there are so many scammers preying on financially vulnerable people.

I started calling around. Some firms made me feel judged or condescended to. Some were cold or lacked empathy. But eventually, I found someone who got it. He listened, asked non-judgmental questions, and helped me explore my options. He answered probably 30+ emails and countless phone calls. He made me feel supported. It's important to keep in mind that an LIT is a neutral party. They don't work for you, or your creditors. They are like a mediator of sorts - there to make sure no one gets taken advantage of. That being said, they may not work for you, but they are on your side and want to find the best financial solution for you. Just something important to remember. 

We decided to try a consumer proposal first. We submitted a fair offer, and I was hopeful. But literally at 11:45 PM on the final day of the 45-day voting window — a long weekend Sunday — my proposal was denied. I was heartbroken. Completely devastated. It felt like the rug had been pulled out from under me. I thought that was my only shot at getting my life back.

I called my LIT in tears. He calmly reassured me: “This isn’t over. We just need to change direction.” That’s when we started discussing bankruptcy.

Honestly? It wasn’t nearly as scary or devastating as I thought or had previously been led to believe. The stigma around it is so unnecessary. Bankruptcy is designed for honest people in honest debt. Check, yup that's me. 

Here’s how it worked for ME (everyone’s situation is different, and I believe provincially there are quite a few differences as well? I'm unsure on that though):

I own my car outright, and the Blue Book value was around $6,200. You're allowed up to I think $5,000 in vehicle assets. I get to keep my car by paying the $1,200ish in equity in monthly payments during my bankruptcy.

RRSPs: I hadn’t contributed in the past 12 months, so I kept the full amount. Any contributions within the last year are forfeit — fair enough.

Tax returns & government rebates: All of those are forfeit. The LIT files my taxes and is granted access to my CRA account.

Monthly payments: I pay $250/month as a base fee, plus 50% of any income above the federal LICO (Low Income Cut-Off) for a single person, which is currently $2,666/month. There are different amounts of single vs multiple income houses with different numbers of dependants. All that info is also on the government of Canada website. 

For example, if I make $3,000/month:

$3,000 - $2,666 = $334

$334 × 50% = $167

$167 + $250 = $417 total for that month.



This is re-evaluated periodically (I believe at 7 and 16 months?), or if there is a change in circumstance like I lost my job, I got a raise, I came into a big chunk of money, etc. If you consistently make under LICO + $200, you’re only in bankruptcy for 9 months. If you make more, it’s 21 months.

You have to:

Submit monthly expense reports and receipts

Submit pay stubs

Attend two financial counselling sessions (which were actually super helpful)


Your credit report will show an R9 for 6 (?) years after discharge, but you can rebuild your credit before that. I got a secured credit card through a fintech company that reports to BOTH Equifax and TransUnion, and I use it for things like my phone bill and utilities — paid off in full every month. NO EXCEPTIONS!! It's set up for auto payment and I don't even carry the card around with me. This will help build my credit. Keep your utilization under 30% of available credit and ALWAYS pay it off! Never carry a balance!!

I’m only a few months into my 21-month bankruptcy, but I’ve never slept better. My stress and anxiety around money are finally gone. I live on a VERY tight budget with virtually zero ""fun"" money, but that’s okay. I got myself into this situation, and I’m willing to make sacrifices to get out of it, but the key is that I'm actually getting out of it now. I feel so empowered to take back financial control of my life. 

Bankruptcy isn’t the right move for everyone — it doesn’t wipe out things like some government student loans, CRA debt, child support, or secured debts. But for me, it was absolutely the right decision. The trick is finding an LIT you trust. Be honest. Be vulnerable. Don’t hold anything back. It feels horrible in the moment, but it could be the best decision you ever make.

By the end of 2026, I’ll be debt-free and able to start fresh. I couldn’t be more relieved. I may be in a situation to go back to school, or even buy a home! Who knows! There are so many possibilities and I finally have hope for my future again and it feels good. 

IMPORTANT:
I’m not an expert — this is just my experience. Bankruptcy is NOT one-size-fits-all. If you’re considering it, PLEASE talk to a Licensed Insolvency Trustee (LIT). You can find a list on the Government of Canada website. There are tons of great resources there.


TL;DR:
Made bad financial decisions in my early life and ended up with $78K in unsecured debt. Declared bankruptcy, and now my stress is gone, I sleep like a rock, and I’m finally getting my life back. Best decision I have ever made.",122,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/1ljslk3/i_just_filled_for_bankruptcy_and_havent_slept/,1750813868.0,ocean-is-calling,1ljslk3,not_advice_seeking
povertyfinance,build emergency fund,Life just got better!,"So I’ve been staying at a motel next to my job for a few weeks. It was like 480$ a week which while still terrible I could afford it and have enough for food. 

But since the Dallas cowboys started playing and the demand for hotels went up, they wanted to increase my weekly rate to 600$! At a motel with no working washer and dryer.

Understandably I was shitting bricks because that’d put me on the street. But my aunt came in clutch and helped me secure an Airbnb room rental up until I get paid on Thursday. That will be 25$ a night and I’d have everything I need. Feeling blessed because I know not everybody can receive help like that. Shit almost got real.

But now I’ll actually be able to save money for a car and build an emergency fund. Jobs giving a lot of overtime right now and will be taking advantage.

povertyfinance,build emergency fund,Choosing a HYSA. Any other tips for a 21 yr old.,"Hey everyone! I’m a 21-year-old intern making $28/hr this summer til the end of August and starting to take my finances more seriously. Right now, I’m trying to choose a High-Yield Savings Account (HYSA) to park some of my money and earn more than what is earned in my Wells Fargo account.

I’ve got a note ([https://share.note.sx/j802b4bu](https://share.note.sx/j802b4bu)) that lists out a few options I’ve been researching (Ally, SoFi, Marcus, Amex, etc.), but I’m wondering - should I be looking for:

* The *absolute best* HYSA rate/account?
* Or a bank that also offers a checking account I’ll eventually want to switch everything over to once I get a full-time job (hopefully in early 2026)?

I'm also aware that some of these banks offer promotions that I can't necessarily take adavantage of now and don't wanna waste that opportunity to earn more money.

Would it be smart to start transferring all my banking to this new institution now (checking + savings)? Or should I just open the HYSA for now and keep my primary checking elsewhere until life is more settled? Also, which bank would you recommend I go to for an HYSA, considering customer service and APY?

**Other info:**

* I don’t have a ton of expenses right now and I’m able to save a decent portion of my pay.
* Already have a Roth IRA and contribute a bit there too.
* Trying to build a 1-month emergency fund eventually.

Would love to hear how others approached this at my age or in similar situations. Any advice or things you wish you knew at 21 in regards to finances - other things I should start setting up?

povertyfinance,build emergency fund,5 things I wish someone told me at 18,"Im a 21M turning 22 in 2 week and here are the top 5 things I wish I knew at 18 that no one told me

1. ⁠Investing > Saving - investing makes your money work for you savings are for rainy days / purposes only save for a specific reason emergency fund, down payment, etc you don't need to have a lot saved unless it serves a purpose. Investing majority of your money will help you in the long run plus will out preform any HYSA by far especially if your smart if you will invest in dividends that will pay you back each month

⁠2. Budgeting - you need a budget especially one that is calculated for every dollar leaving your account. Spreadsheets are nice and all but don't paint the full picture make your life easier and get yourself an app that does it for you which will actually give you a full view of your money, you can use whatever app you like I personally have been using WalletWize, shows me everything I need to know and gives me alerts when I'm off track in my spending (spreadsheets won't do that)

3. ⁠Live below your means - if your young this isn't the time to upgrade your lifestyle you should leverage your resources, live with parents at home, drive a used car, no fancy restaurants, spend time with friends at home rather than the club / bar

4. ⁠Automate - when money comes into your account 2 things should be automated 1. savings - theses should be automatically transferred to a separate account ideally one separate from your checking bank account so its not easily accessible where you will be temped to transfer into your checking 2. investing - same deal as savings automatically set up to be transferred to your brokerage account so you won't be tempted to spend it

5. ⁠Credit Cards - never and I mean never use a debt card leverage and build your credit as soon as possible find the right cards for your needs ones that give you cash back on purchases, points, rewards, savings on certain merchants, etc most cards give rewards make sure you do your research before applying for one a good one to start with is the capital one quicksilver which gives you 1% cashback for every purchase (there's better but good enough to start with)",38,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/1ljbs53/5_things_i_wish_someone_told_me_at_18/,1750773389.0,Savings-Matter-7574,1ljbs53,not_advice_seeking

I was also recently diagnosed with prediabetes and have been trying to eat healthier which is costing my weekly grocery budget more than before. 

The company  where I work had a meeting this morning regarding how our jobs will be affected by the tariffs that are happening and let me just say it did not sound too reassuring. I am worried for my future as I do not have a nest egg or a big retirement fund in case I end up getting laid off from my job. I do have a 401K through work but it is not enough to live on for more than two months if I end up laid off and without work. 

I do not have parents or friends who would be able to let me stay with them if the bottom falls through. If I lose my job I will literally lose everything. 

I am wanting tips on areas I can cut back on to start saving money and preparing for the worst case scenario as I do not have a strong support system. I am already trying to cut back on electricity usage so my electric bills will not be so high. I am trying to eat a healthy diet but the majority of what I eat consists of salads, rice and beans, and eggs.

povertyfinance,saving for retirement,Finally hit 10k net worth. I know it’s small but it feels massive.,"Just wanted to share this here because I don’t really have anyone in my life who would understand why this feels so big

I’ve been tracking my net worth since late 2022

Back then I was around negative $2,300

Credit card debt

No savings

Living paycheck to paycheck

Spending money I didn’t have just to get through the month

I changed jobs last year and started pulling in a little more

Not a crazy salary

But enough to stop relying on the credit card and start chipping away at the debt

I also set aside $10 a month for gambling on Stake

Literally just $10

Scratched the itch without wrecking my budget (don't follow me kids)

A couple months ago I hit a lucky parlay and turned that ten into over two grand

Threw every cent of it at debt and savings

As of this week

My net worth just crossed $10,000

No more credit card balance

Small emergency fund

A few hundred in retirement

It still doesn’t feel real

povertyfinance,saving for retirement,Does anyone just work one job anymore?,"I am in my early 40s. I have more than one degree with very little student loan debt left. I'm smart with my money and try to save what I can. I do have some health problems- Crohn's.

Haven't taken a vacation in years. My salary is not the best- 40K, and in this economy, rent or buying a house is insane. I live in a travel trailer on land that I purchased years ago before the pandemic - and still pay taxes in rural Texas. Cost of groceries is another huge expense, gas prices and utilities. I  am single, work three jobs- I'm an admissions counselor at a local university, I teach ESL nights and weekends, and I'm a freelance business language consultant because I speak seven languages. How is it possible to only work one job making less than $100,000 a year and not having a family ? Anyone in the same situation?

Edit: Thank you all for your responses! I seem to be in the same boat as many. For a little more context, I have severe Crohn's disease that requires biological drug treatments a few times a month, colostomy bag supplies because I no longer have a colon, and a specific diet (low fiber, high lean protein like eggs, no raw vegetables,  etc.) tends to be rather expensive. 

Cost of insurance is very expensive even if your employer is paying a large portion. I work in academia and I have a pension so that's why I stay. I have been there for over 10 years. I grew up poor, my mother is from Mexico and will probably move back when I retire simply for cost of living- or to a different country like Vietnam. I grew up speaking three languages and learned others in college. My degree was in Data Science and Data Analytics. During college for my masters, I was a software engineer and software developer. Not sure why but the two companies I worked for really did not promote women. So I switched to working for a University because the benefits are good but not the pay.

I have a dog and I prefer not to have roommates.

povertyfinance,saving for retirement,How I got out of poverty,"1. From the age of 18 till about 21, I worked two full-time jobs with no days off except holidays the entire time. Used one to live off and the other to pad my 401k, savings, and simple investments like CDs and treasury bonds.
2. From 22 until about 38, I still worked two full-time jobs, and by this time, I had gotten enough raises and seniority to be able to align my jobs so that I had two half days off and one whole day off a week. After reading books on investing, I added low-cost index funds to my investment portfolio. By this time, I had bought my first home/investment property.

A lot of downsides, however. I cannot stress this enough, I would not get into serious relationships because I was scared of losing someone that I loved, because I could not spend enough time with them. I think I missed so many opportunities to have a meaningful relationship because I was always working. A lot of friends with benefits type of flings.  Friendships that I valued when I was younger faded because everyone got married and we went on different trajectories, but I just didn't have that support system they did with loving parents who cared for me; I was on my own.

I also made some mistakes that set me back along the way. Like when I went in to buy a little truck and I ended up getting talked into a Mustang Cobra that someone t boned a couple of months later, that drained money in my savings that I had worked very hard for. Or that one time a very hot girl asked me to come with my friends to Vegas, and I spent all of my emergency money on a 3-day weekend fling, a very fun fling, but so not worth it. Suite at Caesar's Palace, gambling, eating fancy restaurants, and nightclubs, in one weekend, what took me so long to save. Ouch.

Now at 51, happily married and retiring soon I look back and although it sucked, I did what I had to do to get to where I am now.

Some referrals are links so I took them off not to break any rules. Hope it helps (please don’t feel pressured to do any of these if you don’t want to though) 

Money Making apps 
Side Hustles for extra dough
This is a list of Money Making apps for people looking to make a little extra income passively. (referral codes included) In January of this year (2024) I started researching money making apps that actually work. I did find some that were not worth the time or just weren't right for me. I made sure to give them at least 6 months for each of them before I decided to keep it or delete it. Some I've only had For less than 6 month but are quite good So I'll put them on here and give my reasoning. ( Will also list my Cash out in total or on average)


Receipt Scanning/ E-reciepts / Cashback Apps - Favorites Last to First

Rakuten - 8/27/24 () $ 10.80 This one is a cash back app alot like Honey (which gives you cashback and finds you Coupons and promo codes) I just got it last month and got 12% back For a $100 Oil change. The cash out is every 3 months and they just drop the full amount it in your account on 2/15, 5/15, 8/15, 11/15.

Honey - This app I've had since 2015. Originally It was just on my PC but I use it to find promo codes for everything. It also has cash back for quite a few places. I couldn't tell you how much I've made honestly Since January of this year I've made $14.86 Cashback and countless promo codes lol

Frisbee - 1/13/24 $28.70 I do like receipt scanning apps some are a little slow to pay out, most of them give you more payouts the longer you use. This ones the slowest but still simple with no ads and the cashout works.

Ibotta - 6/14/24 $6.35 ( pqcbrsy ) This one is a cashback app. Look up the item on the app, select the cashback for the items available. Then just scan your receipts Or sometimes the item. I had this one in my extreme couponing era. It's pretty good.

Receipt Hog - 1/12/24 $17.75 ( gak28203 ) Its acute app Easy to use  It's not the biggest payout but if Im snapping pics For other receipt apps might as well for this legit one too well worth it. The payouts work

Receipt Jar - 1/12/24 $27.50( HOPEPJ128 )This one gives you more the longer you're a member but for a lot of the Ereceipts you need to refresh the Connection once a week or so. Just do it when you snap pics of your paper receipts though and it downloads them with the correct points.

Coinout - 6/14/24 $ 10.88 Very Quick money took me less than a month to reach their ""Diamond level” which just means a higher payout for each receipt and bigger rewards. I haven't had it as long as the others but it's up there in my Favorites. It's also got as low as $3 payouts

NCP - 8/30/24 $ 12.50 I had applied to be on this one at sometime this year and got on a waitlist. I heard about the National Consumer Panel in my couponing days but never applied. I do like this one. It's not scanning receipts though. It's scanning barcodes and entering amounts. I will say it does take a little longer for Big shopping trip but it's kinda fun to me. So to each their own

Fetch - 4/13/24 $58.50 ( TP41AA ) Wow love this app. Just try it for real. They give big bonuses for a lot of stuff! Fun interface. This one I wish I had found sooner! Love this App 5 stars. They even added some more cash back and rebates for delivery items. Use my promo Code for a fat welcome bonus too! So so good ❤️ 👍




Data Tracking Apps - Favorites Last to First

Bridge Money - 6/28/24 () $ 6.50 This one It just tracks my spending and gives me cash back for Online receipts. Just claim your cashback then cashout later. I will say when originally researching this one people mentioned it being a little difficult to Cash Out whenever they wanted. I guess there is a time of day when you can… but I have only had it for 2 months so I'll update you when I do cash out for the first time

Caden - 6/16/24 ( 7CC1A7 ) $ 54.12 Like Wow. This one you just connect your netflix account, airbn b ,and some other accounts set it and forget it. And it quietly makes you extra cash in the background. There's a $40 cash out because any less they'd have to charge you. but it took me less than a month and half to make that. I Love this app I recommend It as my Second Favorite 😍 

MSR - 1/12/24 ( 2n1zwCPP ) $ 136.75 This is my Favorite App by far. Not only has the payout gotten larger since downloading it. But I Cashout $ 10 every 2 weeks from this one. There's 2 minute tutorial videos for Each request if you can't figure out how to request your data for things like netflix and Snapchat. But After doing it once or twice it's easy to remember


Walking / Health Apps - Favorites Last to First

Sweatcoin - 6/14/24 It is a good app for health nuts . BUT there isn't a way to cash out or earn actual US Currency. It's all crypto and you have to download two apps. ‘Sweatcoin’ and ‘Sweatcoin wallet’ to earn crypto. I didn't realize this until last month lol. I was using points for sweepstakes and waiting to see if I won anything. I wish I could accurately say how much I earned but I genuinely have no clue what my total would be hadI connected it to ‘Sweatcoin wallet‘ in the first place. There are in app deals for health related products so it is my Honorable mention.

Weward - 6/14/24 ( HxPE-Ktvu* ) $ 3.20 Most of all my walking apps I've only had them for about two months but this is one I'm keeping (I deleted so many walking apps because the Ads and them being Big ole scams like Freakin PaidToGo). I just connect my Apple Health on the app and just convert my steps before midnight. It's slow money but a good app.

Macadam - 6/14/24 ( YE2YPC ) $ 4.38 This app is so cute It has the highest amount of steps that can be converted (almost all Step for cash apps have a cap limit like Paidtogo’s is 12500 steps per day and macadams 20,000 ) I genuinely like the interface and just convert your steps before midnight. They also have no hidden ads

Evidation - 6/14/24 () $ 4.57 This also tracks your steps but you just check it once a day Tell them your mood, how good of sleep you got, and your stress level. Easy peasy.

povertyfinance,50/30/20 rule,I need advice to move out at 18.,"Hi, I'm 17 turning 18 in October. 
I want to move out because I really don't want to stay with my parents anymore. I have a pizza job that pays $11 hourly. Earning about $300 to $400 because of wonky hours. I've been learning about budgeting (50/30/20 rule) and credit cards. My parents originally offered to keep me here paying rent as I get a job at Tesla to learn about electrical Engineering. Lately an opportunity showed up of DoD SMART program offering to pay for education as long as I work for them. I think I have to easier than others, just need to actually plan. I'm trying to get everything figured out. I hate I did this late.

povertyfinance,50/30/20 rule,Don't avoid getting prescription glasses you need because you can't afford them! Giant post (sorry) about how I've managed to Still Mostly See Things While Very Poor (US Based),"Hi! I'm disabled and forever broke due to that (as in, haven't worked in almost a decade, and on benefits from my government that don't even cover enough for my rent). I also can't see more than vague shaped blurs without glasses, so I can't function without them. Unfortunately, they are massively expensive.

Here are my tips for being able to See Things While Poor in the US (and maybe other places, but I have no experience outside of this place):

🔵 if you have literally any choice in the matter, **DO NOT try to order glasses with an outdated prescription**. It seems like you'll be saving money, but it can actually make your eyesight worse, cause things like migraines, and ultimately end up costing you more money in the medium and long term. I'm disabled, and have tried to do this--trust me, if you have the option, get an updated prescription.

🔵 paying for an eye exam to get an accurate prescription is super expensive--most of us don't have vision coverage, and if we do, the copays are gonna be through the roof regardless. 

➡️  Here's what I've found helpful for **paying** for eye exams:

📌 you can get ""annual vision insurance"" for about $15 for your first monthly payment, then cancel after the first month. I was told this one *directly* from my eye doctor's office last week--they recommended VSP (bc they work with them directly), which  covers an eye exam for the around $15 monthly premium. Normally eye exams are like at least $60, if you're lucky. You can find the link to this page here: [https://www.vspdirect.com/compare-plans](https://www.vspdirect.com/compare-plans) 

📌 other options that are more pricey but have worked for me in the past include using America's Best's Eyecare Club Membership--it's $129 for a 3 year ""plan"" that allows you to get ""free"" eye exams anytime in the next THREE years. They've got a bunch of locations all over, and can be used at any of them. If you HAVE $129 to throw at something like this, it's probably worth it. Find the link for that one here: [https://www.americasbest.com/save-money/eyecare-club](https://www.americasbest.com/save-money/eyecare-club)

➡️ Most of the time at an exam, they will want to dilate your eyes so they can check the health of them, and if you can pay for that Y*OU SHOULD DO THAT*. It is usually an extra charge (sometimes around $30?) on top of the standard exam fee, even with either of the above options. It isn’t technically needed for getting an updated prescription though, so you don’t HAVE to if you can’t afford that, but **tell them you’re not doing it at the beginning of the appointment**. If they push for it, tell them you drove yourself here and don’t have anyone who can drive you safely home afterward. 

➡️ When they get to the end of your appointment, **TELL THEM you want a paper copy of your prescription** and that you’ll “come back” to look at glasses. **ALSO ask them to measure your PD (pupillary distance** — the distance between your pupils is something  most places will use to make your glasses, but they don’t always write it on your prescription itself).

➡️  **Take a picture of your prescription and put it somewhere digitally. Even just sending it to yourself as an attachment in an email will work.** I personally have a folder specifically in my photo albums on my phone and separately on my google drive that houses these types of things. 

🔵 **Do NOT try to buy your glasses in person**. They will ALWAYS be more expensive, and no matter what price you think it will be, it will always be at least $100 more than that. If you can pay for the convenience of knowing when and where your glasses will be once they’re made, you should do that. They will be able to make adjustments for you if something is wrong, and having an in person location is always easier to deal with. When you buy online, you’re gambling on the chance that your glasses might be completely wrong, and you won’t really have any way to fix that. 

➡️ Here are places I have personally bought glasses online, and a little bit of my experience with each of them:

📌 [EyeBuyDirect](https://www.eyebuydirect.com) \- more pricey than I’m usually able to do, but the highest quality/most accurate prescriptions on the lenses I’ve found. Sometimes they have sales, but if you have a high index prescription (if your glasses have to be really strong for you to see), plan on paying upwards of $150 for your frames, lenses, and shipping. Worth it if you can afford it, but damn. If you have a glasses related emergency, you can pay extra to get them shipped to you in like 2 days. 

📌 [Zenni Optical](https://www.zennioptical.com/) \- a ton of options for frame styles, very cheap prices, generally decent quality. I’ve never regretted going with Zenni when they had something I liked, but I often couldn’t find anything that fit my gigantically wide face. If you can find frames you like there, this is the place to go. 

📌 [Wherelight](https://www.wherelight.com) \- this website looks like it’s a scam, but I’ve bought at least 4 pairs of glasses from them at VERY low prices and gotten consistently decent quality frames/lenses. Their options are a lot quirkier—not a ton of stock for folks who are trying to blend in at their office job, but a LOT for those with a “children’s librarian” or “quirky barista” kinda vibe. Be prepared for the shipping to take literally a month, sometimes longer. 

📌 [Lensmart](https://www.lensmartonline.com) \- very similar inventory and prices and shipping times to Wherelight, but honestly? Much worse quality in terms of the prescription. My eye doctor literally went “so your prescription in these glasses is way higher than the last prescription I gave you. Was that on purpose?” Nope, I sent in a literal copy of the prescription, and they just made them wrong. It’s happened to me twice in a row, so I’m not planning on using them again if I can help it.

📌 [Firmoo](https://www.firmoo.com) \- my personal favorite in terms of quality of the frames, accuracy of the prescription, and most accessible price point. They’re also CONSTANTLY having sales, so you can get higher index lenses for cheaper than you would other places. They have a promo they’ve done forever where you can get frames and their base lenses for $4.95 + shipping (usually around $8), and they don’t check if you’ve made a new account to get the promo. The frames have to be from a specific page, and if you have a high prescription, you DO have to pay the difference in the lens upgrades. Still super decent in terms of getting glasses, though!

➡️ ➡️  I am writing this after doing a ton of digging on how to get new glasses with my updated prescription, and I was able to find a ton of codes specifically to use at Firmoo as of yesterday (June 4, 2025). Pasting them below in case it helps anybody who sees this:

S4G0G9/GPW50/FIRSTPAIR50- (50% off frames)

30FRAME (30% off frame)

U1H1L4/TRYC50/XPVV50/OPTIC50 - (free standard shipping + $13 off frame) (usually an influencer referral code from what I’ve seen--you can likely find more of these by searching something like ""firmoo promo code"")

20LENS - (20% off lenses)

PRO40/40PG/X40LENS/new40lens - (40% off lenses) 

BOGO25 - (BOGO frames + 25% off lenses)

BOGO - (same as above, no lenses deal)

GIFTFIRMOO - (40% off frames AND lenses)

GIFT2025 - (30% off frames AND lenses)

For me, the best code was by far the GIFTFIRMOO. Might be different for you though, hope it helps!

🔵 **You DO NOT NEED all the lens upgrades**. I know they make it seem like you do, but 99% of the time, you don’t. 

Here’s what I would say is worth spending the money on:

📌 Higher index lenses — if your prescription is higher, you should get the highest index lenses you can afford. High prescription + lower index lenses = coke bottle glasses. I’ve had an eye doctor explain that your prescription isn’t going to be accurate in your peripheral on the thicker, bigger lenses, and you’re actually making your eyesight worse by trying to save money.

📌 Anti-glare/reflective coating - GET THIS ONE if you have an astigmatism (it should be listed on your paper prescription, but if not, you can ask them directly). I thought it was just kind of annoying to not have, but multiple eye doctors have told me that with an astigmatism, if you don’t get this one you’re actively seeing less clearly AND making your vision worse on top of it. It’s usually like a $5 addition, and it’s worth it if you can swing it.

That’s it. You PROBABLY don’t need the anti-blue light option or the hydrophobic/oil repellant stuff to make it through your day. If they ask if you want “driving” lenses, that probably means nothing. (Unless it does, and I’m missing a giant amount of info—I’d love to be informed better on this!)

Okay, that's my giant post. Hopefully it helps somebody, even if it might seem ridiculous that I typed all of this out. You deserve to be able to see as clearly as your eyes will allow, and we all deserve to live in a world where the people around us can see what's happening in front of them when they're doing things like driving a car or preparing a meal. 


‼️Edit: Updating this! ‼️

Adding things from the comments that I missed and were provided by other folks and/or I forgot to add originally, bc i want to make sure you see if you stumble on this post:

🔵 if you have no funds for glasses at all, there is an org that says they will provide you a pair for free if you apply online. I don’t believe you get much choice over things like frames, but you should be able to at least get something. Never used it myself, so I can’t confirm anything on this—but check it out if that’s the spot you’re in, it’s worth you being able to see.

📍Link to the org here: [https://new-eyes.org](https://new-eyes.org)

🔵 before you order online, consider if you have any info on the sizing of the frames you might need. 

If you currently have glasses that fit okay, there’s a good chance some of their sizing info is located on the inside of one of the arms—it should look something like this: [link to example image for glasses measurements](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1893/8015/files/black-frame-measurement-on-arm-guild.jpg?v=1583443176)


➡️ The numbers are listed in millimeters (mm) and mean this:

First number: Lens width

 ▪️measures how wide from one side of your frame to the nose piece would be. 

Second number: Bridge width

▪️ usually the part holding the two lens areas together, often right above the nose piece. 

Third number: Arm length 

▪️ refers to how long the part of the glasses that connects from the front (where your eyes go) to the back (where they sit on your ears). 

➡️ Having these numbers is SUPREMELY helpful in picking your new frames. 

If you don’t have them, or if they aren’t listed on your glasses, going to a place they sell glasses and **trying on a bunch** until you find ones that fit well for you can help you find the right numbers to match online. If you’re there for an eye exam anyway, this is a great time to make this happen!

If that’s not an option, asking a friend to let you try on their frames to test the fit and checking for the numbers from there is better than nothing. 

Most online stores let you sort by specific frame size, and it’ll save you a lot of time if you can do that. 

➡️ Also important! Most glasses by default seem to be made for people with predominantly European ancestry. **If you have any facial features that don’t fit into that, check for glasses labeled with things like “universal fit”. ** This can help you avoid having your glasses constantly slide off your face or fit too snugly on your nose to be comfortable. 

If you can’t find any with this label (they are sometimes more expensive, which is an entirely different rant I have that I’ll save for another day), **I’d recommend making sure to get glasses with nose pads**—that means they will be more flexible to your actual nose shape, not try to bend your nose around whatever they do by default. 

I fit pretty firmly in the “default” demographic for glasses, but unfortunately due to Some Stuff, my nose has been broken a number of times—most standard frames don’t fit me. I HAVE to get ones with nose pads, or my glasses will literally slide off my face. (Why? Idk. I’m not the nose boss.)

🔵 finally: you’ll find a lot more options if you ditch the idea of glasses having a specific gender. Most of the glasses listed under Women’s or Men’s sections are cross listed in both, but some aren’t. A general rule of thumb if how the glasses look gender wise is important to you is this:

Masculine frame styles usually have a straighter top edge and aren’t often in as many colors/patterns.

Feminine frame styes usually are rounder (less sharp edges), and might have more ornamental elements (interesting etching on the bridge/arms, detailing on the frames, etc). 

Does this matter a ton? Not in my experience, though admittedly I am very much not bound by traditional gender roles in my own life. If you find a good frame that works for you, I’d get it. I guarantee you that 90% of frames aren’t going to scream any particular gender unless you specifically pair them with other fashion choices/elements of your gender expression to do so.

povertyfinance,50/30/20 rule,Help me make a budget after moving where 20% of my take home pay goes to paying off credit card debt.,"I have $21,000 in credit card debt. I recently got a job making more than I’ve ever made ($72,000 a year plus a $3000 bonus paid out every February.) I finally feel like I’m in a position to tackle this debt. My credit is terrible as you can imagine.

I’m planning to move to NYC from LA to be closer to family (this is a non negotiable so please don’t talk me out of it.) I have a partner so we don’t need roommates. I sold my car and now have $10,000 in savings. As much as I’d like to put 100% of it into the credit card debt, I will need some of it for the move. I can probably get about $1000 worth of my security deposit back (damages + splitting with partner.) I can probably save around $1000 before moving in October or November. So let’s say $12,000 in savings. 

Let’s say, being conservative, I put $4000 from savings into credit card and drain the rest of it on the move. $17,000 in debt. 20% of my net pay (according to 50-30-20 rule) would be $840 a month. Assuming I put all of that into credit card, how much should I budget for rent, groceries, etc? I was assuming paying $1200-$1700 a month for rent, is that doable? (I work from home so no commute other than personal.) I know it’s New York and it’s very expensive, but I’m excited to not have to deal with car/gas/commuting expenses (and more opportunities for my career, so I can always get an even higher paying job in a year or 2.)

povertyfinance,50/30/20 rule,One step till depression and something bad,"Let's begin.
I'm a relatively young guy, 29 years old (as of 2025).
In May 2022, after all the COVID restrictions were lifted, with no savings and just 200 euros in my account — barely enough for tickets and a bit of food — I decided to move from Latvia to Finland.

One of the main reasons was my job in Latvian restaurants. I worked 350–400 hours a month, with 17-hour shifts on Fridays and Saturdays (plus time to get home), and 13-hour shifts on the other days. My salary? Just €4.50 an hour before taxes (33% tax rate). And food prices turned out to be about the same as in Finland.

One of my acquaintances working in a restaurant chain in Norway told me they were expanding to Sweden and Finland, and needed experienced kitchen staff — especially pizza chefs. I'm a professional chef with over 10 years of experience, mainly with pizza.

In the last week of April 2022, I came to Finland with my girlfriend for a week — a ""vacation,"" but also for a job interview. I wanted to show them what I could do, and see what they were like.
The job interview went well, no issues — I was a good fit, and the company seemed great too.
My girlfriend liked the country. So we decided — let’s move.

But that’s when the difficulties began.
I had no money, so I made a desperate move: I took out my first-ever loan — €1,500 from a Latvian bank for 24 months (already paid off, by the way).
I moved first. On May 3rd, I flew to Finland to sign the contract and get my official documents based on employment. I was granted permanent residence immediately. Then I flew back to Riga to pack and prepare for the move.

On May 19th, I flew back to Finland — alone — with literally 10 euros in my pocket. No place to live, nothing secured. Just the job.
I was ready to sleep outside or in the staff locker room at work.
Then — I got lucky (in a weird way). The food quality chef, the guy who hired me, was incredibly kind and helpful. Sadly, he ended up in the hospital due to illness complications, but he contacted me, found out about my situation, and told me I could stay in his company-paid apartment for a while, since it was empty.

So I did. That’s how the first two weeks passed.
On June 1st, I flew to Riga, packed up my father’s car (mine was broken, and his was bigger), brought my girlfriend and our dog — and we moved.

We rented a long-term room in a hotel (something I later regretted), but at that time, it was our only option. I had no Finnish bank account, and rental companies required one for verification.

Two weeks went by. Pay day.
And... I received half of what I expected.
Panic. Shock. We had just moved in, rent was due, and I simply didn’t have enough money.

In desperation — instead of talking to the landlord, asking my parents for help, reaching out to social services, or learning the rules (turns out I had 19 days after the due date to pay rent without consequences) — I took out another loan.
This time from a non-bank company (still not sure what to call them), with a crazy interest rate of 62% per year.
I don’t remember the exact amount, maybe €3,000.

A week later, at work, I found out there had been a mistake with my salary and I’d be reimbursed the missing part with the next paycheck.
And that’s what happened. My next salary was 1.5x the normal amount.

But instead of using most of that money to pay off the loans, I paid the rent and used the rest for daily living — food, small items for the new apartment, a little fun (though not much — rent took a huge chunk).

Life went on.
A couple months passed.
Rent was €1,250/month. Two loans — €75 and €200 payments.
Salary: about €2,100/month.
Sounds manageable? Not really. Food was expensive, and my car still needed repairs.

Then, around August/September, I brought my 16-year-old sister to Finland.
Our parents agreed — better to study and live in Finland than struggle in Latvia.

But again — a mistake.
We hadn’t properly researched the education system.
We only figured things out 8 months later.
Better late than never, I guess. (She’s now studying to become a nurse assistant — yes, that’s a real job in Finland.)
Anyway — back to the story.

Around September, the total of rent and loan payments reached nearly €1,500/month.
Salary was still about €2,100.
Then came some unexpected expenses — and I took another loan.
This time: €5,000.

And shortly after — another one, €4,000.
From the worst loan company in Finland, the kind thousands of people sue.

I honestly don’t remember the exact order of events, but eventually, my monthly payments hit €1,900 — while I earned just €2,100.
We were three people and a dog. The dog’s food alone cost €90/month.
Food for us? Let’s not even talk about it.
My girlfriend worked as a self-employed nail technician, making no more than €200/month.
And I never asked her to support us financially.

By August 2023, I couldn’t take it anymore.
I decided to tell my parents.
We’ve always had a good relationship, but this was hard to admit.
I finally told my mom.
We’d always avoided loans as a family — and here I was, drowning in them.

We agreed: I’d take out one big loan to cover all the smaller ones, reduce the interest rate, and have just one creditor to deal with.
The loan: €16,000.
Even that wasn’t enough — I still had the Finnish loan and another Latvian one for €2,000.
So the total: €22,000 in debt, plus bills.

You’d think that would be the end.
But no.
My monthly payments were still so high that I didn’t have enough salary to cover them.
On top of that — relationship problems and stress at work.
My boss didn’t respect me or my effort.
To him, it was better to smile while doing bad work than to cook perfectly with a straight face.

Then came the breaking point — January 2024.
One evening, I took out the trash and slipped on the way back.
Fell on my left wrist — it took my full 77kg body weight.
It didn’t hurt much, but I couldn’t rotate dough or lift anything heavier than 3kg without feeling something was ""off"" inside.

Went to the doctor — got sick leave and was put on a waitlist for further exams.
After 3 months of sick leave, I was called in by the restaurant manager — they accused me of stealing.
In December 2023, 18kg of beef had gone missing near the cold room — a place accessible to workers from four other restaurants and nearby shops.
Later, a friend from Norway (a head chef) told me: when companies want to fire someone they don’t like, but who hasn’t done anything wrong — they start pressure tactics like this, hoping you quit on your own.

And that’s where I’m at.

That's how it happened—I decided to quit.

At the end of March 2024, I was overwhelmed with loans, bills, and debts. 

I drove to Latvia to visit family and fix my car, which had clutch issues.  I managed to reach Latvia, but after some time, the flywheel completely failed.  Fortunately, we were visiting my girlfriend's relatives at the time, and they towed me home. 

At that point, I had €16,000 in loans under my mother's name, about €15,000 in small loans under my name, and the car repair would cost around €2,500.  Additionally, I still had to pay rent in Finland (€1,279/month). 

Feeling hopeless, I turned to my best friend and asked if he could become a guarantor for my loans.  He agreed, and we secured €15,000. 

I paid for the car repairs and closed almost all the loans, thinking life was improving. 

How wrong I was. 

I was unemployed, receiving unemployment benefits from the union.  At the time, I didn't know that unemployment benefits were initially taxed at 25%, which could have been reduced to 4% (I only found this out in 2025).  As a result, I received €1,400 per month, from which €1,279 went to rent, and I had three loans: €320 and €300 (the ones under my friend and mother) and another €120 loan in Finland. 

Obviously, the money wasn't enough.  I asked my family for help—they did assist—but I couldn't keep asking them.  Like an idiot, I took out more loans, again from the same companies where I'd already closed previous ones. 

Skipping ahead, by September 2024, my girlfriend was no longer my girlfriend.  She still lived with me but started dating a jerk we initially considered a friend. 

I had a total of €60,000 in loans, still no job, and was in a complete mess. 

In August, after undergoing an MRI for my hand, the doctor said there was a slight change in the wrist, but it shouldn't cause discomfort (it does, man, you have no idea how much). 

In October 2024, through acquaintances, I found a job as a demolition worker on a construction site (for those unfamiliar, this involves carefully demolishing the interior of buildings undergoing reconstruction to minimize costs).  I started working; the salary wasn't bad—paid every two weeks.  Considering I started at the end of the year and Finland has a progressive tax system based on annual income, I received €1,100–€1,200 every two weeks.  Gradually, I began to think things were getting better, not considering that my girlfriend was slowly moving in with that jerk by December. 

Simultaneously, I got involved in some unofficial work, where I was promised €1,000 per month just for renting out a warehouse.  At that time, needing money, I agreed.  This turned out to be another huge mistake.  It turned out they were storing illegal cigarettes there, and the police got involved.  Now, in May, I have a court hearing, and I'm partially held responsible.  Even though I have a good lawyer, the outcome is still unknown (the verdict is on June 6). 

December 31, 2024—New Year's Eve and my birthday.  I sat alone with my dog in the apartment (my sister went to our parents for the holidays), my ex was with that jerk.  I made myself a ""cake"" from white bread and strawberry jam and, with a head full of problems, wished myself a happy birthday and New Year. 

In January 2025—I don't remember exactly when, maybe February—that jerk turned out to be not just a jerk but a complete idiot.  He treated her terribly, and she came back to me, apologized, and all that.  Of course, I forgave her.  I'm the kind of person who told myself I'd have only one girlfriend, one and forever.  She was my first, and considering our relationship is still in bad shape, if she leaves, I'll just take my car and go live somewhere in the Lapland forest after paying off all the loans. 

In February 2025, we moved from our previous residence to a slightly cheaper place, 30 square meters larger, and almost €300 less expensive (€1,050 per month). 

But not everything went smoothly.  The previous landlord billed us €1,400, claiming the dog damaged the furniture.  The only issue was dog hair.  Even though we paid an extra €30 per month for the dog, and they knew dogs shed, a professional cleaning company could remove the hair in 20 minutes.  But they didn't care. 

On February 17, my boss went on a two-week vacation without telling me where to report on Monday.  He ignored me.  After two weeks, he called and scolded me, saying I should have worked better and not stayed home.  They supposedly sent me a warning two weeks before February 17 that there would be no work for a while (but I never received anything).  On March 2, 2025, I received a backdated letter (in Finland, there's such a warning about potential lack of work, which allows you to register as unemployed).  Because of this, I registered as unemployed later, and while my situation was being reviewed, I lost time and money.  The employer clearly violated the rules but managed to avoid responsibility. 

Here's the approximate summary: 

May 2025

Approximately €50,000 in loans 

One unpaid loan transferred to collectors for €4,000 

A €1,500 fine from the previous landlord, also with collectors 

Debt to the current landlord for 3.5 months of rent, totaling €4,000 with interest 

Living with my sister (a student, currently not working) and my girlfriend/ex-girlfriend (works as a nail technician, earning €100–€600 per month) 

I found unofficial work delivering flowers for a company that has been operating in Estonia for over 7 years and is number one there.  They moved to Finland in April and are just entering the market.  The promotion is progressing quickly, but I still earn between €0 and €120 per day, averaging €350 per week. 


Stress has caused numerous health problems: my teeth are crumbling, I have gray hair (which I've always dreamed of), and constant sleep deprivation due to panic attacks, even in my sleep. 

I'm losing hope but understand that giving up isn't an option. 

I've never asked for help, but now I'm in a situation where I don't know what to do. 

I feel like I should find MrBeast and participate in one of his challenges—survive in the forest for three months without food for $100,000—just to pay off all the debts and start life anew.  But MrBeast doesn't live in Finland, and I can't find him here. 

I'm not asking for non-refundable financial assistance.  My conscience doesn't allow me to just ask for money. 

I'm ready to work in any legal or official capacity. 

The most important thing is that I need help as soon as possible.  If I were alone, I'd just move into my car and live there.  But I have pets, my sister, and my girlfriend (regardless of our relationship status, I love her and want to be with her).  We might be evicted, and there are all these debts. 

I'm desperate. 

Please, help in any way you can. 

I’ve been meaning to write this post for about a month now. It’s extremely hard for me to ask anyone for help.

But the situation has gotten to a point where I just don’t know what else to do. I’ve even started thinking about disappearing far into the northern forests, living off whatever I can find — and maybe one day meeting a bear, for whom I’d make a decent dinner.

Three weeks after I first started writing this, I managed to find a side job, but it brings in no more than €200 a week. On top of that, my car — which I need for this job — broke down.
I’ve received a couple of contacts regarding possible work, but so far, no responses. And even if I do get something, it would likely be a job with around €2,500 monthly salary — which wouldn’t be enough to pay off all my debts quickly. That means we could still be evicted from our apartment, and there could be many more problems.

For about 10 years now, I’ve dreamed of starting my own business. I’ve thought about opening a small café, and also creating clothes with custom prints or embroidery — but for now, these remain just dreams.

I’m doing my best not to give up, but with each passing day, each passing hour, it’s getting harder.

I don’t want to ask for financial help — but I also realize that financial help might be the only thing that could truly save me right now.

I am willing to repay it in time — whether by working, paying it back directly, or helping someone else the same way I was helped. I’ve always tried to help others throughout my life, and now the time has come where I’m the one who needs help.

I’m really sorry for this long post.
And I’m truly sorry for asking for help — it’s extremely difficult and shameful for me to do so.

I don’t know… maybe u/MrBeast could help me.
When I watch his videos, where he does so many amazing things for people — often in situations even worse than mine — it makes me want to help others again, like I used to.
But right now, I can’t even help myself.

Everything feels so difficult. I’m lost.

povertyfinance,credit card debt,"Being sued by US Bank for $10,500 in credit card debt","I don’t know what to do. I found out last week that US Bank/Zwicker and Associates filed a civil suit against me for defaulted credit card debt. They offered me a payment plan option of $400/month or a lump sum payment option of $6100. 

I can’t afford $400/month and I have no way of coming up with $6100 besides maybe from an extremely high-interest loan for people with bad credit. 

I live in Oregon where wage garnishment is 25% so if I don’t resolve it before May 30 (the 30 day deadline of being served), I assume the judge will will have my wages garnished at 25%. I make next to nothing and a lot of the money I make is paid to me in cash. 

I don’t know what to do. There’s a big part of me that just wants to leave the state and move to one where there isn’t wage garnishment, like Texas - where I’m from and where I have friends and family - and negotiate with them from there. 

I guess my questions are: does anyone who’s been though something similar have any advice? What your thoughts on taking out a high interest loan to make the lump sum payment?

I’m not worried about ruining my credit - it’s already ruined and will be for the rest of my life.

povertyfinance,credit card debt,I cut up two of my credit cards today.,"After finally being able to access a savings account, set up by family when I was born.

In total, I paid off a little less than $7,000 in total across 4 cards, leaving me around $900 to pay off.


I opened my first credit account with one of those “starter” cards. 12 years and I never took a limit increase, declined every time I was prompted. But about two months ago, I received an email that the credit line had been raised to $1,700… I almost immediately maxed it out.
The majority came from a Travel Rewards card I applied for before I left for Italy, my senior year of college. (Student loan debt is another story I’m not ready to speak on.)
I applied expecting to be approved for $500, maybe $1,000. Just a little cushion to supplement the money I’d worked to save for my 4 weeks abroad.

Ultimately, I maxed that one. Spent all my trip money, and the credit card, except about €462.
I tried, numerous times since 2019 to get it paid off. I did once, but… then again. And I couldn’t get ahead.


I’m recently sober, and my family thankfully sees & agrees I have made notable progress.. in so many more realms than regarding finances!
I was honest with my parents— although they’re separated nearly 21 years— that I was thinking of taking the money from my 401k or Roth IRA I have set up with my job.

I didn’t intend to ask for help… but my dad said something that I saw my opportunity & knew I only had one way out of this hole, so that I can really begin to fully move on to a new chapter in my life. A sober, smarter, chapter.


I absolutely understand my fortune, and that I was given an opportunity so many people do not have. My father wasn’t present for much of my life, even before my mom split. We didn’t even have a relationship until ~4 years ago. But my dad and his mother began saving for my sister and I, the day we were born. My sister is older and has not been allowed access to her accounts. They were really meant to be saved until our grandparents and dad pass away. We have never had much, but my dad’s family sock away money like they get paid to do it. It’s been incredible to learn about.

I am so lucky today, and only wish the best for everyone else who struggles in this day and age— aka, all of us. I still have almost $70k in loans, with a grad school application to finish for the upcoming 2025 Fall semester. But I feel so much freer already. I am so tired of fucking my own life and being reckless. With my time, potential, and money. I’m done.

povertyfinance,credit card debt,Started my dream job as a flight attendant… and I’m financially sinking.,"I recently became a flight attendant for a major U.S. airline, and it’s been financially devastating.

I used to make around $5,000/month in a flexible job, had no debt, and was managing well. I got hired as an FA in October 2023 and was told I’d go to unpaid training in February 2024. So I quit my old job.

Then things went sideways: they sent me home on Day 1 of training due to paperwork delays. I didn’t end up going back to training until July 2024 leaving me unemployed for 6 months with no income. I tried to get other work, but by the time I found something, training was around the corner again.

During that time, I relied heavily on credit cards. Now I'm in debt and barely making ends meet on less than $2,500/month. One credit card account was recently closed after a returned payment and being over the limit for too long. I'm in a financial relief program with Amex and got my APR reduced to 9.99%, but I'm still drowning.

After bills, I have nothing left over no savings, no wiggle room. I’m not even sure how to start climbing out of this.

Now here’s where it gets tricky. Since starting college, he’s picked up some unhealthy habits—drinking and smoking with friends, which has added up. On top of that, he maxed out his credit card on stuff he didn’t even need. Recently, he gave a bunch of cash to a friend for something trendy. Well, surprise his friend bailed, and now he's in serious debt.

Now he’s asking me for money, saying it’ll help him get out of the mess he’s in. I want to be supportive, but I don’t want to fuel a cycle that could make things worse, either. Part of me wonders if helping him financially will just encourage his bad habits.

povertyfinance,drowning in debt,Finally breathed easy after 6 years of drowning in debt,"I'm sitting here almost in tears because I just paid my bills without having to choose which ones to put off. Six years ago, I was sleeping in my car between double shifts, showering at the gym, and eating nothing but ramen and whatever was on clearance.

The turning point wasn't some miracle or windfall. It was mind-numbingly boring stuff: I got a notebook and wrote down every single purchase, even the 50¢ gum. Seeing those numbers on paper hit different. I realized I was spending $40/month on ATM fees alone because I was always using the closest machine when broke.

Started walking 15 minutes to my actual bank. Started meal prepping even though I hate cooking. Got a $12 coffee maker instead of buying $5 gas station coffee every morning. None of this was fun or instagram-worthy, but watching my account slowly stop hitting zero every week kept me going.

The real game-changer was picking up cleaning gigs through an app. Just 2-3 houses every weekend. That extra $200-300 a month went straight to paying off my highest interest credit card. Took 18 months, but I killed that debt. Then the next one. Then the next.

Today I have $1000 in savings. That's probably nothing to most people, but to me it's everything. It means I can get my prescription filled without waiting for payday. It means I can buy toilet paper in bulk when it's on sale instead of paying more for single rolls.

I'm still not ""comfortable"" by any means. But I'm not in constant panic mode anymore, and that feeling is worth more than I can describe. If you're where I was - it's possible to climb out. Slowly. Boringly. But possible.

Edit: Holy crap, thank you all for the kind words and awards. Never expected this to blow up like this. To those asking - yes, it really did take 6 years. Progress wasn't linear.

I’ve worked as a server for this restaurant for 3 years. It’s near my apartment, I like the staff and clientele and most importantly the hours are amazing. Open 4-10. So no late nights. I generally make around 200 on week days (although sometimes as low as 160) and usually hit 300 on Saturday. However I only get scheduled 3 days a week. I’ve never made over 900 a week, it’s mostly 600-700 a week. This is not sustainable and I’ve been racking up credit card debt (8k ish). I’d feel very comfortable at 1100 a week. 

I have 6 years of nyc restaurant experience and I apply for jobs every morning and I’ve only had 4 interviews in several months. I don’t even want to work at a restaurant anymore but on paper I should be able to at least get an interview for one. I have a BA in theatre as well. 

I’ve applied to some office jobs but it’s hard to know what I’m qualified for. I had an interview for a remote politics job that I thought I nailed but I didn’t get it. 

I’ve been pursuing/occasionally working as an actor in the past few years but I’ve also not had an audition in a year cuz it’s so slow. Acting is still the dream but I am legit getting nervous about paying bills so I’ll do anything. 

My biggest expenses are rent (1550 to live alone in Manhattan, I can’t move) 320 for 4 therapy sessions a month (might cut 2 of em) and then utilities are like 200 and then food. I don’t think I’m spending crazy money, I just barely have a job but I also can’t seem to get an interview anywhere. Most of my server/bartender friends are also having the same issue. I think the server jobs getting posted are being applied to by like 300 people nowadays. 

One positive is my insurance told me I was poor enough to qualify for a wayyy cheaper plan lol. 

Any ideas what I can do? I feel so stuck.

I was also very recently served papers from my banking institution for a defaulted credit card so… running out of options here. ",12,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/1izt7f5/drowning_in_debt_and_dont_what_to_do_i_need_advice/,1740697501.0,AJxss,1izt7f5,advice_seeking
povertyfinance,drowning in debt,I work full-time and I’m still homeless. I don’t know how much longer I can do this.,"I work full-time. I make about $2,000 a month, and when I do overtime, maybe $2500and it kills my body 
And still… I live in my car.

Rent in Florida is unbearable. Just trying to survive and stay safe as a woman has left me drowning in credit card debt. The interest alone is over $1,200 a month.

If I stop paying, I’ll lose my credit.
If I lose my credit, I’ll lose my car — the last safe place I have.
My storage unit can only be paid by credit card. If I can’t charge it anymore… I’ll lose everything. I have 10 days before it all collapses.

I’ve been homeless for almost a year.
I don’t party. I don’t waste. I don’t ask for much. I work. I stay clean. I try to show up for life like everyone else.

I can’t afford food stamps — I “make too much” on paper to qualify. But that paper doesn’t show what it costs to survive without a home. It doesn’t show how many hours I spend just looking for a safe place to park or a bathroom to use. It doesn’t show what it means to live in fear and exhaustion every single day.

And the options I can afford? They cost me in other ways.

If I rent a room in a very low-income area, it’s hell.
It feels like I have to betray my peace, my safety, even my values just to have a place to sleep.
People cross boundaries, try to break down who I am. I feel like I’m being asked to sacrifice my integrity, my identity, my soul — just to have shelter.
And still, it’s not safe.

I eat the cheapest food I can find. I’m constantly hungry, dizzy, gaining weight from food that hurts me. My body is tired. I don’t even have time to go to the doctor. Being homeless consumes every single hour.

And I’m alone.
The few times I’ve opened up to people around me — they turned on me. Some coworkers laughed behind my back. People get curious about my life just to stab me later. It’s like some people enjoy watching a woman fall apart.

I’ve always been a good person. I’ve helped people. I’ve comforted strangers. I’ve given from nothing. I believe in God. I pray. I try. But lately… it feels like even He has left me.

I had big dreams. I thought I was meant to do something good in this world. And now? I just feel like I’m disappearing. Like I don’t matter.
Like I can’t carry this anymore.

Sometimes I think maybe it would be easier to stop existing.
And that scares me.

I’m not asking for money. I just don’t know where else to put this.
I need to be seen. I need someone to tell me that I’m not crazy, that this is real, that I’m not weak for breaking down.

Have you ever made it out of something like this?
Or even just survived it?

povertyfinance,debt snowball,What do I do?,"I have so much debt I don’t even know what to do anymore. I (27F) have $40,000 in credit card debt. If we include my car and student loans, $56,000. I got my medical assisting certificate when I was 19/20 and have worked as one since. When I was 22 I got pregnant (not planned) and at the time I was still living at home with my parents, who never charged me rent or any type of bill so I had around $10,000 in just savings. I’ve worked since I was able to get a job and have always been good with my money, of course since I lived at home and was young, I would take little weekend “vacations” and do as I wanted, while still making sure I had a savings. 

When I had my son I was 23, my fiance and I had moved into our first apartment a few months prior to birth. My fiance made great money at the time, I was working full time and everything was perfectly fine. Only debt I had was my car and student loans. I had many credit cards but was always able to pay them off. I went into preterm labor at 30 weeks and was put on bedrest, so I was unable to work anymore. My job started my maternity leave early and told me I would still be able to have my full maternity leave after baby was born. This was a lie. They were trying to make me come back before I was even 6 weeks post partum. They said the only way I’d be able to have my “full” leave with my baby was if my boss approved my time off, unpaid. I asked my boss if I could have my time I was supposed to have off with my baby (which was only like another 1.5 months) and she declined and said I was needed back. My fiancé and I were plenty well off at the time so we agreed he would pay the bills and I would stay home with our son (to avoid insane childcare costs) till he was a bit older and I could find another job. 2 months into this, my fiance unexpectedly lost his job. We burnt through our savings so fast. He could not find a decent job that was paying well, so he was job hopping a lot. I was trying to find a job that would work with me so I could still keep my son and avoid childcare costs. We were denied every type of assistance for “making too much” so we could not get any help. We used our credit cards to pay all the bills in this time we struggled. Rent at times (which was $1450), electricity, phone bills, car insurance, you name it. I used credit cards to buy most of our groceries as well. Fast forward to now (2.5 ish years later) I have accumulated all of this debt. 90%-95% of this is just from literally trying to survive which feels like a punch in the gut. Of course we would use credit cards occasionally to buy a few birthday/Christmas presents for our son to at least try to make things special for him. I have a part time remote job (all they were hiring for) that I’m able to keep my son with me for. My fiancé has a great job with great benefits but works so much that it would be hard for me to even get a full time job/another in person job due to childcare. I have not been using my credit cards. But my minimum payments are barely more than the interest I’m getting charged. I can’t afford to pay more than the minimums either. I pay roughly $1250 in credit card minimums and only bring home roughly $2,000 monthly. This does not leave a lot of room for my other bills… I’ve cut all unnecessary expenses like subscriptions etc, I stopped buying things like paper plates, bowls etc. I have been doing meal plans and only buy the things we need for those   meals at the store to avoid eating out, although we still do eat out maybe once a week on the weekend. 

I guess my question is what do I do? I have never missed a credit card payment ever. Do I stop paying some of them so I can focus that bit of money to a different credit card so I can snowball the debt? Do I just stop paying all of them and let them go to collections then try to settle on a lower amount/payment so I can potentially just pay it off quicker? Do I get a personal loan and consolidate? Do I do a debt relief program? Bankruptcy? I’m at a loss and I’m so tired of being stressed about this. We were both raised lower middle class, we have never had tons of money and neither have our families. We don’t live a luxurious life or have fancy things, or even really spend money on things we do not need. The cost of living on top of debt is just kicking us in the ass. We don’t have many people we could go to for advice about this.

I really would like to keep at least one credit card open for strictly emergencies. My mom was recently hospitalized, she has no health insurance and she hasn’t been able to return to her regular working schedule yet due to her rare diagnosis and still trying to recover. She is on tons of medication, and I’m worried she will need help paying for one of the medications that’s insanely expensive, and I want to be able to assist if I need to (I am working on getting her insurance and/or some type of assistance to help pay for this medication) Or if something happens to a vehicle or our animals, etc I want to be able to handle it without the stress of how. My credit score is 624, so not terrible for my situation, but also not that great.

The cleaning job pays $16–$17/hour, and while the hours can vary, I’m aiming for about 20 hours a week. That would bring me to around 60 hours a week total when combined with my full-time job as a business analyst.

I also have a car loan and student loans, which I’ll need to start repaying in August, but for now, my priority is knocking out the credit card debt.

Just looking for some advice or encouragement. I’m feeling the pressure big time right now.

I’m currently between jobs (starting a new one soon that pays $70K), but right now things are tight. All of my credit cards are nearly maxed out:
	•	$5,757 / $6,000
	•	$1,950 / $2,000
	•	$12,400 / $12,500
	•	$2,200 / $2,500

That’s $22,307 out of $23,000 in available credit — basically 97% utilization. I also have a car payment on top of that, and until the new job’s paycheck kicks in, things feel really overwhelming.

I’ve been making minimum payments just to stay afloat, but I know this isn’t sustainable. I’m open to any advice on how to dig myself out of this hole:
	•	Should I look into a debt consolidation loan or a balance transfer card?
	•	Snowball vs avalanche method — any real-world tips?
	•	Is it worth talking to a credit counselor at this point?

I’m not looking to give up — just need a solid plan. If anyone’s been here and come out the other side, I’d love to hear what worked for you.

povertyfinance,debt snowball,What do you do when your only option is a payday loan?,"To make a long story short: I’m not in a great position financially (hence why I’m here).  I’ve got some credit card debt, can’t afford my car payment/registration but need it to get to work, my job barely pays enough for rent, utilities, and food.  I’m locked into this job for another 6 months, then I’m going to make a change.  I got a little behind on some bills like internet/phone, so each month comes with a late fee right now and I can’t make enough of a payment to catch up.  I’ve also gotten myself stuck in the loop of payday advance apps (like Dave, FloatMe, etc) so each paycheck, a good chunk of it goes to paying those back with the associated fees.

I want to be able to catch up on loans/bills and register my car, but because of the missed car payments and closed credit cards, my credit score isn’t where it needs to be to get a traditional loan.  If I had a jumpstart of like $2000-3000 to get caught up, I’d be able to scrape by without having to worry about repossession anymore or a snowball effect of continued late fees and credit hits.  Because I’m getting a new job (and likely a new apartment with cheaper rent) in 6 months, I know I’ll have more income and will be able to start paying off a loan then, but that’s not something I can prove now to a reputable lender.  I don’t want to be considering a payday loan because I fully understand how predatory they are, but I truly don’t see another option right now.  My family is unfortunately unable to help me.  I do have 2 gig jobs in addition to my main job, but my main job has odd hours, so maintaining a consistent second job is very difficult (I tried for about 8 months and could not make the schedules work, so I risked being fired for how many scheduling changes I was requesting and ended up cutting back to one).

I have mid to low 600s credit, but have received calls that I qualify for the amount I need to consolidate all of my debt into one large loan for a good monthly payment that would be easy to handle, would take the place of a higher significant monthly payment I currently have for another loan, and I would have extra disposable income to actually put aside savings and put extra towards paying down double or triple towards the consolidation loan.

Also been in and out of mental hospitals between all that so many times due to my dual diagnosis mental health and addiction issues. Have also been homeless for most of my adult life when I wasn't institutionalized. I'm on disability for my mood disorders and on my fixed income I'm left with very little after paying all my basic bills. My birthday is also coming up on the 23rd and will be my first free birthday in 7 years! So that's really exciting. But what I'm more excited about is my recovery and how I kicked the needle and dope again and am coming up on 7 months clean. I have a sponsor. I hold a service position in my home group for NA. I'm the one in charge of giving people their milestones keytags and a hug when they hit them. They come up and get it and everyone claps and it makes me feel really good to hand these amazing achievements to these individuals. A couple of them had even been my really good friends that are just a few months behind me in recovery. I recently handed them their 3 month key tags. My uncle who I love dearly almost like a father figure is also in recovery now but he just doesn't do groups or anything. But he told me it was my success that helped inspire him to do it.

Anyways I posted here before but didn't know all the rules so now I'm trying again and just wanted to introduce myself while also asking the community if they had any advice or tips on making some sort of side money. Something that wouldn't interfere with my social security disability.

I'm just desperate for some more kind of security or additional income. I really don't know what I'm doing. I'm trying to go back to school, but I'm going through jumping through hoops for the department of education to try and get my old student loans from YEARS ago; from being in default status. It's going to be a hassle but once I can start the payment plan which someone told me could be 5 dollars a month based off my income, and I do that for 6 months straight; then they will be out of default status allowing me to utilize FAFSA for going back to school. I plan right now on pursuing my professional writing bachelor's online from Grand Canyon University. They have already been talking to me and they have accepted me and everything.

I am not sure if this is the place, but what I am in feels like poverty or close to it. I am 26 years old and get a monthly budget of approximately 3.6k.

I was carless and decided that with my new job I would get a car (which is a trap I admittedly know I fell for) and am now stuck with a car payment of $718. Because I had a few car accidents which made my insurance payment high, I pay roughly $330 a month for insurance. My phone plan is about $110 and I am unable to leave the plan 1) for fear of not finding a good plan to lower mine and 2) I am in a family plan with my mother and do not want to affect her finances as much as already am. I just renewed a lease before everything caught up to me and I am tied into a $1250 monthly rent agreement. To do the math with utilities that comes out to , that comes out to about $2,408 before and about $2,648 leaving me with a surplus of $952 which does not include gas, food and other things like credit card minimum payments which add up to about $100 a month.

I looked into selling my car, 2025 Honda Civic, and I would end up with negative equity on the car if I were to sell it.  So I am here to ask, should I consider voluntarily forfeiting the car? Somehow my spending habits left me with 110 dollars before I make my phone payment and I still have the insurance payment to take car of after that.

povertyfinance,student loan help,Being sober for a month has been illuminating ,"My husband and I had a night about a month ago where we ended up going out and spending $250 on food/alcohol and it was not a good time. We were very ashamed of this fact and after literally pissing away the equivalent of my monthly student loan payment, my entire phone bill, and a good chunk of our internet bill, we decided we needed to make a change and decided to start small. Our plan was no alcohol for a month and we have kept to that for the most part. My husband's best friend was in town and they went for drinks, so that was the only exception and he asked if I would be okay with it which I was. If I had said no, he wouldn't have gone out but he hasn't seen his friend in months so I felt like it was an acceptable exception. This also led my husband to realize he has a drinking problem because he cannot just stop at a single drink. It is always 0-100 even if he goes with the plan of having one pint. My husband is never mean or acts out when drunk, he gets quite giggly and cuddly so thankfully that's not an issue. That night with his friend was $65. 

When we talked about finances yesterday, I asked if it was worth it and my husband instantly said that it wasn't because he could have bought a really fun video game that would be at least 20 hours of entertainment for less than that (assuming Steam sale). We also made a dedicated plan to record all our expenses onto a shared spreadsheet and we realized that I have a spending problem. Those little Amazon purchases quickly add up, especially when I can just click the ""Buy Now"" option. Just as my husband needs to take care of his drinking problem, I need to take care of my spending problem. We are supporting each other in this and not passing judgement because that does not help the situation.

Part of the plan for this month was also avoid eating out and we have done that, other than ordering two Dominos pizzas on days when we genuinely did not have a chance to make food and were running around. The four topping $15 large pizza is the best deal for us. Since I only eat two slices at a time, this means I have dinner and lunch the following day at work. Coffee is the one thing I can't compromise on no matter how hard I try. The cheaper coffees make me feel genuinely sick and caffeine does nothing for me so I am drinking for the taste and enjoyment of a warm drink. Not buying alcohol has made it so that the $50/month I was spending on nice coffee beans is much more affordable. The amount of money we had been spending on food/alcohol each month was appalling and explains where our disposable income has gone.

This month has also led to a very positive change in my husband. After the night out with his friend, he realized he truly cannot drink anymore without overdoing. He did that about 2 weeks into our month of sobriety and he realized how amazing he'd been feeling without alcohol. He has made a commitment to complete sobriety and not touching alcohol again. We're taking that one day at a time and I am so proud of him.

povertyfinance,ready to buy a house,Literally is there a dummy guide to buy a house? Or am I just dreaming ,"I feel like an idiot. I have NO IDEA how to buy a home or the steps to do so.

Me and my fiance have 3 children. Rent a home that’s falling apart and make roughly 60-80K together yearly. I’m literally making 25$ an hour and not even making enough to cover bills and save! 

Our credits need work. But it’s not horrible. We want to buy a home within the next 3 years, 5 max. Our kids are growing and we just want to be comfortable because the truth is we aren’t! Our living situation is terrible. 

Our landlord is 90, bad health, very neglectful but expects rent of course, verbal contract, month to month cash payments. Been this way for 6 years. 

Ready to just get out and move on. But want to buy, tired of throwing away money for shitty homes. Spent 60K on a house I don’t even own. Something about that hurts my soul. The utilities are also triple what they should be because the floor is sinking and the doors are rigged on the house and don’t fit. All the heat/air runs right out and the systems never stop running. 

Nobody taught me how to buy a home, or how this goes. I just want better for my family 😢 ",82,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/1ekvx7a/literally_is_there_a_dummy_guide_to_buy_a_house/,1722884201.0,Master-Marzipan-3310,1ekvx7a,advice_seeking
povertyfinance,ready to buy a house,I escaped a bed bugs and roaches infested ~30m² shared accommodation of 19 people at 24,"I've been living in a shared accommodation with 18 other people in a 1 bedroom, 1 hall, 1 bathroom and 1 kitchen apartment for almost 2 years, about \~30m² (\~322.92ft²) in size, because I had no better option because I was in a bad financial position and housing is very expensive, and returning to my country was not an option due to war, but about a week ago, I finally managed to pay the down payment on a \~20m² studio apartment, which has been insanely expensive and excruciatingly difficult because you need to pay 3-4 months in advance, a 1 month security deposit, 5-10% commission of annual rent, electricity and water deposit, and pay for furniture and appliances, all while living paycheck to paycheck, and the monthly apartment rent costs like 2-3 times more than the accommodation rent cost.

18 people, 8 bunk beds, one wet mattress on the floor.

The most horrible thing about it was that we were 19 people sharing just one bathroom, mornings were a literal nightmare were you either had to wake up really early or had to wait in queue upwards of an hour and a half just waiting to enter the bathroom, only for others to knock on the door on you 3s-1m after, urging you to exit thinking you were the last person still in the bathroom, causing you to be late to work, and miss appointments.

**Sleep?** There was no peace, there was no quiet, you had roommates blasting music, talking on the phone, watching videos on their phone, not using earphones, and talking in the room, even at 11pm, or even 1am, with the lights on, and since different roommates had different shifts and work schedules, there was literally no quiet all day, always noisy, not to mention the AC that is so old and loud it sounds like a jet engine. There was so much noise overall that I had to buy noise cancelling headphones and wear them 24/7 to protect my ears to the point where the headphones pads started to have a bed smell due to almost never taking them off, just to be able to have peace, and to be able to sleep, and not risk getting a hearing injury.

**Privacy?** What's that? You only get a curtain in your lower bunk bed that at any given moment would be opened without any warning to tell you something or ask you to move your things. Changing your clothes? Your roommates now saw your private parts. Using your laptop/phone? Your screen is now fully visible to them. Sleeping? Your roommates now saw your awkward sleeping position, and they don't even close the curtain back. Especially that my bunk bed was right next to the AC switch they constantly turn on and off, meaning absolutely zero privacy. Heck, there's no room to even fart even if you leave the room because there are people in the hallway, kitchen, and the bathroom too. You want to talk to family or friends? You have absolutely zero privacy because everyone can hear what you're saying on the call. Video calls? Everyone can see who you're talking to.

**Storage Space?** Wardrobes? That's a luxury we never had. You have a 1.9x1x0.3m storage space under your bunk bed that is shared with two people, leaving you with about \~0.285m² (3.07ft²) to put all your clothes, cutlery, toiletries, laundry, devices, food, and personal belongings, or you'd have to put them on your thin bunk bed and have no space left to sleep. To put that into perspective, imagine one and a half luggage bags, that's it. Night stand? That's your remaining 10cm (0.32ft) of space on your bed after you want to sleep on it, unless you want to sleep in the street. And for your cutlery, pans, and utensils? You only get a 0.25m² (2.70ft²) cupboard space.

**Electricity?** You want to use an air fryer? A hair dryer? AC? Too bad, You're not allowed to use electricity beyond your mobile charger and laptop, not even for AC, during scorching Summer heat, you're only allowed to turn it on at night for like 10 hours a day, meaning you're constantly sweating and having to change your clothes or almost hyperventilating from the heat, and when they do turn it on, they set it so low to the point where you're shivering under your cover, and you have to run to the balcony from your bed in the morning to warm up a little bit before going back inside to freeze while you get ready.

**Hygiene?** Your roommates don't shower for a week, where you have to wear a literal mask to be able to sleep and not suffocate.

**Washing Machine?** You want to wash your clothes? Too bad, You have 19 people using one small washing machine, where you're only allowed to use the quick setting, and your clothes come out reeking like a sewer because it's almost never cleaned, and it's almost always running all day to the point where you have to book your place after the next person in line just to wash your clothes. You want to air dry your clothes? 19 people share a single 2m (6.56ft) rod where you have to hang your clothes with clothes hangars and they get so cramped every time they're about to dry your roommates' wet clothes seep into yours. Also, a dryer? Yea, there's no chance.

**Cleanliness?** There's no soap, you have to carry your own to use it in the bathroom or kitchen, and the bathroom floor is always wet and full of hair. Shared pots and pans are so dirty that the sun wouldn't be able to shine on the blackness, and they're just washed then stored, they don't even use dish soap. You would literally wake up and see roaches next to you on the pillow, and your body full of bed bugs bites, and if you enter the kitchen and turn on the lights, 100-200 roaches would scurry away hiding.

**Food?** You want to eat? You want to cook? Too bad, 19 people use a single cooktop with two burners and a single fridge, where you can only cramp 1-2 food containers in it, drastically reducing your cooking options to only quick meals like noodles or soup and limiting your meal serving size to only one serving per day because you can't have leftovers, because there's almost no space in the fridge, and they'd go bad outside the fridge. This has drastically affected me leaving me unable to make healthy food options because they usually take longer to make and require more fridge space to store more servings. And if you want to use water to cook, you're not allowed to use drinking water, only tap water, even if you're cooking something like soap.

**Shower?** You can use the bathroom for a maximum of 5 minutes, and if you're lucky, 15m, before others start knocking on the door because you're ""taking too long"", and you have to carry your toiletries and clothes with you every single time, and you're not allowed to leave your stuff in the bathroom, so you have to change your clothes inside the bathroom, and risk dropping them on the filthy floor full of hair, so you're always carrying almost a bag worth of things for every shower, increasing the friction so much that you don't even want to take a shower anymore.

**Clean breathing?** Who needs air anyway? There's a constant flow of roommates smoking one after the other, putting so much passive smoking into the air, that you can't even stay in the kitchen, and even have to wear a mask to be able to sleep. Not to mention that neighbors who live in similar accommodations sometimes cook food that reeks so much you can't even breathe without a mask.

**Peace of mind?** You're constantly worrying that any given moment you'll be evicted and become homeless, because this type of accommodation is illegal in the first place, despite being so common and infesting the society, and you can't afford to leave in a legal accommodation because you have to pay almost a year's worth of rent in advance, while you're skipping meals to survive living paycheck to paycheck.

The only positives of this place were that it was cheap compared to other options, it had a fast internet connection to maintain 19 people using it, and smoking wasn't allowed in the sleeping area, although the smoke kept coming from the kitchen and the balcony.



I've now moved into my own studio apartment, and I've been sleeping on the floor without air conditioning the past week, washing manually with my hand, and eating canned food because there's no fridge or furniture or anything, but I don't care, I feel soooooo much better, I love the peace, I love the quiet, I love being able to use the bathroom whenever I want and for however long I want. I love being able to breathe clean air without the atrocious smoke or vape poison.

My stuff are on the floor because there's no wardrobe yet, but I have space to put my things, I don't have to cramp everything into one place.

I have privacy now, I can talk to friends and family, have calls, have video calls, all without having to worry about others hearing every single thing I say.

I can now save up to get a desktop computer, because I pay for my own electricity, and I have space for it.

I can now exercise, because there's actually space to move around, or even stretch.

I can now have a place to sit, instead of only being in bed every day for 2 years.

I can even have a cat adopt me.

I can now play sound out loud without earphones.

I can now sleep on my side without bulky headphones twisting my neck and causing ache.

I can now improve my sleep schedule and actually have sleep, I've been having sleep problems and dark circles the past 3 years either due to the lights being on, noise, too much heat, too much cold, smoke, or even roommates waking me up.

I can now eliminate bed bugs and cockroaches without having them come back the next day due to lack of hygiene.

I can leave my toiletries in the bathroom without having to lug them every time I want to take a shower, you have no idea how much peace this gives me.

When I get a fridge, I'll be able to cook more than one serving, and have meals ready to eat for when I'm too lazy to cook a whole meal, or even meal prep.

I could even return to my drawing hobby I quit 6 years ago.

I got a washing machine yesterday, and I put my clothes for a longer cycle, and they didn't smell like a sewer afterwards, they smelled clean, I no longer have to worry about having to put too much perfume to cover their smell or having to shower and change clothes 1-2 times every single day.

I'm so happy that I don't have to go back there, I'm free, I escaped that place, I'm free.",1288,https://i.redd.it/ek01e08lqj1f1.jpeg,1747576679.0,DevastatingMYTH,1kpklba,advice_seeking
povertyfinance,ready to buy a house,fvk it - im going to buy a mobile home,"Edit: original post below the line. You guys are right. Owning the land is the right way to go but these new manufactured homes are just unbeatable. Will be able to exit the rental market (which also keeps going up) and these homes are move in ready and come furnished with all the appliances you need. People are just being nasty about ""living in a trailer"" also below is a response I have to a lot of people: 

What else are we supposed to in this housing market/economy? I did everything I was supposed to. I worked really hard in high school. Got scholarships. Had to move out due to home situation so I took out minimal subsidized loans to help with living expenses while working in college for a STEM degree. Got a corporate job out of college. (Above median annual salary in this country mind you). Even got a second job for a while. Fiance works overtime a lot and struggles to find something that would pay more since he doesn't have a college degree. Been saving up and doing all the financial tricks and we will just never be able to comfortably afford what we should be able to. So even with working a job I hate we'd be barely scraping by just to live in a ""proper house"" with probably no backyard anyway and have to pay for childcare so I can go to work. Just doesn't seem worth it.

They have a house in the suburbs of Houston, but can no longer afford it after their divorce and worsening mental illness. Repairs are long overdue and it's in bad shape, but it's a great neighborhood with a great school district. Even unrepaired, I imagine it'd sell for at least $200k more than they purchased it for almost two decades ago.

I know nothing about houses and mortgages. Unfortunately I don't know much about their other debt either. I want to help them, but don't even know where to start. All I know is that it seems monumental to move without expendable income and time. Do I have them pack a bag and try to get an apartment lease? Then estate sale everything inside and start fresh? For what it's worth, they seem ready to jump ship with just a few belongings, but they don't seem to like the idea of renting. I think being held accountable to a landlord would do them well, but I recognize that they need to ""buy in"" and want to get out of this financial hole themselves.

povertyfinance,ready to buy a house,How I kept my rent from going up this year…,"Like most of you. Our rent goes up every year. Without anything changing. Actually. With us taking on more of the homeowners responsibilities. For instance. Repairs on things they don’t want to fix ( AC ) for one. Last year our AC went out in the summer and it got to like 92 in our house. After 4 days of this I told them I was putting us in a hotel and would send them the bill. They told us. The law states we don’t even have to provide AC to you. So when I leave I’ll be taking a motor from the AC I guess lol. At any rate. I probably could have handled it different but 4 days. 90+ degrees. I was ready to kill someone. At any rate. It came time to renew our lease and it was raised the last 2 years. And we pay a ridiculous amount. About 2500 a month. We were trying to buy a house but I couldn’t commit with the current market and yadda yadda. CEO died. Started a new job. Figure we will wait. 

So at the time of the lease I wanted to make sure our rent would not go up. I wrote a detailed letter to the homeowner and property management company stating how 1) we loved the house 2) we loved the neighborhood 3) we treat this home as our own 4) we’ve never been late and don’t bother them with frivolous repairs 5) there are places in the very same neighborhood that are the same layout and 200 cheaper a month. And then elaborated on these things.

I then requested that this year the rent go DOWN to match the other homes in the neighborhood. Knowing they would never do this, but mainly wanting things to stay the same, And not wanting to move and the inconvenience of all that. Well. It worked. They said we have been great tenants and they would not be raising the rent this year. 

Idk. Thought I would run this by the subreddit and see if any of you have done this. Or if you are in a similar situation to try it out.

povertyfinance,ready to buy a house,How to I get my finances in order,"
So here’s where we’re at financially:

I’m currently a stay-at-home mom and not working at the moment. We have some credit card debt and are trying to get serious about budgeting, paying off debt, and saving for a house.

**Debt:**
- I have $3,000 in credit card debt spread across three cards  
- My partner has $500 in credit card debt  
- I also have $8,000 in student loans  
- We’re still paying off a car seat — $75/month with $323.25 left  

**Income:**
- My partner is the only one working right now and makes $36–$39/hour depending on the job site.  
- I graduate college this week and will be starting work around June, making somewhere between $50K–$60K/year.

**Our current monthly bills look like this:**
- Rent (May 1st): $1,000  
- Water (19th): $124.40  
- Electric (20th): $203.23  
- Car Insurance (15th): $192.16  
- Phone Bill (15th): $65  
- Wi-Fi (21st): $55  
- Disney+ (1st): $20  
- Apple Music (10th): $6  
- Spotify (21st): $12  
- Xbox Live (26th): $10  
- Credit Card Payments:  
  - Firelands (15th): $40  
  - Discover (18th): $100 (Balance: $1,700)  
  - Capital One (17th): $40 (Balance: $100)  
- Car seat loan (17th): $75 (Balance: $323.25)

**Savings:**
- $800 in cash savings  
- $2,000 in savings bonds  

**Our goals:**
- Pay off credit card debt  
- Start saving aggressively for a house  
- Buy a small starter home after my partner hits his 2-year mark at work this November  

**Other upcoming expenses:**
- We’ll be hiring a nanny when I start working since I’ll be working from home. She charges $80/day or $40 for a half day and brings her daughter with her. Depending on how much my mom helps, we expect to pay around $300–$400/week for childcare.

**Here’s what I need advice on:**
- How do we structure our money once I start working?  
- Should we pay off all the credit cards first before saving for a house, or split our money between debt and savings?  
- Should we try to live off one income and save the other?  

I’ve never been taught anything about finances, and I’ve definitely been overspending (daily coffee runs, unnecessary purchases). I cut all of that out last week and I’m really ready to make a change. We want to stop living paycheck to paycheck and build toward something real.

Any advice or budgeting strategies are appreciated!

povertyfinance,ready to buy a house,Chance to Downsize House - 5 person family,"So my wife and I have an unexpected opportunity to move to a cheaper house out in a rural area.  For context, our current house in a suburban area is worth about $330k.  This house in the country is going to sell for about $215k.  We would also pay lower taxes and utilities.  I'm trying to decide if this is a good idea.

The cons:

Current house is aboard 3,000 square feet with 5 bedrooms and 3 baths.  The new house would be 3 bedrooms and 1.5 baths.

Longer drives to get to places.  Someday I work from home, many other days I have to travel a lot for field work.  Might not get home till 7pm some days.

The pros:

I owe $220k on a house worth about $330k.  It would need some work to sell at full value, but I could easily put $50-$60k down on the ""new"" house.  The new house would then either have a lower monthly mortgage, or a faster payoff time. 

The new house is at least 1 acre out in the country and surrounded by farmland.  Kids would have plenty of chances to play and explore outside.

I would buying the house from a friend of mine, so I know lots about the ownership for the past 8 years and the home condition.  It is move-in ready. 

My wife is a SAHM and homeschools, so we don't have to worry about transferring school districts. I assure you, my kids are extremely social and this move would not affect their social skills.

What am I missing? We're going to tour the house Friday and then make a decision if we want to pursue.  We weren't intending to move this year, but this seems like a great chance to live below our means for a bit.  

Edit: seems we have very different definitions of ""Rural"".  There is a good-sized town less than 15 minutes from this house.  It's just further from the major Metropolitan area we are used to being.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/1hzuput/chance_to_downsize_house_5_person_family/,1736710259.0,Ezra611,1hzuput,advice_seeking
povertyfinance,ready to buy a house,Is it Worth Consolidating Debt?,"Hey yall, I'm pretty new here so not sure if this is a commonly asked question, hoping to get some opinions or insight from people who've decided to consolidate their debt. 

I'm 27, make about 50k a year and have around 30k in debt, mostly split between student loans and car payments with a few thousand in in CC debt. My partner and I rent a house from her dad and are hoping to buy it when he's ready to sell. I'm also not struggling to pay off my debt, I am able to save some money and not live hand to mouth, but my interest rates on existing loans are pretty high, especially my car and credit card. 

I understand the decision to consolidate varies from person to person, and is largely dependent on what interest rates I have/could get on a new loan. So, assuming I can get a personal loan with interest below my current loans, would it be worth it considering I'm looking at buying a house in the foreseeable future? And is it generally better to get a personal loan or go through a debt consolidation company?

povertyfinance,buy vs rent,Anyone aware of grants or reputable financing?,"I bought my home 6 years ago which turned out to be not the best investment. I'd been saving to buy for years and was just about there. My rent increased 30+% in 2 years. So I exhilarated my home purchase. 
This was a year into the housing cost boom. I placed offers and was outbid with cash offers, the listing prices began to jump 10% - 30% and of course my 1bd apartment rent was increasing yet again. I became a Lyft driver and IC working in contracts within my routes all while working my regular 9-5. 
With the rapid incline in the housing market, working full time with my side gigs wouldn't leave much for saving.
My daughter was growing and needed her own room so instead of shelling out for a 2 bd. rental I bought my home. 
Within just a few months of purchasing I became ill.  I was reliant on LTD benefits who required I apply for SSDI/SSI but was initially denied. 
Someone hit the side of my house with a full-sized SUV right at the start of Covid. Insurance covered most but new home repairs were also necessary. More health conditions, re-applied for SSI. LTD insurer denied me further benefits in the midst of covid. 
Fast foward to present, I've exhausted retirement and savings and was on the brink of foreclosure. SSDI finally approved, dating back only 11mos. vs 3yrs (multiple conditions, most stemming back 5yrs). It's was a blessing but all backpay went to past due mortgage and other long overdue bills. I did splurge  about $1K,  can you blame me? Now I regret it. 
Believing my SSDI payment would come the 3rd of the month and I was able to pay down credit, bills on mortgage to enable me to stay current month to month made it easy to treat my daughter and myself. 
To my surprise my SSDI award pays every 3rd Wednesday of the month, this makes my mortgage late which takes on late fees and has a trickle effect with all other bills.
My credit score is below 600 finding a great rate or cc rate increase really isn't an option. 
Anyone aware of a lending source with lower rates for bad credit with long terms 36+ months for $5K? This way I can pay current Mortgage on time, have a month in reserve and stay on top of my other bills.  TIA

povertyfinance,buy vs rent,Its happening!,"Mini update: i have to get to bed but i wanted to thank everyone who reached out. I feel more loved here than i ever have. 
I am already in my local Buy Nothing group and we plan on doing thrift shops as well! 

I have a lot of calls to make tomorrow because of the numerous comments here with other resources i didnt know existed!! 

I will for sure update again once we get into the place. We get keys and sign lease tomorrow (Tuesday) tjen move in Wednesday because thats the soonest Delmarva (my electric co) can turn on the power. I cant wait to share everything. I hope to never experience this kind of low again. I know it will be tough with new challenges now but this will work. It has to. 💙💙

Due to a horrible divorce a few years ago, my kids and i have been living in a motel. I work full time, dont quailfy for food stamps, paying an insane amount of rent and car payments, and kids with medical issues  etc made it impossible to find a rental. There was no way to save for the moving cost and down payments etc. BUT. Finally.  We found a rental. A realtor who owns a property.  Its small, but perfect. My kids can stay in their schools, its close to my work. And its less than this motel room!

I inquired about it and thankfully he has a heart and was willing to give me a much needed chance to prove im a good tenant who pays rent on time and im quiet. I dont party. I work, take care of my kids, sleep, then work again. (And im ok with that! My ideal Saturday night is jammies and movies with my babies and a Wednesday sandwhich picnic blowing bubbles etc)

We move in 2 days. I havent stopped crying. We have nothing to move with but we are finally moving up. It will all come in time. No furniture,  just our clothes. But its happening. Its finally really happening. ",45955,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/1jdsp53/its_happening/,1742258517.0,NotThatFamousGirl,1jdsp53,not_advice_seeking

On one hand, renting offers the flexibility of moving whenever, but at the cost of never building equity. On the other hand, owning a home means signing up for a lifetime of debt and responsibilities, all while watching property taxes skyrocket. Neither option seems particularly appealing when both are ridiculously expensive. Yet, society still insists on pushing the idea that one is better than the other.

What impact do you think this will have on the affordable housing crisis, or will  drastic government intervention measures be required to mitigate the damage from this? 
TLDR: 

""As extreme weather events increase in both frequency and severity, a growing number of insurers are pulling out of disaster-prone regions. That could make homeownership less attainable in the future.""


“Those banks and insurance companies are pulling out of areas, coastal areas and … areas where there are a lot of fires,” Powell told the committee. “So what that’s going to mean is if you fast-forward 10 or 15 years, there are going to be regions of the country where you can’t get a mortgage.”

My landlord recently increased my rent by $200 and I can no longer afford to stay. I can't really afford to move either but that's a totally different story. Anyway, I was on the phone talking to my friend and I mentioned that I was still looking for somewhere cheaper to move to. I'm looking into getting a small apartment, where hopefully I can pay the rent and the power bill only. We go to church and she said God might be trying to tell me to stay where I am. I told her God doesn't want me to be HOMELESS either. I'm renting a house, and I just can't afford rent, power, water,sewer, and trash, natural gas, lawn maintenance and pest control any more. (Lawn maintenance and pest control have fallen by the wayside because I can't afford it). I haven't had cable for years because I can't afford it. My adult children pay my phone bill for me, and I already have the cheapest internet I can find ($10 a month, Xfinity internet essentials) She said I wouldn't be homeless, that I just need to budget. I told her there's nothing to budget. She said I need to cut out ""extras"". I said there aren't any ""extras"" because I don't have money.  I literally only have money for rent and bills (behind on those; she has no idea), car note, car insurance and gas to get back and forth to work. I barely have money for groceries, which led me to tell her I know how to shop for marked down food at the grocery store, and I also know how to go to the food banks. Then she started fussing about how marked down meat isn't good for you and it'll make you sick. (News flash: I've been doing it for a few years now and it hasn't made me sick yet. I have to eat what's on sale. This is just my life.) It's frustrating. She doesn't understand. I just want to cry and scream.

povertyfinance,first home,"The term ""first home"" makes me uncomfortable for some reason.","Just looking to vent and get some thoughts out; apologies for the possible word salad.

As stated in the title, the term ""first home/starter house"" doesn't sit right with me; it might be because it insinuates that you'll buy/sell multiple houses over your lifetime, but how is anyone supposed to afford even one house, let alone a new one in the future?

I live in an average sized city in Canada (nowhere near anything like Vancouver or Toronto, though) where houses average around $500,000CAD at the bare, bare minimum for something old and rundown, up to over $2,000,000CAD for brand-new. 150k-300k houses don't exist here anymore.

With those prices (and not even living in a major city) along with insanely low wages, how can people even look at home ownership? I know a lot of Canadians are moving to the US in pursuit of home ownership because there's more developed land and better currency conversion, but the fact that we have to resort to that is so damn depressing.

I shouldn't have to leave my country to afford a home.

Maybe I'm just a bit down because I'm at the age where those around me are starting to become homeowners and I know I'll probably never join them. I know that there are perks to renting and that a lot of people are only getting houses due to help from family, but still, it doesn't make it hurt any less.

Thanks for reading; just had to get this out. I know most people in this sub are in the USA so I don't see a lot of Canadians on here, but just had to vomit some ranting up real quick.

povertyfinance,first home,How people from poor countries manage to survive in US.,"I'm a immigrant who migrated to US back in 2021.  I come from a very poor third world country where even $500 monthy salary is considered as a high salary. So I'v been seeing posts about many people struggling. I'm struggling myself to a certain extent but I'v managed to keep my head above the water. So i'm sharing some things what we as immigrants from third world country do to survive.

1. First of all, most of us live as groups. Like we share apartments. I live in a house with two other housemates. So the rent and utilities goes three ways and each of us pays around $800 in rent + utilities.

2. We always cook our food. We make batches of food twice a week. I have never cooked in my life before moving to US but now i can cook very well. My other two housemates also can cook. So sometimes we take turns in cooking for the house and sometimes we cook things together. So each of us spends only $100-$150 per month on food.

3. We do not get into credit card trap. when i came to US i only took a credit card and used it only to increase my credit score. My credit score is around 740 so i get credit card offers with 0% interest for 18 months. I had some emergency expenses so now i have a credit card balance of $3000. But since it's a 0% credit card, i only pay $100 a month . When my 0% interest  period ends i get new card with again 0% interest for 18 months and transfer the balance to it.

4. we spend only on absolute neccessities until we have considerable amount in our savings. In my first job in the US, i got paid $60K/yr and my friend got paid $50K/yr. I was working remote so i could work from home. We both pooled in and bought a 2013 corolla for $6000 and shared it and drove it for almost 2 years. we only bought separate vehicles after we both saved around $20K.

5. We are prepared for emergencies and have some backup plans. So i lost my job couple of months back. I kinda knew my job is kind of unstable around the time i was planning to buy a new car. so what i did was i bought a cheap SUV that qualifies for uber XL. It was under $20K and I Put a down payment of $5k so i pay only $350 a month in car payments. So now i drive uber while searching for a new job and since i can take uber XL , I can comfortably make north of $3500 just driving 30 hours a week. all my expenses are around $2700 so i get to save around $800 a month too.(i was saving $1500 a month while i was doing my job) 

6. While living below means we learn new skills and search for opportunities . I think this is the most important thing. Living below means is not  a permenant solution to poverty. We need to get to a level where we do not have to worry about our financials. So learning new skills and finding opportunities should be a top priority. That's the reason why i only drive uber for 30 hours a week just to cover my expenses. All other time, I'm doing online courses and doing projects while applying to new jobs.


So finally the reason why many immigrants can survive in this country is that we were just born on a different level of poverty . So even being poor in The US is also a luxury for us. Don't work hard just work smart. I hope each and everyone who read my post become financialy free within this year.

povertyfinance,first home,"Beggars cant be choosers: I tracked the ""fresh"" fruits and veggies I get from a food charity. Here are the simplified results","I visited a food charity that distributes fresh fruit and veggies to the ~~poors~~ needy once weekly for 7 months. I am extremely grateful that they exist but the system isn't great. Disclaimer: I need food help and I'm thankful AF.

Eggs: I received a dozen eggs on four separate occasions. On 2 separate occasions I got food poisoning because the eggs were not really fresh.

Veggies: I was lucky to get veggies (various) on every visit. Typically veggies dried out, or often mushy. In fact I was able to gently push my finger through a dozen cucumbers as I demonstrated to the staff that the cukes weren't really edible. Tomatoes were available every week but only once did I even take them home, they looked so bad. The ones I took home were pretty good. I often got celery, which was usually good enough to eat.
**In total 55% of veggies that I took home didn't last 24 hours in my fridge before signs of rot occurred.** 

Fruit: I was able to get fruit on every visit. Apples and oranges were usually fresh, albeit sometimes tasteless. Only once were the grapes edible (and actually tasty). 
**In total over the 7 months 61% of fruit was inedible after 24 hours.**

Others: I got some great apple cider from a local farm twice. Heaven. So good that the first time I cried from joy.
Cheese: Once I got a brick of cheddar that was chewy and devoid of flavor. Once I got a slab of something labeled mozzarella that made me sick AF.

Nothing I received, except the cider, was even remotely grocery store quality.

I stopped going after 7 months because I got better odds eating from the local restaurants trash. Only once did I get sick from the trash, which taught me not to go back in the summer.

I'm grateful, truly. For the food, and the incredible kindness of the volunteers. They are beautiful people who don't get thanked enough. It's better than nothing by far.

povertyfinance,first home,Last night,"Last night, me and my boyfriend just laid there starving and meditating and complaining to each other until my check hit at around 1:30am and we rushed to Taco Bell to finally eat something. We live paycheck to paycheck, we both get paid on the same week instead of alternating weeks, so when we run out of money we run out completely and then we both get both of our checks. I get mine on Thursdays and he gets his on Fridays. 

Well anyways. We had a couple of emergencies come up this pay cycle and we ran out of money and food completely. Spent the last little bit of money we had a few days ago on a bag of cat food and cat litter. Cause kitties come first always! We fasted all day yesterday together because we literally had nothing in the house and zero dollars to our name. My check usually posts overnight every other Wednesday so we were sitting there last night refreshing the app constantly like lunatics just waiting for it to post. When it finally did around 1:30am we hopped up and ran to Taco Bell lol. What an amazing feeling. 

We never eat out and just cook at home to save money so it was a nice little treat to be able to get Taco Bell last night. It was an experience for sure and I’ll always remember sitting up all night starving with my babe after we both hadn’t eaten in over 24 hours.

povertyfinance,first home,From empty every month to an actual stock for emergency,I had to start accessing food banks in the last two months. (I realize now that I should have been accessing them long before). The first few I tried were horrible and dehumanizing and they sent me home with spoiled rotten foods that I had to just throw away. Then I discovered a different food bank that gave actually good and edible food. I went last month and went again today. Every month I was living with my cabinets and fridge/freezer empty except for some condiments. I went hungry for days. Which is dangerous with my medical conditions. All I ever had at the end of the month was protein powder to keep me alive. Since accessing the good food bank twice I’ve gone from starving at the end of every month to actually having a bit of backstock in case of an emergency (I.e. my benefits not showing up on time). I am so thankful to the food banks for providing what they can. And I am so thankful to not be in fear of starving at the end of every month anymore. The pictures show the current state of my pantry and fridge/freezer stock (for 2 adults). It’s NEVER looked like this at this point in the month. Over half of the food shown is from food banks.

povertyfinance,first home,My Girlfriend’s Trying to Save for a Car While Working at Starbucks & Covering for Her Deadbeat Dad — Need Advice,"My girlfriend works at Starbucks, putting in about 30 hours a week at $15.25/hr. She’s been trying to save for a car, but her home situation has made that way more difficult than it should be.

She lives with her dad, who was **supposed to be the one paying the $500/month rent to their landlord**. But he hasn’t paid in **three months**, and they’re now behind on rent. Rather than risk eviction or more stress, **she stepped up and decided to just start paying the $500 herself** — even though it was originally his responsibility. She also covers **lot rent** ($3,200/year), **electricity**, **phone**, **medical insurance**, and personal expenses — with no real help from him. He lies constantly, avoids responsibility, and acts more like a dependent than a parent.

On top of that, **she doesn’t have a car**. She spends around **$240/month on Uber** just to get to work and school. If I couldn’t help drive her a few days a week, that number would be **closer to $768/month**.

We’ve built a full budget in a spreadsheet and she’s managing to save **about $290/month** toward a **$2,000 used car**. But it’s hard to stay motivated when you’re constantly cleaning up someone else’s mess at home and fighting to stay afloat.

I’m doing what I can: helping with rides, emotional support, and managing her expenses. But I’d really appreciate advice from people who’ve been through anything similar:

* Are there any programs that help low-income workers get cars or reduce transportation costs?
* Anyone who works at Starbucks — are their benefits (health, education, stock, etc.) actually helpful in practice?
* Any advice for saving and staying sane when you’re stuck with a toxic parent who drags you down?
* How did you afford your first car when you had little to no family support?

She’s genuinely trying to change her life, and I just want to support her however I can. Thanks in advance for any insight or resources 🙏

povertyfinance,down payment savings,My mom passed recently. I'm bout to be homeless at 18. Just need a little advice.,"I hated even typing the title out. I'm kind of still a wreck. My mom had a stroke 2 days after I graduated. They tried to do CPR but couldn't bring her heartbeat back. I was alongside her the whole time. And I just can't even begin where to think why any of this happened. She was very healthy and happy all of the time. Saying it's surreal is so much of an understatement. All of the times I could've spent with her and the more love I could've showed her. It's all gone now. And there's no getting it back. I think I'll always feel like this now. But I managed to focus on daily tasks and try to move on with my life. I always knew I'd eventually lose the house. It's only me here. My dad has never really been in my life. And according to my mom, I haven't seen him since I was 5, I'm an only child. I got a 14-day notice to vacate. 

Idk where to go or what resources are available to people in this situation. I live in Maine, and most of my mom's side of the family lives in Texas. I've been trying to reach out. Hopefully, one of them will let me stay with them. I currently work at Wendy's. But I think I'm going to switch over to a temp agency because they pay more. It hurts staying in the house often, but I don't want to lose it. I feel like I'm letting her down. 

I offered them $300 for a payment, but they want a full payment. Which is a few extra hundred dollars. And I just can't do that right now. I'd have to work another week to have it all. And I still will give it to them if they'd just cut me a break and let me pay the rest later. I'm saving it just in case they change their mind. I'm willing to stay in a woman's shelter for a while if I have to. I just don't know too much about this kind of stuff. And all of this happened so fast. I'm scared and depressed at the same time. And I can barely feed myself. I don't know what I'm doing. My mom also told me she had me in her will, and I don't know the first thing about how to receive it to help pay for the house. I'm just lost, confused, sloppy, and unorganized right now. But I'm trying. Sorry for the long write also, I just needed to get some of it out, I guess.",542,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/1m42dhr/my_mom_passed_recently_im_bout_to_be_homeless_at/,1752947311.0,Expert_Web_4432,1m42dhr,advice_seeking
FirstTimeHomeBuyer,invest $1000,What I've Learned After 6 Months as a FTHB,"Hoping to share some info and tips to other FTHBs - insights I wish I had when I went through the process. I live in SE USA, and my budget was just about average for the market and area. It's been now about six months since closing, and I am very pleased with my new home.

- Buying a home is a *lifestyle choice*. It *can be* a vehicle for investment, but you should not approach homebuying if you're looking to make money. If you see realistic scenarios where you may need to move within the next few years, keep renting. If you can see yourself realistically living in your town/neighborhood for three years or more, most signs point to ""making money"" off the home... but it's likely the next home you'd move to increased in value as well. It's impossible to time the market, and home values seem to almost only go up, up, up. Buy what you can, when you can, but only if you can.

- Timing your lease break is hard. Usually have to pay a penalty. If you want to avoid all that, start your home search process about 90-120 days ahead of time. Most landlords seek 60 days notice. Start to close is about 45 days assuming you find your new home within the first 10ish days.

- Finding the right realtor for you and your needs is critical. There's no shortage of realtors out there. You should visit with at least two or three, but don't be afraid to keep looking until you find a good one. There are a lot of good-to-great realtors, but AMAZING realtors are hard to come by, and wholehearted recommendations from trusted friends and peers speaks volumes. They should be interviewing you as you interview them. They work for you, but a good realtor will want to see that you're not wasting *their* time either. Many (all?) realtors have brokerage agreements that include a lot of crap in it, but most notably a clause that makes you exclusive to them for X number of months. Once you sign that, you HAVE to work with them unless you both agree to terminate the contract. Don't sign anything until you both visit a few homes together to figure out what you like, don't like, your needs, budget. A good realtor will have unique insights on home features, prospective maintenance, things to be mindful of or avoid. A great realtor is (generally) not doing it as a side hustle, and has a big portfolio of clients to show some of their prowess, though it's not all about the number of deals closed. A great realtor will have 3-5 lenders, inspectors, and tradesmen available should you ever ask. They are connected within all things related to home. They work fluidly and make themselves available to you. If you feel comfortable, sign the brokerage agreement. I personally worked with three total. The first was terrible because it was from a weak recommendation, she was new to the industry, and all she did was do a generic search on MLS. My second one was a friend, who unfortunately was a bit too pushy. My ultimate realtor came from a strong friend recommendation. He worked his ass off and made himself available to me at wacky days and hours. He was honest with me and not pushy. Every step of the way made me feel comfortable and confident. When I didn't know something he explained it correctly and in detail, if needed. A good realtor knows the strategies of offering and has contingency plans if/when things go sideways unexpectedly.

- Nothing wrong with using a friend who is a realtor, but I would recommend avoiding mixing business and friendship. Even if the deal goes through, it's a weird transactional dynamic in my opinion. A true friend will understand this - it's not ""awkward"", it's smart.

- Truthfully, the biggest and most decisive steps in the process are with the inspection and lending/financing steps. The inspector SHOULD be ""nit-picky"" and generate a long, detailed list. No house is perfect. They should look at EVERYTHING in detail and be THOROUGH, things you think are excessive and unneccesary. Looking back, I'd probably hire a second inspector from my own independent research. Never hurts to have a second opinion. While the service is a bit costly ($500ish), even a good inspector can help save you from a huge headache and $10,000+ nightmares. A great inspector will be thorough and can explain everything in detail. Keep the report and rank things as immediate, within a year, or long-term. Prioritize projects appropriately and get quotes on things that will require help and fixing. These things can be negotiating chips with the seller.

- Closing sale prices can be deceptive. Deals often have stipulations of offers beside the final transaction price. Leaving appliances or features or seller-paid closing costs don't show up on the final transaction price.

- You need to be fluent and smart with breakeven calculations. So much of the deal is understanding if you want to receive or pay the money NOW or money LATER spread out over time. For example... you can ask for $10,000 seller-paid closing costs NOW when you close. Or you can close at a final transaction price of ~$10,000. The latter savings will not be realized until a later date. Same goes with changing your down payment versus paying PMI.

- Look and see if you can pay 1/2 mortgage payment 2x a month or see if you can afford a 13th payment within the year. These tricks help save on interest down the line and make sense if you plan to live in the home for long time (10+ years).

- You need to trust and be comfortable with you lender just like you are with your realtor. Almost everything I said above applies for lender - they should make themselves available to YOU. Customer service counts for something. They should help you understand your budgeting and payments and be able to explain every fee and cost on the closing sheet in detail. Timing rates is impossible, but a good lender can help pick a good one. Ask for ""one free float"". Everything I experienced and hear is to avoid the ""big banks"". They are slow and bureaucratic. Difficult to work with. Won't turn documents over quickly. All this puts you at a disadvantage when competing against other offers and your overall package to the seller. If you're a seller, you want as few risks and headaches as possible. Big banks are tough to work with. Local lenders or credit unions are hungrier, quicker, leaner, and often more competitive (read: cheaper). Find 2-3 great lenders and pit them in competition with each other to drive out as many fees and costs as possible. Pick the cheapest one with best customer service. There will be a lot of confusing, dumb fees and taxes, but you gotta pay them anyway and they're almost all non-negotiable.

- Appraisal is a bank/lender thing. It can present a challenge, but as long as you and your realtor did you homework, it should be a non-issue. Expectation is the appraised value matches your offer. If it's higher... cool to get the immediate equity, but that's not money you can take to the bank today.

- A lot of the calculations are estimates until after the deal goes through. When dealing with monthly payments and budgeting estimations, assume costs only go up lol. If you're given a range, assume it will be on upper half of range. Things like property taxes are hard to predict, but always assume the worst. Make sure you can afford it.

- Closing - especially your first time - is a whirlwind. Stressful and anxiety-inducing. Everyone else in the room thinks it's routine, and you're a fish out of water. Don't be afraid to ask questions. Read everything as much as you can stomach. There should be no surprises between your realtor and lender preparing you ahead of time. Follow instructions ahead of time. Don't faint when you look at the amortization schedule LOL. Make sure your seller has fully moved out and broom swept the place. Get all keys. Some people have a locksmith ready to go to refit or change locks on Day One. I definitely recommend taking closing day off from work. So much stuff is going to happen, it's impossible to focus on your job that day.

- Highly recommend hiring cleaners between closing/getting keys and moving in. Most cleaners have ""move-in"" packages. It's one less thing you need to worry about, and I didn't find the prices to be all that crazy. I think it was like $350 for a thorough top-to-bottom deep clean including baseboards and appliances.

- Costs begin to become abstract numbers when you realize how much you're shelling out for random things.

- No home is perfect, and a lot of issues the seller won't even know about. Not everyone is malicious or out to get you, but keep an appropriate amount of skepticism on everything. Read everything thoroughly. Ask questions to those you trust. Hopefully the inspector catches some things, but you very well will find a trove of quirks and faults during your first few months. I am fortunate to have a good relationship with the seller, but I understand this is not the norm. She is available if I have random questions about when she last did such and such maintenance or other quirks of the house. It's wise to keep *some* amount of distance, but their insights can be valuable. Some of my friends on both sides of the transaction had to go no contact if things got weird or annoying.

- It's hard to not fall in love with a home during a visit, but try not to. Ask yourself if you feel comfortable and safe and at peace. If you can, visit inside 2-3 total times to get a true sense if it feels real and if the seller is playing any tricks. Poke around... open cabinets, doors, etc.

- It's very likely that your all-in mortgage + other monthly home expenses will exceed what you pay for rent. You need to be OK and modestly flexible with your budgeting. Random stuff will pop up that require tools, materials, or a visit, and can be anywhere from $100-1000 a month depending on what happens. A good realtor and a great lender can and should be honest with you about what you can comfortably afford.

- When touring homes, do not be afraid to ask the seller (reasonable) questions including the age of the major appliances if they are included and exterior plumbing/sewer stuff. Know the general life spans of these things because HVAC and water heater cost A LOT of money, and you may be on the hook for those if they're near the end of life. Try to amend your offer or build up your savings in anticipation. I've been quoted $6-12k for a new water heater install and HVAC install can easily be $20,000+. 

- My place is under 10 years old and a big reason I bought it was because there was very little I felt I needed to fix or renovate, yet there still a mountain of never-ending projects that suck up a lot of my free time. Much is regular home maintenance like caulking and dryer vent cleaning, but it's impossible to predict if/when an appliance will break or you need to patch your drywall after a small leak requires a wall demo. These unforeseen projects will suck up your time and sanity, especially if you're a first timer. Be aware and honest with yourself and abilities on what you can reasonably handle and know that DIY will save you a lot of money. It's absurd to read some of the quotes for labor.

- It's nearly impossible to get labor/trades to come to your home for under $100 a visit. They will always upcharge for services and materials, and truthfully the best way to avoid getting taken advantage of is doing research and asking questions. For any projects over $500, get multiple quotes. Neighborhood or city FB groups can point you to trusty local experts and handymen better than Google can. Have never had good experiences with Taskrabbits, and would highly recommend staying away from that site. The people you can hire are fine, the way the site is run is atrocious and unreliable. Home Depot and Lowe's rent out big and small tools + trucks. Don't rush to buy random big ticket items.

- When it comes to tools and materials, don't cheap out unless you know exactly what you need. Don't buy the most expensive either. Kobalt and Craftsman are fine if it's something you use 1-5 times a year. You can likely buy Harbor Freight or entry level tools to start and if they break, then buy an expensive, quality replacement. Same for materials... a cheap Valspar paintbrush will make your paint jobs look like shit, while a Purdy brush for $5-10 more will look a lot better. 

- Speaking of painting, painting is the best ratio of money saved to to expertise and time needed. It's definitely a pain in the ass, but it's one thing you would be foolish to outsource unless you have to. I got a quote of about $8000 to paint only the walls of a 1600 sqft house - not including the ceilings or trim! I knocked out ceilings, trim, and walls myself over about three weeks and probably $400 of materials.

- Familiarize yourself as much as you can ahead of time with the basics of drywall repair, landscaping and lawncare, painting, plumbing, electrical, HVAC, yearly regular home maintenance stuff, etc. If this stresses you out or you have low curiosity & interest, you better be willing to pay a LOT of money for people to do it for you. You will need a constant DIY spirit and willingness to both learn every day and be incredibly humbled nearly every step of the way. You will likely get burnt out amongst the never-ending list of things to do, but need to persevere and keep a level head. If handling pests or bugs or cleaning out P traps and dislodging caked on grime and grase from pipes freaks you out, maybe renting is for you.

- Make a calendar on your iCal or Google Calendar specific for home maintenance reminders. You will get a notification to check your CO/smoke detectors or clean your dryer vents. No more guessing or forgetting.

- The adage seems to be that everything you think that will be easy is hard and everything that will be hard is easy. Take however long you think a project will take and triple it for a good realistic estimate. It's not so much the main task, but the initial research, buying the right tools and materials, prep and set up, and then clean up at the end. Add a few embarrassing visits to Lowe's into your calculation as well.

- Homes generally bigger than apartments. You will feel small in a big home. Don't feel like you need to buy and decorate ASAP just to fill the place out. Buy the right things, not the quick things when it comes to decor and furniture.

- My opinion is that the ""Smart Home"" and ""Home Security"" space is absolutely fucked right now. So many big name companies were pivoting hard 5-10 years ago into that market, and the market is contracting massively. Today, the ecosystems are confusing, products are pared back or dysfunctional, and finding the right product is hard because names and products are constantly changing over the last few years. Smart home devices like doorbells and cameras are separate from home security offerings, but some companies offer both. The Ring products today are totally different in name and capability than the ones from 3 years ago. The plans are confusing. I personally strongly recommend avoiding Google after watching them fumble Nest integration and their history of dropping support. Avoid ADT. I went Ring for security and cameras, and I am very pleased. If you're willing to spend money, then go for local, independent home security companies. I went with Ecobee based on Consumer Reports and Wirecutter reviews... also pleased.

- Pay attention to stairs and getting in/out of your home. If you're not the most mobile and you have three sets of stairs from your garage to your bedroom, I can assure you that you will get annoyed and tired of walking up those same damn steps dozens of times a day. This logic extends to getting in/out of your neighborhood and home when it comes to driving, commuting, walkability, going for a bike ride... If you're at the bottom of a hill and you like to bike ride, just know every ride will start with a tiring climb. If you live right off a busy street, not only will the noise be something to deal with, but also getting out and about will be a chore. If you have 10 stop signs and speeds bumps before you can get to a main throughway or an annoying stop light that takes two minutes to change to green ... keep it all in mind. It's likely not make-or-break, but it can be a tedious annoyance.

- The only major issue I have had is living next to a Neighbor From Hell. I thought I knew this area well, and picked it because it was quiet, yet here I am dumbfounded and surprised why this asshole and his friends terrorize my community so much. I made a few quick visits to check out the property and area outside of tours and visits, but missed this. Same goes for what street or neighborhood you're on, I highly, highly recommend checking it alllllllllllll out as much as you can tolerate ahead of time before the due diligence ends, even if it means camping out in your car for a few hours at day and night. Whatever assumptions you make can easily prove wrong, unfortunately.

- People rag on HOAs. You tend to only hear from the disgruntled residents, while most people think their HOA is ""fine"". Overzealous HOAs are obviously bad. In my opinion, a lax, hands-off HOA with little teeth and support is just as bad. My understanding is the HOA character is heavily dependent on the people who volunteer to run it. Don't be afraid to ask questions about the bylaws, rules, and financial disclosures/health of the HOA. Think of them as small community-supported LLC businesses. You may be able to have a quick virtual or sit-down meeting with the HOA board to ask questions, and I recommend taking that opportunity. You want them to be organized, supported, and financially healthy. Ask about upcoming and past projects and maintenance. Understand what they will and will not cover with your dues. Just assume a portion of your neighbors are apathetic and shitty people who have zero regard for anyone but themselves. It sucks.
Take it from me and my neighbor issue above, a hands-off HOA can be a huge pain in the ass. Fortunately, the HOA is protecting me and my neighbors by having rules and processes in place to fix the bad actors. If I didn't have an HOA, we would be SOL. In that regard, I am happy with my HOA. Some HOAs cover maintenance and utilities, which is nice. Even assuming maintenance and liability for roads, lawn, and sewer can save you thousands in the event something bad happens.

The general consensus is that it is overpriced and not worth it. Overwhelming about of negative factors that outweigh the positive ones. I was having FOMO over this housing market.

Hi Reddit! 
I am hoping to find some advice on here because I am at a loss. 


We are first time home buyers. My husband is going back to school and wont be working. I make just over $100k and we were preapproved for a $500k mortgage. 

My husband doesnt want this house because its an iffy investment. I think it could be good and comfortable for what we need right now. 


We currently rent a 936 sq ft house close to the  North cascades in WA state. 
We have lived here for 2 years. It's been good. No huge issues. A little loud but overall okay 

We can hear/slightly see the free way in the front. I can hear it right now as I write this on my couch. But we have good freeway access. 

We have a railroad maybe 1000 ft behind us and the trains shake the house. Loud but the house was built in 1916 and has settled just fine.

 
And to our right is a meat packing plant. It is not a slaughter house, just packaging. Odd smells have happened twice in 2 years so smell isnt too much an issue. 
We share a chain link fence with their parking lot. No issues with the workers other than litter blowing over. 


Its a lower/medium income neighborhood with houses selling for  around $355k -$450k. Its a high demand area. 
Anything comparable to what we have is like $410k or more but thats without the meat packing plant. 

There are some half way houses around the neighborhood about 4 blocks away. And a trailer park. But everyone has been kind and respectful and keeps their yards looking nice. 

So the problemo. Our landlord wants us to buy it and is offering $380k with no room to negotiate. Or we move. 

We had the house inspected and its in generally good repair. No structural issues, no abspesos, okay plumbing and electrical. 

We are also a 10 minute walk from downtown. 

But it isnt fancy. We are trying to set ourselves up for success here but the market is scarce. 

We have been looking at other houses but having a yard and a garage is $40k more expensive. Or the house is trashed. 

Would anyone have an opinion on whether or not to jump for this house as a first time home buyer? 

Thank you

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,invest $1000,Moneypit or do I have cold feet?,"We got our inspection results back and today is the last day to submit earnest money, requests are due to the attorney by tomorrow. Need advice on if I’m being overly-analytical or realistic. We’ve been looking for houses under what we can afford so we can save up to build in the next 10-ish years or buy a forever home already built. 

I did the math for this, and altogether our wants and needs for this house would take up the equivalent of most of our excess income (what we save after bills, hobbies, etc) for >2 years if paid in cash as it comes in. This is without putting money into liquid savings, new fixtures, etc. If we put some of the pressing stuff on cards, I’m really afraid of getting in the hole. Some things (like the main part of the roof) can be replaced in 10 years if repaired now based on inspector feedback, and some I wouldn’t want to live there without doing (finishing basement to seal crawlspace - so many spiders). I use non-urgent to indicate it can wait a year or more.

I love the location, and it checks a box of ours that hasn’t been met yet (18x18-ish or larger living room accessible by less than half a flight of stairs for comfortably seating folks at family gatherings) at <$400k. This is a toooough ask in the northern suburbs of Chicago, esp needing 2 offices and a guest bedroom or space to put a guest bedroom (basement).

My father (architect) and mother (worked in real estate in the 70s) are wholly against it- they think everything is overpriced right now, it’s not worth the money, needs too many repairs, and we’ll find something better soon. They were convinced prices would eventually return to “normal” until recently and don’t invest in anything other than CDs as they’re risk-averse. They also suggested we should pay more and get something turnkey-ish. I don’t want to get trapped somewhere that was never meant to be permanent. 

I think passing on the house is a gamble because we may only encounter worse ones, and I don’t mind a bit of elbow grease. We just can’t really do anything about the cost of materials or flat permit fee of 5000k for windows, roof replacement, etc. Would be doing basement unpermitted with family tradesmen (prev. Licensed, then they moved abroad) and ourselves. ",0,https://i.redd.it/gb6l44vzwvpe1.jpeg,1742493902.0,InNeedofBoops,1jfv9jb,advice_seeking

The townhome is  in Florida where I live, it's in a quiet city that is conveniently located about 45 minutes from disney, downtown orlando, universal, etc. It's priced in the mid 300's, 3 bed 2.5 bath, 2 car garage, 1700 square ft., and it's new construction. 

  
 I would be living there with myself and my girlfriend, who would pay me roughly half the mortgage. So far it's looking like my total monthly payment would be about 2500 a month. I make about $3600-$4000 a month, (about 60k a year). I've calculated that after my mortgage and other bills, groceries, memberships, etc. came out, with my girlfriend helping me with the mortgage, i'd have roughly $1000 dollars left over at the end of the month to spend on investments, entertainment, or what ever else is needed. Do you guys think  the mortgage and bills would be taking up too much of my income?

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,invest $1000,Is 2k/month for a house too much making 50k/year? ,"Hi all,

I'm (27m) trying to decide if it is too risky to take on a 1500/month 30 year mortgage, with total housing costs closer to 2k/month including insurance, tax, and 1% for potential repairs. It's 2 bed/2 bath and I intend on getting a roommate and charging them 800-1000 per month to make this much more doable. I take home around 3400/month, and have no other debt. I have 30k in liquid savings and could put 3% down plus fees and still have 15k cash left over, which is about 5 months of living expenses including this new mortgage.

Edit: I have been pre-approved by a private (familial) lender for this, which is part of the reason I want to do this now while the offer stands. 

With a roommate the situation seems reasonable (debt to income around 40%), but if I go a few months without one my debt to income ratio will be close to 60%. I live frugally, I don't have any monthly payments besides Spotify and my main hobbies cost me less than 200/month. My biggest expense is probably hanging out with my girlfriend who will hopefully be a good long term investment /s. If sh\*t really hit the fan I could move back in with my parents (live close by) while I get back on my feet and try to rent the whole house out during that period.

Does this sound overly risky? I'm planning on living in the area for a few years, and I want to try to hold on to the property as a rental if I decide to move somewhere new. I don't mind renting a cheap apartment somewhere else in the country and having to put a few hundred dollars into the rental every month if it's not cash flowing.

TLDR: Should I buy a house for 2k/month, making 3400 per month, with the intention of getting a roommate. I have no other debt or significant monthly payments.

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,invest $1000,Should I even consider getting a house?,"I’ve been living in the Orlando area for the last four years with my friend and rent has gotten to the point where the average 2 bed apartment is easily $800-1000 per person a month on the cheaper end.  In theory, would a mortgage be cheaper in the long run?  I did a (very) cursory search on Zillow at the lower end and found some places where the example mortgage, insurance, utilities and taxes would come out to under $1800 a month.  
That said everyone always says don’t buy a house if you can’t afford one on your own salary (I can’t).  And that’s not including the many fees I’m sure I’m forgetting.  I’m worried if I’ve been brainwashed by the American ideal of homeownership or is it actually a  worthwhile investment for my future.

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,invest $1000,"Considering new build in Laveen, Phoenix AZ","Hello all, me and my partner have been wanting to be homeowners for years and we have worked and saved up for it. We currently live in Ahwatukee and notice that the new builds are offering the most bang for the buck, we can get a brand new home being offered at a 4.5% bought down interest rate and the new home builder will pay to help break our lease, we love our apartment complex, the area and management, we have no real complaints, the rent is very affordable as well. 

I work in East Mesa and she works in Tolleson. It's a 5 bedroom 3 bathroom house and has a guest suite with a seperate entrance and kitchenette for 490k, we are planning to travel for work to see the US in the upcoming years as I'm a union electrician and we don't know what our long term plans are, we originally planned for Oregon or Washington state, but due to family and friends we will likely be here long term. 

We make currently 180k combined and plan to rent out the guest suite for atleast 1000. The PITI is 3060 a month. We really love the home. 

The Laveen area we arent too familiar with, the house will be are genuine home and we will view it as an investment and rent out the guest suite, and we will be leaving the familiar and convenient Ahwatukee area to go there, my partner she does work in Tolleson so she's decently familiar with the area. 

Any comparable home in our area is very old and we would get much less home for something that is risky, as repairs and less efficency for the heating and cooling come into play.. 

Anyone familiar with the Laveen area? Is it worth to step into homeownership in this regard from a financial viewpoint? We would go from 1650 a month to 3060, no debt, DINKs, no kids, take home around 10000.

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,invest $1000,Keep renting or go in and buy?,"Hi everyone,
I’m currently debating whether I should keep renting or sacrifice some of the extra income I have to invest in a house. I live in San Diego so everything is super expensive. I make around 120k a year right now and could probably put down around $20k. I’ve done some calculations and some condos nearby around around $450k and including mortgage insurance, home insurance, tax, etc. it says it will be around $4k a month including most of the $400 month HOA fees. I live with my girlfriend and depending on if we buy it together or not I would have another $750-$1000 a month to help pay for the mortgage as we both rent right now. Renting for a 2 bed is around $2500-2800 and I work from home so I like to have an office. I know the market is crazy right now but do you think it’s worth it or keep my head down for a few years and have a bigger down payment?

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,invest $1000,Need your advice on house budget in MA,"Hi,
My wife and I are looking for our first home and we're seeking some experienced advice on how much we can realistically afford in the Canton/Sharon, MA area (or surrounding towns with good schools.) We're looking for a 3-4 bedroom home, as we have one child and another on the way.
Our Finances:
 * My Income:
   * Base Salary: $110,000/year
   * Commission: $40,000 - $80,000/year (variable)
   * Car Allowance: $950/month
   * Phone Allowance: $85/month
   * Company Gas Card (covers all gas expenses)
 * Wife's Income:
   * Base Salary: $155,000/year
   * Discretionary Bonus: 20% of base salary
   * RSUs (Restricted Stock Units - amount varies annually)

So a combined total of somewhere between $355,000 to $415,000 is likely.
 * Debt:
   * Car Loan: $900/month (only debt)
   * No student debt or medical debt.
 * Cash Savings:
   * $110,000
 * Location:
   * Canton, MA, Sharon, MA, or surrounding towns with excellent school systems.
 * Retirement: We combined roughly $350,000 in a mix of 401k/Roth 401k.

Estimated Monthly Expenses (Guesstimates for some):
 * Car Loan: $900
 * Groceries: $1,200
 * Childcare/Activities: $1,800
 * Utilities (estimate): $400
 * Insurance (car, life, health, home): $500
 * Entertainment/Dining Out: $500
 * Internet/Streaming: $200
 * Clothing/Personal care: $300
 * Savings/Investments: We max our 401ks, and save $200 per month into a 529 plan.
 * Travel/Vacations: $1000 (includes at least one international trip, and several weekend local trips.)
 * Memberships/Subscriptions: $100
 * Miscellaneous: $400
Please note these monthly expenses are rough estimates, and I do not have exact figures.

Key Questions:

 * Given our income and expenses, what's a realistic range for a home purchase price?
 * What range should we aim to spend on a mortgage (including property taxes and insurance)?

Any insights, advice, or personal experiences from those familiar with the area would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks!

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,small windfall,Selling After 1 Year,"We bought our first flat in October in the UK. It's a pretty small 2 bed, but we thought it would be amazing to get on the property ladder and build equity. We've been paying more than 2x the mortgage payment every month since it's been dramatically cheaper than renting. However, we've recently come into a windfall that could mean we can afford our long term family home around October of this year. We're quite keen to move and settle. Nothing inherently wrong with our current place, it's just a bit small. The kitchen is part way through a remodel, but it wasn't too expensive. Hopefully that increases the value, but I'm happy if we just break even. 

Is it possible to sell after only 1 year, and is there anything we should be aware of for doing something like this? ",4,https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/comments/1jbyuyu/selling_after_1_year/,1742055917.0,Prestigious_Pen13,1jbyuyu,advice_seeking
FirstTimeHomeBuyer,small windfall,"Maximizing a sudden windfall, avoiding a very expensive mortgage?","(I'm in New Zealand and I'm aware a lot of the advice here may be USA-specific, but a lot of it won't be so I thought I'd still give it a try!)

My grandmother sadly passed away a few weeks ago and I've been informed I'll be getting a really unexpected inheritance from her. My wife and I have been living like monks to try and save up for a place. We pay around $400 NZD per week in rent. We've got probably $30,000 New Zealand dollars saved up, and the inheritance will add another $150,000 NZD. Suddenly we're looking at having 180k to put on a house! 

We also live in maybe NZ's most expensive city. Moving isn't really an option; we could look at the fringes of the city and rely on public transport but I don't know if getting a vehicle will be sustainable for us financially so we can't get much farther than that. 1-2 bedroom apartments can sell for $500k+ and standalone houses are worse (though it's hard to gauge how much worse as a lot of the recent stuff on the market is enormous family homes we wouldn't be moving into anyway). 

Obviously we can now put a nice down payment on a decent amount of small homes, but my real concern is not ending up with a mortgage that is WAY more than what we're currently paying in rent. If I wanted to buy a $900k house (God I hope I don't have to buy a $900k house), even with a 20% down payment, and with a 5.69% interest rate, we'd suddenly have to pay $960 a week. I could probably live with moving into a studio apartment if we have to, but I'm quite scared I'd hate it, or body corp fees would end up being really expensive, or we wouldn't be able to find somewhere that will let us move in with our two cats... basically I'm just trying to figure out how to turn this money into BETTER quality of life, not worse. 

I know this isn't something I have to figure out right now, but is it something anyone else has had to deal with? How did you handle the transition financially from renting to owning? Did it pay off? Am I better off waiting another few years until we have 200k or even more?

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,what to do with extra money,I’ve renovated 100+ kitchens. Here’s what I’d never do in my own FTH...,"I’ve seen enough contractor horror stories to last a lifetime. Some were mine. I still wake up at three in the morning replaying the clunk of a brand-new fridge jamming halfway into a niche because the manufacturer changed the hinge spec after we framed the opening. Take the following as hard won advice from a guy who has stripped more subway tile than most people have ordered takeout. Disclaimer; NYC (and a bit of LI and NJ) are not the rest of the country...



OPEN CONCEPT IS NOT A MAGIC WAND

Early in the last decade every real estate listing screamed about sightlines. People tore out perfectly good partition walls so the living room and the galley could be one big party zone. Flash forward and the regret emails now fill my inbox. The smell from searing steak drifts straight to the hallway. Remote workers hate staring at crusty pots during Zoom calls. Parents discover there is nowhere to park a stroller that is not in the traffic path between island and fridge.

Last spring I gutted a prewar co-op off Eastern Parkway. The owner wanted an eleven foot island because the glossy magazine she handed me said islands create family togetherness. We warned her that the depth would shrink the only dining area to a glorified ledge. She insisted. Six months later she asked what it would cost to shorten the slab. The stroller for her newborn had nowhere to park and the dog kept knocking plates off the edges. Total reversal cost after demo, new stone, and touch up permits: fifteen thousand dollars.

Reality checks before you swing a hammer

1. Count the linear feet of upper storage you are about to lose. If the number is over twelve you will miss it.
2. Price out a true vented hood. Recirculating units push greasy air right back at your face. If the building cannot accept a new chase you need to keep one wall for a duct.
3. Confirm noise level for that hood in sones. Anything higher than six will make conversation feel like you live next to the F train.
4. Sketch future furniture on a scaled plan. Most New York apartments will not fit both a monster island and a family size dining table unless one of them goes in the bedroom.



THE BUDGET KITCHEN THAT ENDS UP COSTING MORE

Labor is the heavyweight cost in this city. My lead carpenter runs forty five dollars every fifteen minutes. A licensed plumber costs more than a decent steak dinner each hour. When homeowners strip quality out of materials they often pay for it with double labor, because cheap cabinets fight the installer every step of the way.

Story time. A Bed Stuy flipper ordered unbranded shaker doors from an overseas distributor to save three thousand dollars. The doors arrived wrapped in thin foam with half the corners dented. None of the hinge holes lined up with the cabinet frames. My crew burned two extra days tweaking alignment, the buyer still hated the look, and in the end we swapped the fronts for semi custom ones. Net extra cost: six thousand dollars plus a blown sale deadline.

Checklist before you hand over the credit card

1. Ask for a spec sheet that shows plywood thickness. If you see five eighths inch or less you will see sag under weight.
2. Demand Blum or Grass hinges on the quote. Off brand hardware dies early and leaves screw holes too wallowed out for replacements.
3. Get lead time in writing and pad ten business days. Small shops miss dates the same way the subway misses schedules.
4. Reserve ten percent of budget for contingency and do not touch it until the final walk through. It will disappear into things you cannot see today.



APPLIANCE SPECS THAT RUIN TIMELINES

Appliance delays are the silent killers of renovation momentum. The day after drywall prime a delivery team is supposed to roll in a stove and fridge so the cabinet maker can measure final panels. When that shipment misses by a week the entire job gridlocks. Electricians cannot pull final circuits. Countertops cannot be templated. Painters hover waiting for touch ups.

Last winter a Nolita condo owner fell in love with a twenty four inch European washer dryer combo she saw on Instagram. No American distributor carried stock, but a website promised late February delivery. Customs held the container six extra weeks. We resequenced trades, paid overtime, built a temporary plywood door so the rest of the apartment could move forward, and still lost almost two months. The owner paid rent on a sublet the whole time.

Rules I follow in my own house

1. Never order an appliance that does not publish a US service number. Parts on a boat add wild cards to your schedule.
2. Confirm in writing that gas regulators, trim kits, and anti tip brackets come with the unit. I have had ConEd shut down a building because a plumber (that my client insisted on bringing in) tried to reuse an old regulator that could not handle modern BTU loads.
3. Get physical clearance diagrams before framing. A quarter inch error at rough in turns into a full day of patching when the fridge fouls the pantry door.
4. Check total amp draw for the whole kitchen. Prewar apartments often live on sixty amp panels. An induction cooktop can eat half of that by itself. Factor in a service upgrade before walls close.



TIMELINE REALITY FOR NYC KITCHENS

Numbers below assume no landmark review and a cooperative board that meets monthly. Condos can be slower. Townhouses/SFHs can move faster with proper planning.

1. Design development with your architect or designer... eight to ten weeks.
2. Building management review... two to six weeks. Holidays stall this more than anything.
3. Department of Buildings permit turnaround for an Alteration Type II... four to eight weeks if drawings are clean.
4. Cabinet fabrication... six to twelve weeks after final field measure.
5. On site construction... six to nine weeks if every delivery hits the date.

Add them up. That flashy television show that demolishes on Monday and hosts brunch on day forty five forgot to show the three months of paperwork that happened off screen.



HIDDEN COSTS THAT SLAUGHTER SPREADSHEETS

I keep this list on my phone because I quote these curveballs weekly.

1. Asbestos vinyl under old linoleum. Lab results in seventy two hours. Abatement plan adds one week and three to five thousand dollars for a typical 800sq ft apt.
2. Electrical surprises when the super discovers knob and tube wiring behind plaster. Time hit one week. Cost hit roughly ninety five dollars per outlet replaced which adds up fast in a galley loaded with appliances.
3. Extra layers of fire rated board when a neighbor above complains about sound transfer. Time hit three days. Cost hit two thousand in materials and labor. Also re: typical 800sq ft apt
4. Board mandated $2million+ dollar liability insurance certificates for every subcontractor. Nobody tells you about this during the walk through. Expect premiums or day rates to rise the moment the requirement appears.

THINGS I ALWAYS DO

A short list to end on a positive note.

1. Pull permits even when the building claims the work is cosmetic. **Inspectors keep a crew honest**. Penalties for sidestepping are uglier than the permit fee.
2. Install LED under cabinet lighting on a dimmer. It costs lunch money and sells lifestyle during resale.
3. Oversize pullout trash and recycling. Skipping daily hallway trips extends marital harmony.
4. Keep a full height broom closet even in the tightest galley. Real life needs somewhere to hide the vacuum and dog food.
5. Seal all stone on day of install and again thirty days later. The second coat is the one that stops red wine from becoming a tattoo.
6. Use soft and indirect lighting everywhere (except for task lighting in kitchen, or a workshop). I can write a book on this one.

FINAL THOUGHT

Every renovation is a math problem. Money plus space plus time equals finished kitchen. A good contractor shows you the numbers before you sign. If someone waves away your questions with trust me they are gambling with your savings. I learned that lesson early in my career when a cabinet shop went bankrupt midway through a job and I had to front ten thousand dollars of my own to keep the client from suing. I decided then my bids would read like a short novel.

26/F Seeking advice… maybe even just anxious to see the first mortgage on my first house come out of my account. 

I hate it. 
I got into a situation… I’ll summarize and paraphrase a bit. So I saved up some money, put an offer on a house. House goes to sheriff sale. House is AS-IS. No refunds. 
The lender I was talking to reassured me it was USDA qualified. Gave them 15k cash. No. It wasn’t. They also sold a house that wasn’t able to be sold due to a lien<?. 
Skip jump 9 months — a whole pregnancy might I add (time relation, I didn’t give birth). 
+ an extra 25k JUST to close. I worked my ass off to make it. 
I was originally quoted 3k. I’ve run short on funds. I work everyday, really hard and I am in a cash business so I’ll barter and trade, and be able to make things work.. I make decent money for being without a college education… 

Before im too deep though… should I just sell the house? I know i probably could get what I paid for it and I am okay knowing I helped a family with getting those carpets out 😅😂 but in all honesty…. I don’t know what im doing and I didn’t think this would be as big of an issue 🫤 I don’t want to live in the house unless it’s fixed enough to the point where I feel safe having my daughter there.

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,what to do with extra money,"Finally got one after being outbid 6 times. $490k, $25k down, 6.99% fixed conventional","For anyone who gets annoyed at success posts with no context, here’s our story with numbers and what we learned.

TL;DR — First Time Homebuyers in Utah
- Home price: $490k
- Fixed Rate: 6.99%
- Offer: $490k + closing costs + solar paid by seller
- Earnest Money: $4k
- Down payment: $25k (just enough to go conventional and keep the rest of our savings for rainy days)
- Monthly mortgage (incl. PMI/taxes): $3,529
- Appraised value: $491.5k
- Location: SLC
- My income: $115k (Software Dev, 2.5 YOE)
- Her income: $80k (RN, almost 1 YOE)
- Credit scores: 730s (me), 700s (her)

Me (26M) and my girlfriend (26F) were tired of renting and decided to try and buy a home. We found a random realtor through Zillow when we scheduled our first showing, we stuck with her because she was great.

I found our mortgage broker through my city’s subreddit funny enough. I called him to see if he’d be down to work with me, and he asked a couple questions about our offer strategy and pre-approval. I gave some half-baked answers since I didn’t really know what I was doing yet — and he spent an hour and a half on the phone explaining the whole process from start to finish… on a Sunday. That’s when I knew I wanted to stick with him.

We spent a month house hunting and lost 5 bidding wars. We tried different tactics (like waiving the inspection contingency once), but money talks. Utah’s apparently the 2nd fastest-growing state behind Idaho, and it shows — the market’s brutal.

We finally got an offer accepted after going $20k over asking. Then we backed out after the inspection showed foundation issues, roof problems, damaged siding, etc. That inspection cost me $1,025 since I added a sewer scope and radon test. I showed my dad the report and he was annoyed I didn’t have him look at the house first — said he would've told me not to touch it unless it was $100k under asking. So yeah, that $1,025 went down the drain. Honestly made me question if we should keep going.

A week or two later, we saw a new listing go up because the sellers were getting divorced. We happened to be the first ones to tour it, brought my dad along this time, and put in an offer that same day. We offered $490k (asking price), asked for closing costs to be covered, and also had them pay off the brand new solar panels they’d just installed. They accepted immediately — no bidding war this time.

My dad said we didn’t need to inspect it this time, but I did it anyway just for peace of mind. That one cost $325. Turns out, my dad was right and the report came back clean. The sellers had only owned the place for 16 months, already fixed up all the issues from their inspection, redid the floors, garage, sink, appliances, etc. — and added solar.

I paid $515 for the appraisal and it came in at $491.5k, so we’re starting off with a little equity. We also ran the numbers with our broker and decided not to buy down any points since we don’t plan on staying more than 3–5 years, we wouldn't get our money's worth.

Biggest takeaway:
Work with people who aren’t just trying to rush a deal or squeeze out every last buck they can. I don’t think most loan officers are picking up on a Sunday and walking you through the whole process before you even commit to working with them. Same with our realtor — I originally wanted to offer asking, but she pushed for $480k and closing costs covered. I felt it was a little unethical to take advantage of this couple going through some perosonal turmoil, so we met in the middle at $490k with the extras, and it worked out. A lot of agents wouldn’t bother pushing to save as much as they can for their clients.

Happy to answer questions if you're going through it. The process sucked at times, but I’m glad we stuck it out.

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,what to do with extra money,Is this too high of a mortgage?,"Hi all! My husband and I are so excited because we found the home we want to build. It’s with Pulte, the neighborhood is perfect, HOA is $74 a month, amazing schools, and it’s a big enough house for us to have kids as well as my mother in law and my brother to move in. We walked through the model, we priced everything and added all of the fixins’, the total cost was right at what we were approved for, but then he gave us the monthly payment-$4100 a month. Ouch. My husband swears we can do it since my mother in law and brother will be living with us, but I get very anxious because I don’t want us to be house poor. We need a larger house so that our family can grow and for the family who will already be living with us, but I don’t want to count on money from my brother (the plan is for him to pay $500 a month) or mother in law (she’s already paying the down payment). Unfortunately this area is expensive, and the resales are the same price or more. We take home together $9400 a month. My husband was so sad when I said we need to get rid of the extras (like the extended living room and a sunroom), because those extend the basement out. It’s a 3000 square foot house with everything, it would drop to about 2800 square feet which is still a great size. Additionally, we could always add a sunroom later, just without the basement extension. My husband thinks that because we have great careers (nurse practitioner and software engineer) that we can do the higher cost up front and it will get better later. I’m not sure. Our realtor is going to talk with us about it today (3rd party family realtor who gives it to us straight, we love her!). On top of it, we plan on trying for kids next year. So for everyone, is $4100 a month too high for us? Thank you so much! 

EDIT: Our realtor worked so darn hard, she got the monthly payment down to $3850 a month. She’s awesome, but my husband and I discussed a lot and decided we don’t want to have such a steep payment. The property taxes in the area are very high, and we would have to spend more money for a locked interest rate. 
We really don’t want to exceed $3500 a month, that being our absolute highest. Like I told a lot of you, we don’t want to depend on my brother or MIL for rent or anything like that. We want to be able to pay for it completely on our own. My MIL paying the down payment is amazing, but we found out she was planning to spend every penny she has! I am so happy that came up at our meeting today! We said absolutely not, she can give $5,000 to help if she really wants and we will handle the rest. Thank you guys for the amazing advice!!! I wish we could buy my MIL her own house-she has done so much for us over the years, it would be the least we could do. Maybe we can save more and get a home with an in law suite or get enough land that we can build a tiny home for her 🤣 either way, thank you so much for your help!

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,what to do with extra money,Got the keys and moved in/ Advice to others,"Hello everyone! I got the keys to my house on Tuesday of last week and am officially all moved in! After the crap show that is the first week of living in a home, I did want to jump on here and give some general advice  because home ownership has had some weird first steps for me that I didn't account for and I would love to share so others are more prepared!

This is all pretty straight forward, and may be a bit obvious, but I didn't think about them when I was closing and I wish I had thought to ask. 

1. In your expenses that you're accounting for set aside an extra $100. This isn't for closing, it's for the random things that come up. For example: I had to replace my HVAC filter, smoke alarm batteries and one of the locks I bought didn't have the right screws in the kit so I had to buy new ones. You have no idea what your stepping it on for the most random things so have that money set aside as a just in case!

2. Tape the bottom of your boxes when you're moving! Seriously, make sure you do it or you will regret it. 

3. Be mindful of your locks: the previous owners of my house have a doorknob that automotically locks itself and I did not know that. I got locked out my first day of living in my house and didn't have my keys. Test your locks and see if they lock themselves or need replacing all together. 

4. When buying locks be prepared: they are way more expensive then you think. It's kinda ridiculous. I spent $110 on just locks. 

5. Find your breaker box and get aquatinted with it. My house has a fun quirk where I have to flip the breaker once in a while when the HVAC gets too cold. Like to have never found the breaker box and wish I had done that earlier. 

6. Before closing ask where the hot water heater is, the breaker box, the water shut off etc... once you close you usually can't ask any of those questions. 

7. Be prepared to find weird quirks in your house or small repairs that need done. No house is perfect and don't let it discourage you. 

8. Be prepared to feel overwhelmed and like you made a massive mistake buying a house. You didn't, you're just stressed and tired, it will feel better once the boxes are unpacked and you figure out where everything is. 

9. Your neighbors may be super weird. 

10. Buyers regret is a thing you may feel and it will pass. Just remember the journey it took to get into your home. 

11. Last one: you won't know everything is a sure thing with closing until after you sign the papers. It will be stressful and annoying, but it's normal. Try to get a closing appointment first thing in the morning so it's less stressful.

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,what to do with extra money,Looking for advice—should I go all in to buy my family's house before it hits the market?,"Just want to start off my saying I would really appreciate some advice. I keep trying to call the Dave Ramsey show haha but its hard to get through and time is ticking.

I'm 33, born and raised in San Diego, and I’ve been trying to buy a home here since 2019. I had a solid savings plan, but once the pandemic hit, I got priced out. It’s been tough feeling like I “missed my shot,” especially after sacrificing so much to save.

My grandmother passed and left her house to her three kids (my mom and two uncles). It’s a 2,000+ sq ft single-family home in a decent SD neighborhood, with a yard and garage. Super outdated (think carpet in the kitchen) but it’s livable, and my close friend in construction is willing to help me fix it up.

It appraised at $820K, but they plan to list it at $750K due to the condition. The inspection found $6K in termite damage and some ventilation issues, but the foundation is solid. I’ve loved this house since I was a kid and would be proud to make it my home.

# My current financial situation:

* **Income:** $60/hour averaging 32 hours a week
* **Gross Annual Income:** $97,000
* **Take-home Pay (after taxes and 3% 401(k) match):** $6000/month
* **Savings:**
   * $195,000 in a money market account (for the down payment)
   * $30,000 in a Fidelity account (emergency fund)
   * $111,000 in a Traditional IRA
   * $27,000 in a Roth IRA
   * $9,180 in my work 401(k)
   * $11,000 in my Chase savings account
* **Debt:**
   * $918 left on a car loan (0% interest)
   * No other debt
   * Currently paying $1600 for rent ($3200 total/split with my BF)

**Here’s my situation:**

* I’m preapproved for a $500K loan with current interest rates & 796 credit score
* I have $200K saved for a down payment
* That puts me at $700K, which isn’t quite enough

My mom isn’t open to a gift of equity—even tho I offered to pay her back later—because she has debt and wants her share of the inheritance now. I have no other family to help with money.

I could bridge the gap by using a $30K emergency fund & pulling from my Roth IRA which is penalty-free to offer the full $750K upfront.    (Sounds stupid but money comes back, I'm not sure if this opportunity to own a home in SD for this low will)

But once they list it, I fear a bidding war. If someone offers $800K+, I’m out. The family realtor says they’re listing it to be “fair” and have backup options, but I worry this is just about squeezing out every dollar.

**I’m torn:** do I stretch myself now to make this happen? This might be my only shot to own a big home in SD I actually love. ***I’d live there with my boyfriend of 4 yrs who'd pay $2K a month to help.  Yes, if things didn’t work out, I have 2 extra rooms I could always rent out.***

Am I being smart and brave—or reckless and emotional? I know they don’t owe me the house, but part of me wants to say: Is splitting a little extra cash three ways really more life-changing than what this home would mean for me long term?

Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you guys again.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/comments/1mgs68l/looking_for_adviceshould_i_go_all_in_to_buy_my/,1754249462.0,SoCalSimmm,1mgs68l,advice_seeking
FirstTimeHomeBuyer,what to do with extra money,The most frequently asked questions first-time buyers ask. Broken down by each stage of the homebuying process.,"Hey everyone.

I wanted to consolidate all of the questions I get faced with, like one giant FAQ sheet, and then group them in each stage of the process.

I think it will help first time buyers browse this. Not because I think you'll have identical questions, but because you *don't know* which questions to ask.

Here's what everybody else is asking and my thoughts on each of them.

* Stage 1: Planning and preparation
* Stage 2: Pre-approval
* Stage 3: Housing hunt and offers
* Stage 4: Loan processing and underwriting
* Stage 5: Appraisal and inspection
* Stage 6: Clear to close
* Stage 7: Post-close

# Stage 1: Prep and planning stage

This is where you're figuring out if you should jump in or not. Here are the common questions I see:

# How much house can I afford?

It depends. I think we need to rephrase this question.

Do you mean ""How much will a lender approve me for?""

or do you mean ""I need a payment between $\_ and $\_. What kind of house will that get me?""

or do you mean ""I want you to tell me what % of my income I should spend toward a mortgage?""

There are a few points I want to make on this:

1. a lender **approval** does NOT equal **affordability**

A lender will approve people on their gross monthly income, not their net. And they'll sometimes let you go up to 49.99% of your gross income.

Let me emphasize that. GROSS. That's before taxes are taken out. They aren't basing it on residual income, or net take home.

The same goes the other way around.

a lender may approve you way *under* what you believe you can afford, because they won't take into consideration all of your bonus or overtime income. Or they won't take into consideration your self employment side hustle that just started making you more money. Or a second job. You get it, underwriting's numbers won't match yours.

2. I can't tell you what % of your income you should allot for a home. Your spending habits are way different from other people's spending habits. Some people refuse to eat out. Others spend $500+ on dining out. I can't tell you how to spend your money. That leads me to the next point

3. You really need a budget first. See what you're comfortable spending. Set up and budget for an emergency account that you contribute to monthly. Get good homeowner's insurance and a warranty.

Here are a few answers that I think will help.

1. Pick a monthly payment. One that fits your budget, then work in reverse.
2. Use a ""payment to purchase price"" calculator. It helps you work in reverse. Set your monthly payment and it will give you a purchase price.
3. Check out homes around that price. If you like them, then great, if you don't like the houses, then recalibrate.

That's how you get started. You'll want to factor other things, like HOA, property taxes vary state by state.

# What’s the minimum credit score I need to buy a home?

The minimums are lower than you think. This is agency guidelines. Each individual lender may have a threshold above the listed minimums below:

* 500 for FHA loans
   * anything below 580 needs 10%+ down payment
* 620 for conventional loans (there is an exception to go lower -580- but you need a big down payment and recent clean credit activity)
* No minimum for VA and USDA but individual lenders have their preferences

Even if your score is above the minimum, it doesn't guarantee that you'll get a loan.

If you get denied while having above the minimum, the loan officer won't be able to say ""your credit is too low"" but should say more specific things like ""underwriting denied it because of the recent late payments on your credit report""

You may need a mortgage broker who can find a lender that will do a manual underwriting option.

You can also get a mortgage without a credit score. It's more difficult, but you can.

# How much do I need for a down payment?

Conventional

* 3% for first timers
* 3% for buyers with an annual income limit below 80% of the area median income (AMI)
   * Google ""fannie mae AMI lookup tool"" to show you the area median income (AMI) by county. Check if your annual income is 80% or less
* 5% for repeat buyers above the 80% AMI
* 20% down payment to avoid paying a monthly mortgage insurance

FHA

* 3.5% for all buyers with a credit score of 580+
* 10% for all buyers with a credit score between 500-579

USDA

* 0% required

VA

* 0% required

NON-QM

*(NON QM means non-qualified mortgage. These are programs where investors set their own rules, rather than the rules you'll see with mortgage programs listed above. It's a little wild-west, but may be a good option for investors, high write-off self employed buyers, or any other buyer that doesn't fit in the box of conventional and government program guidelines)*

* Typically 20%+ down payment

# Are there programs for first-time homebuyers?

Yes

Searching for these online can be rough. Every lender out there is using all of the SEO tricks to land at the top of search results, and they all want you phone number so they can pitch you on something other than what you're looking for.

**ChatGPT doesn't have advertising (yet)**

If you just asked ChatGPT about programs at a city and state level, it will filter through all of the advertising, and get to the source of the programs.

If Chat sucks at getting the source link, then take the program name and search it in google. It will pull up the source.

Much better than searching ""down payment assistance in \_"" and getting a million different lenders popping up.

**First time buyers with lower income**

Apart from that, if you are a first time buyer, and make 80% or less than the area median income (AMI) then you will receive better rates than someone who makes more than 80%.

*Pro tip: If you can qualify with less income as a first time buyer, try it.*

*I'm not telling you to take a lower paying job.*

*I'm suggesting that if you're qualifying with two incomes, maybe omit one income and see if you still qualify. It might astonish your loan officer that you magically end up with a lower rate. On conventional loans there are breaks on your rate with lower income first time buyers.*

**Local credit unions and banks**

They may offer special portfolio loans for first time buyers as well.

# Should I get pre-qualified or pre-approved first?

People use these words interchangeably and they shouldn't. Here are some traits and how I differentiate qualification and approval.

Pre-qualified: not solid.

* Stated income
* Stated assets
* Soft credit check, maybe one bureau

Pre-approved: more solid

* verified income (pay stubs)
* verified assets (bank statements)
* hard credit check
* automated underwriting passed

One step further would be pre-underwritten

* verified income by loan officer AND underwriter
* verified assets by loan officer AND underwriter
* hard credit report reviewed by underwriter
* automated underwriting passed
* verification employment form completed for any sign of variable income that would need to be averaged out
* there's probably a little more, but can't think of them right now

If a lender offers any sort of guarantee, do what you can to get it. Submitting a guarantee with an offer can help you stand out.

Doing as much as you can up front will ensure a smooth and surprise-free mortgage process while contracts, deadlines, and earnest money deposits are on the line.

So many buyers fly by the seat of their pants as they buy a house:

* bare minimum for a pre-approval letter
* ask loan officer for the absolute max you can get approved for
* shop for homes at the absolute limit
* write an aggressive offer to get it accepted (two week close, finance deadline in 1 week)

This happens so much, and it creates such a stressful homebuying experience.

The underwriter might verify income lower than the loan officer. That destroys your absolute max approval in one go.

Maybe the loan officer didn't account for HOA fees. There goes your max approval.

Give the loan officer as much as you can upfront. See if the officer will run it through underwriting as well. See if the lender will offer any written guarantee you can include with your offers.

# What’s the difference between an FHA loan and a conventional loan?

Here are a few:

**Down Payment**

3.5% FHA minimum for 580+ credit score buyers. 10% for 500-579 credit score buyers

3% Conventional for first timers. 3% for buyers with an annual income limit below 80% of the area median income. 5% for repeat buyers above the 80% AMI. 20% down payment to avoid paying a monthly mortgage

**Credit Scores**

620+ for conventional. 500+ for FHA

Conventional is better-suited for buyers with 740+ credit scores. FHA offers better rates and payments for buyers under 740.

**Mortgage insurance**

Mortgage insurance protects the lender if you default. Loans with less than 20% down payment are considered riskier if they don't have this insurance.

Mortgage insurance is required on all FHA loans, regardless of the down payment. And if you don't put 10% or more, then the FHA mortgage will have mortgage insurance on it for the life of the loan.

FHA has an upfront mortgage insurance charge. It isn't charged to you out of pocket, rather it eats into your home's equity, because it gets financed into the loan. This charge is 1.75% of the loan amount.

Conventional needs mortgage insurance if your down payment is less than 20%

The mortgage insurance can be removed by either waiting for your scheduled equity to hit 22% OR if you've paid extra to reach 20% equity quicker. OR after about 2 years you may request an appraisal if your home's equity has jumped up drastically enough to have 20% equity.

Conventional does NOT charge an upfront mortgage insurance premium.

**Appraisals**

Conventional loans may accept cheaper, quicker appraisals than FHA, or waive it altogether.

You can't waive an FHA appraisal on a purchase.

Some common FHA appraisal issues that end up needing to be fixed and reinspected (re-inspections just add to your closing costs, so try to catch it ahead of time) are:

* wire ends not secured properly (cover them with a plate or in a box similar to outdoor outlet covers.
* Flaking or peeling paint. On older homes, there's a risk the home having lead paint. (the peeling paint must be removed and repainted)

Conventional loans aren't exempt from needing repairs, they just have fewer guidelines, so conventional appraisals are seen as less nitpicky.

**Underwriting**

The way underwriting is handled can be different between FHA and Conventional.

There are a few, but I'll give you one example:

Self employment.

If you are self employed, FHA requires 2 years of self employment taxes for income verification.

Conventional may only require one year of taxes, if you've been in business for 5+ years.

# Do student loans affect my ability to buy a home?

They can.

The minimum monthly payment will count against your debt-to-income ratio.

If you technically don't have a monthly payment, underwriting will set a monthly payment anyway.

If you have deferred student loans, here's how underwriting will calculate it:

**Conventional Fannie Mae:**

1% of the balance will count against your debt-to-income (DTI) ratio. $100 student loan balance will count $1 per month against your DTI.

**Conventional Freddie Mac**

0.5% of the balance will count against your debt-to-income (DTI) ratio. A $100 student loan balance will count $0.50 against your DTI

**FHA**

0.5% of the balance will count against your debt-to-income (DTI) ratio. A $100 student loan balance will count $0.50 against your DTI

**USDA**

0.5% of the balance will count against your debt-to-income (DTI) ratio. A $100 student loan balance will count $0.50 against your DTI

**VA**

5% of the balance, then divided by 12 will count against the debt-to-income ratio (DTI) $100 student loan balance x .05 then / 12 = $0.41 counted against your DTI

If you have a set minimum payment already, then they'll just use that.

**What if on your credit report it shows $0, and I'm on an income driven repayment plan, which is currently also $0?**

A lot of loan officers don't know how to handle this one correctly.

You'll have to go through Fannie Mae conventional.

Freddie Mac wants to know that the loan will be forgiven. FHA wants the loan forgiven. VA may allow it if deferral is at least 12 months after your closing date. USDA won't allow it. Your best bet is to go with the Fannie Mae conventional loan if those student loans are affecting your ability to qualify.

# Can I buy a home if I don’t have a credit score?

Yes. It's more difficult. Even though you *can* get a mortgage without a score, you might as well start building now.

Get a credit card, use it to keep it active, but pay it off immediately. Don't pay interest, it's fine if it reports to the bureaus as a $0 balance.

Get credit quick by getting added as an authorized user on someone else's card. Depending on the credit card provider, you may be able to piggyback off the original owner's history.

# What are closing costs and how much are they?

**What are closing costs?**

Closing costs are the one-time fees you pay at the end of your home purchase, covering everything needed to finalize the loan and transfer ownership of the property.

These can include lender fees, title fees, insurance, and property-related expenses.

**How much are closing costs?**

A very general ballpark estimate is 2% to 6% of your loan amount. But let’s break that down so you understand where that money is actually going.

Lender Fees

These are charged by the mortgage lender and related service providers. They may include:

* Underwriting (\~$1,100): The person reviewing your file to make sure it meets loan guidelines.
* Origination Fee: Charged by the lender for issuing the loan (can vary or be $0).
* Discount Points: Optional upfront fee to buy a lower interest rate.
* Appraisal (\~$700): To verify the value of the home.
* Processing (\~$700): Sometimes charged for organizing the loan file.
* Verification of Employment (\~$100): If done through a paid third-party system.
* Credit Report (\~$100): Charged by the credit bureaus.
* Flood Certificate (\~$8): Confirms if the home is in a flood zone.
* Mortgage Registration (MERS) Fee ($25): Registers who services your mortgage.
* Survey (\~$400): Only in some states. Utah does not require this.
* Lender Title Fees: Old Republic has an online calculator to calculate lender title fees. The lender title policy is the largest cost. The seller will likely pay for the homeowner's policy.

Other Fees

These are related to property ownership and government/HOA charges. I'm using an Ogden UT example for some of these:

* Recording Fee (\~$80 in UT): Registers you as the legal owner with the county.
* Transfer Tax: Varies by state. Utah has no transfer tax; Florida is 0.7% of the loan.
* Prepaid Homeowner’s Insurance (\~$1,170 in Utah): You’ll typically pay one year upfront.
* Prepaid Interest (\~$74.41/day on a $388,000 loan at 7% interest): Based on your closing date, interest rate, and loan amount.
* Property Taxes (\~$178/month (UT example) × 5 months = \~$890): Usually you prepay several months.
* Real Estate Agent/HOA Fees: Some brokerages charge a flat fee (\~$500). If there’s an HOA, you might pay a one-time transfer fee, though it’s negotiable.

# Real-World Example (Ogden, Utah)

Let’s say you’re buying a home in Ogden with no origination fee or discount points. Here's how the numbers might look:

* Lender Fees: \~$4,527
* Other Costs (insurance, taxes, fees, etc.): \~$3,756
* Estimated Closing Costs Total: \~$8,283

# What’s a good interest rate right now?

Lenders advertise rates that are a little misleading. The rate will cost as many discount points as possible, and also an origination fee.

This allows mortgage lenders to advertise a really low APR, even though the buyer will pay a heft some upfront to get that rate.

Use mortgage news daily's website to find realistic average rates WITHOUT the huge discount points.

# STAGE 2: PRE-APPROVAL

This is the stage where you ditch the analysis paralysis, feeling confident enough to jump into applying.

You might even talk to a realtor at this point. Here are some questions people ask at this stage

# What documents do I need to get pre-approved?

They'll want to verify your income. Here's how to go about that:

* Most recent 30 days of pay stubs
* W-2s from the last 2 years
* An HR contact, email, name, and phone number. (An HR contact will help the lender fill out a verification of employment form that helps average out variable income like overtime, bonus, and commission)
* If self-employed: 2 years of tax returns (personal and business), P&L statement for the current year. Proof of tax filing extension if we're past 4/15 and you haven't filed for the previous year.

You'll need to prove you have enough money for the down payment and closing costs.

* Most recent 2 months of bank statements (all pages)
* Statements from retirement or investment accounts if you're using them for the down payment
   * Make sure to list ALL of your assets, even if you won't access them for the purchase. Assets can show as reserves, which come in handy with lower score FHA loans. The loan officer will let you know which funds need to be verified with statements.

The lender will check your credit

* You’ll give permission for the lender to pull your credit report
* No document needed from you, but if your credit is frozen, you’ll need to unlock it
* If any alerts pop up, it's possible you'll need to provide a copy of your social security card

Identification

* A valid photo ID (like a driver’s license or passport)
* Social Security number

Additional (if applicable)

* Divorce decree or child support order (if it affects your income or debts)
* Gift letter if someone is helping you with the down payment
* Green card, visa, or work permit if you’re not a U.S. citizen

# How long does a pre-approval last?

Usually 90 days. I only say that because credit reports are good for 90 days before a new report is needed. If you're still actively shopping and want to be ready to jump on it, you could get your credit pulled again after the first 90 days.

Another thing that might affect your pre-approval is moving interest rates. If rates drop drastically, you could get a more expensive house for around the same payment.

The same goes the other way around.

If rates climb, you'll see your monthly payment climb for the exact same purchase price. Your approval may lower if that's the case.

# Does getting pre-approved hurt my credit?

Another parallel question is: will the credit pull hurt my credit?

Do you know what hurts your credit the most?

* Late payments
* maxed out credit cards
* collections

Getting your credit pulled won't hurt your score like that. Here's what makes up your credit score:

* **Payment history**: 35% Whether you’ve paid past credit accounts on time. This includes late payments, collections, charge-offs, bankruptcies, etc.
* **Amounts owed (credit utilization)**: 30% How much debt you owe compared to your available credit. Lower utilization is better (ideally under 30%).
* **Length of credit history:** 15% How long your credit accounts have been active. Older accounts help your score.
* **Credit mix**: 10% Having a variety of credit types (credit cards, car loans, mortgage, etc.) shows you can manage different kinds of debt.
* **New credit**: 10% How many new accounts or inquiries you’ve had recently. Too many in a short time can lower your score.

Credit pulls is at the very bottom of the list. I won't lie and say ""no effect"", but it's very minimal.

But here's something you might not have known:

When your credit gets pulled for a mortgage, the credit bureaus know. The credit bureaus operate as a business and sell the credit monitoring to other lenders.

It's valuable information for a mortgage lender to know if someone is considering a mortgage.

The minute you get your credit pulled, it will notify all paying lenders about it, and you could receive up to 20 calls per day for two weeks from several different lenders.

Be careful

Some will jump on the phone and say ""Hey! You're approved, here are the next steps.""

If you were waiting to hear back on your pre-approval amount, this phone call might catch you off-guard. I think it's extremely deceptive. They're likely a legitimate business that offers mortgages, but the way they go about it is wrong.

Trying to act as the other lender to get business isn't the way.

To avoid these calls, register your phone number to the do-not-call registry. Google ""register phone to do not call""

Do this right now, or a week before you go to apply.

# Should I apply with more than one lender?

If you are a shopper, this might be a good time to be upfront with everyone.

""hey, I'm getting multiple bids from multiple lenders."" Just so they know. Loan officers get really offended if you don't go with them. Every loan officer thinks they're the best loan officer, and deciding not to work with one is a blow to their ego... or commission.

You'll see their true colors once you say that.

I personally don't know if I'd shop for the best rate. It really depends on the market I'm looking at. If the market is hot, homes are getting scooped up at above asking price, with multiple offers per house, it might make sense to go with a lender that can give you a better chance at winning a bidding war.

Example: one lender provides a 'close on time guarantee' a 'pre-approval guarantee' and calls the listing agent the minute you make an offer to further endorse you as a great buyer.

The other lender is only available 9-5, M-F but rarely answers the phone and operates mostly through email.

Your offer from the first lender will stand out way more than an offer from the second.

A listing agent and seller might go for the offer with the highest likelihood of success. You might just beat out a higher offer. Or rather than accept the highest offer, they could approach your rock solid profile and say ""if you can match this offer, you have a deal.""

Your lender choice can affect that.

If the rate is higher, but it gives a higher likelihood of success, would you take it?

If this is what you're after, then you don't need to apply with multiple lenders. You need to interview them.

If you're just looking for the best rate, then yes, apply with more than one lender. Apply with a local credit union, an online lender, and a local mortgage broker.

Getting your credit pulled more than once in a 30-45 day window for the same product will not impact your score negatively.

# Can I switch lenders later?

Yes.

Some contracts require you inform the seller of any switches in lenders, or require the seller's permission.

Other states/contracts don't.

But you aren't under contract at this stage yet. So you can pick whoever you want, even if it isn't the first lender you got pre-approved with.

# What’s included in the monthly mortgage payment?

Your monthly payment is made up of

* Principal and interest
* Property taxes
* Homeowner's insurance
* Mortgage insurance

You can find principal and interest on any online calculator.

You can find property taxes pretty easily, Zillow sometimes even lists the annual bill.

Homeowner's insurance, I'd google ""average homeowner's insurance in \_state\_""

Mortgage insurance can vary on conventional loans depending on your debt-to-income ratio, your credit score, and your down payment.

# What is DTI (debt-to-income ratio), and why does it matter?

Your debt-to-income ratio, or DTI, is exactly how it sounds. It's your debts, divided by your income, given as a percentage.

Now these aren't ALL of your debts. You don't need to go around collecting things like your Netflix bill, or your cell phone bill. It only refers to the debts that actually show up on your credit report.

For easy numbers, if I make $100 per month, and I have a credit card that charges me $1 per month, my current DTI is 1%

If I apply for a mortgage, and that mortgage is $20 per month, my total DTI will be 21%.

**Housing ratio vs total debt ratio**

Now for an FHA loan, a lender might also look at DTI two ways:

Your housing to income ratio and then your total DTI.

In this scenario I have a 20% housing ratio, and a 21% total DTI ratio. ($20 housing payment, $1 credit card payment)

20% because my housing payment is 20% of my income ($100 per month), and 21% total DTI because that's all of my debts, the credit card plus the mortgage.

Conventional and FHA loans won't qualify you if your DTI ratio is too high.

# Can I use gift funds for the down payment?

Yes.

In most cases.

If your credit score is low, and you're going with an FHA loan, it might be more favorable to show funds of your own rather than a gift.

# STAGE 3: HOUSE HUNTING & MAKING AN OFFER

These questions will be tough, because each market is so different. Buyer's markets and seller's markets can be in certain pockets geographically. Or a certain price can be hotter than other prices, despite the trend leaning towards buyers or sellers.

So I'll try to answer on both sides.

# What’s a reasonable price to offer?

This will depend on each individual house. Check out time on the market. Are the sellers in a hurry?

There's a bit from the book ""Never Split the Difference"" that I want to reference. Chris Voss mentioned negotiating with hostage-takers in Haiti.

He knew that these people would release hostages for a lower price when you got closer to the weekend. Because these guys wanted money to party over the weekend. The closer it got to Friday, the more flexible they became.

The point I'm trying to make here is the seller might have his own deadline. ""I have to sell the home by \_ date""

Getting that information is key. You need a good agent who is willing to talk it out and extract that information, and use it like an assassin.

If the seller is in that position, it could make sense to offer something lower. Structure the contract so it closes quickly, and at a low purchase price.

Here's a real-example that closed just recently (5/30)

A home went back on the market. Something happened with the previous buyer's financing.

The seller was under contract to buy another property, and it needed to happen in 2 weeks, or things could fall apart.

We agreed, but for a price. $20k lower price and $13,000 in seller paid closing costs. It would net the seller $33k less than the offer they previously had.

People could complain that we took advantage. But first time buyers have a lot to be upset about too.

Deadlines and other circumstances can help you get a good deal. Getting a good agent is important here.

Each house and the reason for sale has a story. Find the story, and you may be able to find out the best price to offer.

# What happens if the home doesn’t appraise for what I offered?

You'll have 5 options to explore if the appraisal comes in lower than the purchase price:

* Cancel the contract (depending on contract verbiage)
* Ask the seller to lower the purchase price
* Pay the difference in cash
* Don't do anything (if you have a large enough down payment, your down payment can absorb the low appraisal hit)
* Fight the appraiser (ask for reconsideration of value)

If it comes in higher than the purchase price, you won't have to raise the purchase price. You'll just get a little more equity than you planned.

# Can I ask the seller to help with closing costs?

Yes, if you're tight on cash, or need it for move in expenses, then this is a great option for you.

Here are the maximum limits a seller or interested party can contribute toward your closing costs:

Conventional primary residence:

* 3% if your down payment is less than 10%
* 6% if you put a down payment of 10%-25%
* 9% if your down payment is more than 25%

FHA

* 6%

VA

* 4%

USDA

* 6%

# How much earnest money should I put down?

How strong do you need to make this offer?

More earnest money shows a stronger offer.

1% is common

You could say ""$0"" but it makes you look less serious.

# What contingencies should I include in my offer?

Here are some possible contingencies that you can put in your contract:

* Financing (if you can't get the financing, you can cancel, and possibly retain earnest money)
* Appraisal (if the appraisal doesn't come in at least at purchase price, you can cancel)
* Sale of current home (you need your current home to sell in order to complete the purchase)
* inspection (you may cancel if something pops up in the inspection, and if the seller refuses to negotiate to your liking)
* HOA review (you can read the rules and restrictions and cancel depending if there's something you don't like)
* Due diligence (in some states, this is a very broad term that lets you cancel for almost any reason in the due diligence period)

Sellers look for less friction, so if you need to make your offer compelling, see if you'd be willing to cut any of these.

I'd aim to keep as many as you can while still giving yourself a chance at getting an acceptance.

# How do I compete with cash buyers?

I have a feeling there are fewer cash buyers than there really are.

It's just a suspicion with no evidence.

I think bad agents are too afraid to call the other agent. They text, and email. If they don't get a response, and the home gets under contract, they chalk it up to ""we lost to an investor, cash offer.""

Okay so I looked it up, and cash sales are actually at close to 1/3 (33%)

I stand corrected. But I still think there are timid agents out there.

Anyway, here are some ideas on beating a cash offer, and it really depends on what you can extract from the seller's motivation:

* Remove contingencies (be careful):
   * You can't get away from the financing contingency, but removing others could strengthen your offer.
   * Appraisal waivers exist, even on financing. The lender may waive the appraisal, so check with your loan officer before submitting your offer (if you have time to check in)
* Write a letter that might tug at the seller's heartstrings
* Write an escalation clause (""I'll beat any offer by $\_\_ up to $\_\_ "")
* Give a generous leaseback agreement
   * If you and your agent find out that the seller needs flexibility with move out arrangements, then offer it (if you can afford to give flexibility). A leaseback agreement means that you'll allow them to stay in the home after the sale, for a certain amount of time at specific financial terms.
* Have your lender go the extra mile
   * I've covered this earlier, but if your lender can provide guarantees and also call to endorse you as a strong buyer, that will make your finance contingency seem like less of an issue.
   * Get pre-underwritten, not just pre-approved.
* Shorten your deadlines
   * It's possible the seller wants it to be done quickly. A cash buyer may want more time to close. Check with your lender on how fast you can get it done.

# What does “under contract” mean?

It means you and the seller have agreed to terms, and will work on completing those terms to finalize the sale of the home.

# How long does it take to close once my offer is accepted?

The lending portion might take the longest. The absolute fastest you could close is 7 business days after receiving your loan estimate.

It's more typical to take about 2-4 weeks after an offer is accepted to finalize the purchase.

# STAGE 4: LOAN PROCESSING & UNDERWRITING

The offer is accepted. The buyer submits full documentation, and the lender processes the loan.

# Why does the lender need so many documents?

Because of the 2008 financial crisis.

I'm not saying that needing documents is bad. We don't want a crisis to happen again. And the government put rules in place to ensure it won't.

The most common lending, Conventional loans, go through fannie mae and freddie mac, which are government sponsored enterprises. As long as they are sponsored and under federal oversight, they'll continue checking specific boxes for homebuyers.

There are documents needed to make sure you aren't overextending yourself on your budget.

There are documents needed to make sure the home is free and clear of other liens and encumbrances.

There are documents needed to prove your assets aren't illegally produced, or produced through acquiring more debt.

Another reason so many documents are needed is because someone else cheated. When cheaters play, more rules/documents get set up to stop the cheaters.

Example: Self employment is where a lot of cheaters cheat. (photoshop is an amazing tool). To counteract, most lenders require tax transcripts to match a buyer's tax returns.

Lenders need to compare what you filed with the IRS directly, to what you provided in tax returns.

# Can I change jobs during the mortgage process?

Yes.

But it has the potential to ruin your mortgage.

Here's what I mean:

If your pay structure changes, like a move from salary to commission, you might be able to make more money, but underwriting looks at commission as less-stable than salary.

Going from salary to hourly is risky in the sense as well.

But going to a salary income is usually the safest.

If your new job can't provide proof that you're guaranteed to start within 90 days, underwriting won't take the new income. Proving that you're guaranteed to start within 90 days means you need a non-contingent job offer. Contingencies are usually things like drug test and background checks.

Are you changing jobs the day before you close?

That will most likely delay your closing. If you're going to change jobs, maybe talk with your loan officer first. I know the loan officer isn't your career coach, but just see if it's possible.

# Is it okay to open a new credit card or buy furniture now?

I'd wait until your loan has funded and the deed has recorded.

All new credit inquiries will be investigated during your mortgage process.

Here's an experience that should help answer this.

Someone entered their social security number incorrectly. The loan officer ran the report, but didn't catch the mismatch number.

The buyer then went on to max out all of her credit cards in pursuit of furniture.

This tanked her credit score.

The lender needed a new credit report.

Those new credit card balances and new credit score showed up.

This drastically changed her loan. (worse rate, worse mortgage insurance, worse closing costs)

She still got the home, but that move cost way more than the furniture itself.

To be safe, I'd wait.

# What is a rate lock, and should I lock my rate now?

When you lock your rate, your lender is basically saying: “We’ll honor this interest rate even if the market changes.”

Most locks are good for 30-60 days, sometimes longer if you're building a home.

Why lock? Because rates can jump unexpectedly. A rate lock gives you some peace of mind. You can budget around a predictable payment, even if rates spike next week.

This allows you to get your financing in order with a predictable payment and closing costs.

I'd lock as soon as you can, just to be safe. No one really knows what rates are going to do, and not locking is gambling.

# What happens if interest rates drop after I lock?

If you don't know that rates dropped, and don't do any inquiries, then nothing happens.

If you're ignorant to rate drops, the lender probably won't tell you that rates have dropped.

locking in a rate protects you if rates climb, but you normally won't be able to take advantage of any rate drops.

There are exceptions. Look into rate re-negotiations, or float-down policies. You could also switch lenders, but that's an extreme option.

# What are loan conditions?

You may have gotten a 'conditional approval"" which is underwriting's way of saying, the loan application looks good, just get us **these things**, and we can get you the loan.

""These things"" are the conditions.

# What if I don’t understand something the underwriter is asking for?

You have a loan officer that can help answer any clarifications on underwriting requests.

You might also have a loan processor, which is sort of like a junior underwriter. If you can speak with a loan processor, they can usually translate the request to more simple English, or tell you exactly what document to get in order to clear the request.

**I reached character limits. I'll comment a link to continue.**

* Stage 1: Planning and preparation
* Stage 2: Pre-approval
* Stage 3: Housing hunt and offers
* Stage 4: Loan processing and underwriting
* Stage 5: Appraisal and inspection

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,what to do with extra money,Is it odd or a bad idea to wait years and save up for a 60% down payment or so? Why not just wait?,"Hey,

So at the moment I am renting and am able to save a few thousand a month for a down payment. I have $60,000 in a HYSA and anything extra is going directly into a taxable investment account mostly in FSKAX.

Combine I have about $90,000 in these accounts now, so with a 20% down payment I can go for a $450,000 house at the moment and should be pretty in the clear as far a suggestions here go.

However, when I look at any amortization charts they are fucking insane. Most seem to say I would be paying mostly interest and putting very little into my own equity for years. YEARS. I get bored halfway through movies I like, I'm probably going to be bored of this house in less than 10 years and want to move or sell. Even if I force myself to stay and not sell, that's years of paying a bank and not myself.

Then, when I do end the 30 year mortgage I would have paid like $600,000 just to have the privilege to borrow \~$360,000. How is this acceptable to anyone? It seems like a bad idea 100% of the time, though I am just kind of ranting here.

Would it be weird, or odd, or a bad idea, if I just wait a few more years and get that down payment to something like $260,000? I have no need for a permanent home for at least 3 or 4 years when the baby is old enough to need a home base/home town/first grade.

If I don't mind renting, and have no need to stay anywhere permanent yet, isnt waiting a bunch of years the best play? What could I be missing. I know I make good money so this isn't an option for everyone, but it seems like no one ever suggests saving for a >20% down payment.",57,https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/comments/1fgmtu4/is_it_odd_or_a_bad_idea_to_wait_years_and_save_up/,1726322715.0,Ok_Shake_4761,1fgmtu4,advice_seeking
FirstTimeHomeBuyer,what to do with extra money,For anyone on the fence about buying right now,"

I’m not trying to tell anyone what to do with their lives and their money, but I research the housing market a lot, and I’m posting as an encouragement for you folks to do some extra research before buying so that you can make the most informed decision in your life. 

Please look into current and predicted macroeconomic market trends in the housing market. There is a high probability that house prices will be forced down over the next two years, and there is a lot of information that points to this likelihood. The consumer is seriously hurting right now, and a lot of people will be hurting a lot worse when forced to sell in negative equity, but you don’t need to be a part of that crowd. 

If you’re feeling like things are too expensive, it’s because they are. Just a word to the wise, time is in your favor in regard to buying. 

People like Melody Wright, Adam Taggart, Todd Sachs, and many others are all ringing the alarm bell on the housing market. These are very educated, and informed people that have significant research to back their outlook.

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,bonus invest,"Landlord wants to sell me the house I'm living in, I really don't want to move. Can I afford it? Would you do it? $440k in Florida","Hey everyone!

Got the news this week that my landlord is looking to sell the house I'm currently in and they're letting me get first pick before it goes on the market in 2 months. They're looking to get $440K for it, which is about on-par with houses in the neighborhood of similar size and age. 

The house itself I absolutely love, it's well-built and has been mine and my wife's comfortable home for the past year. Torn on if I should pull the trigger on this decision or if I'm being naive. So, here's the details:

* **Income**: $145k base w/ 10% bonus and OT, this year = $170k
* **Savings**: $24k emergency fund + $40k down payment, both in HYSA
* **Investments**: $20k IRA + $35k 401K

The only debt I have is a car payment for $450/mo on a Honda. 

I'm in the central Florida area, and a house this size (1200 sq ft) and age typically goes for around this price, give or take 50k. Additionally, it's close to the metro center so I feel like property values will remain more stable than outskirts and exurbs. 

Estimates from my credit union and insurance company puts the PITI right around $3800/mo, which is about $1400/mo more than I have been paying in rent. If I were to move, similar houses are going for about $2300-2500/mo, so it would be a steep increase.

Alternatives are to either:

* Try and purchase a cheaper house, maybe in a neighborhood more on the outskirts where property is cheaper
* Continue renting and invest the difference while saving up for a larger down payment",48,https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/comments/1hgsqjv/landlord_wants_to_sell_me_the_house_im_living_in/,1734492709.0,DrDiv,1hgsqjv,advice_seeking
FirstTimeHomeBuyer,bonus invest,"Need advice, buying a house in VHCOL.","Hello, we are family of 4 with two kids (7yo and 2yo). We are looking to get a SFH in the NY/NJ subarbs so VHCOL. I wanted advice on whether we are overextending. I work (employed) and my wife is a SAHM. Both the kids currently are in a private daycare/school.

My NW is $1.85M, out of which $1M is liquid. My current take home pay is 210k per year after taxes. Bonus is usually around 160k per year after taxes. 

We have been trying to buy a house for the past five years. We have been disillusioned by the prices and the interest rate and never found anything that would meet the budget. And lately I have realised that maybe we were being too conservative. 

Finally, we have found one that meets 85% of our needs, but it's priced at $1.95M. My heart tells me that it's too expensive but I also have years worth of data and nothing tells me that I would be able to get 85% of our needs met by anything that's well under 1.95M. 

I wanted to ask this group if I making the right decision. We have a quote for a 7/6 arm that's at 5.625% and that brings our total monthly payment at 9k per month including mortgage, home insurance and taxes (down payment is 750k). That monthly payment is ~55% of my monthly take home. Setting aside other monthly costs including cleaning, utilities, daycare for the 2yo, car, groceries - we would only be saving 8% of our monthly take home. So no money left to invest. (I'm not counting the bonus, of course)

While my total compensation has gradually increased over the past 5 years, I don't anticipate it to grow any further in a very dramatic fashion (even inflation raises are rare at my level).

So all this text, to ask a simple question - am I commiting a financial suicide? Am I over extending or is it okay given the very high cost of living. (Just for reference our housing costs currently is 6.6k per month).",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/comments/1l7mjx1/need_advice_buying_a_house_in_vhcol/,1749519412.0,pf_noob1,1l7mjx1,advice_seeking

# Know your budget

Before you talk with anyone, take a good look at your budget. If you were to buy a home today, what is a payment that you could work with? What is a payment that might stretch your budget? What is the payment that you absolutely cannot go over?

You'll need to know this beforehand, otherwise this could happen to you:

You contact a real estate agent. The agent refers you to their trusted loan officer. The loan officer takes your information and says ""you're approved for $\_\_ (fill in the blank).

You go out and look at homes for $\_\_(fill in the blank). You find one you absolutely love. The agent helps you write an offer for $\_\_. The seller accepts the offer for $\_\_ and you're under contract. Congratulations!

Then you look at the Loan Estimate and you get what they call ""sticker shock"".

You think ""I can't afford that"" and you're about to call the realtor but then you, or you and your significant other start to rationalize.

""Well, we could make it work. I could pick up a second job and we could cut out \_\_ and \_\_""

So you stick with the contract. You buy the house. Congratulations! You're uncomfortably 'house poor' as they say.

Don't get me wrong here, I'm all for making it work if you want it badly enough, but in this scenario, the buyer is unsure if they can really make it work. They haven't gotten a second job yet, they haven't cut out \_\_ and \_\_ yet.

There's the saying ""If you don't plan your time, someone will help you waste it"". It's especially true here. If you don't plan your money, someone will help you waste it.

Loan officers have a tendency to only reveal the max approval amount. Agents tend to show you homes right around that approval amount. But unless you press the loan officer for more specific details, he/she probably won't give them to you.

This leads me to the next tip. What goes into a mortgage payment?

# Calculate your mortgage payment

Your payment is broken up into 4 parts.

Principal and interest

Property taxes

Homeowner's insurance

Mortgage insurance

# Principal and Interest

[Here's a calculator for you](https://integritylending.tools/calculator). This will give you an estimate on the payment, AND closing costs. Keep reading, because you'll want to know what goes into a payment, and what goes into closing costs.

A question you probably have is ""if I haven't spoken to a mortgage loan officer yet, how will I know my interest rate?""

[I'd use this site](https://www.mortgagenewsdaily.com/). It's more realistic with rates. Other sites will advertise the lowest rate possible, but it comes with paying discount points.

This site also lets you know the day to day movements and trends with mortgage rates.

# Property Taxes

Taxes vary property to property, depending on the state, county and city that they're in.

Zillow can make it pretty easy to find this. Just search for properties in the area that you're looking in, and the price range you're looking in. Pull up a property, then scroll through the listing. There's a section called ""Public Tax History"". If it's empty, just pull up another property.

Once you find that amount, divide it by 12 for the monthly payment.

# Homeowner's Insurance

This also varies by city and state. Google 'average cost of homeowner's insurance in *insert city and state*.'

Take that amount and divide by 12 for the monthly amount.

# Mortgage Insurance

If you're looking at an FHA loan with a minimum down payment, your mortgage insurance rate will be uniform.

Take the loan amount, multiply by 0.0055 and then divide by 12.

If you're looking at a Conventional loan, mortgage insurance will adjust depending on your credit score, your debt-to-income ratio, and your down payment.

For now let's use a factor of .0035.

Take the loan amount, multiply by .0035 and then divide by 12.

# Bringing it all together

I'll use a real scenario for this.

I'm looking at a $400,000 purchase price. I plan on a minimum down payment, Conventional 3% down ($12,000) and a loan amount of $388,000.

If I use a rate of 7% and a 30 year term, the principal and interest payment will be $2,581.37

The annual property tax bill was $2,136 in 2023 (not as recent, but still works). After dividing by 12, the monthly payment will be $178.

Ogden Utah has an average annual rate of $1,170. Divided by 12 is $97.50.

Mortgage insurance will be the loan amount $388,000 x .0035 / 12 = $113.16 per month.

The grand total payment will add up all of these payments into one single payment. $2,970.03.

# HOA

HOA will not be in your mortgage payment, but it is a cost that you'll need to budget for, and the lender will count this HOA payment against your debt-to-income ratio (DTI).

# Tip 2. Plan for your upfront costs

There are two bits to this: Down payment and closing costs.

# Down Payment

Here are some loan programs and the associated down payment:

VA: $0 down payment. This loan is for eligible military veterans.

USDA: $0 down payment. Rural areas with household income limits.

Conventional: 3% for first time homebuyers. 3% with income limits for non-first time homebuyers. 5% without income limits for previous homeowners.

FHA: 3.5% for all buyers. (there are loan limits. The intention for these loans is for primary residences, and discourages using this program for collecting investment properties)

Down Payment Assistance: These are usually state programs and vary state by state, but I've seen a few similarities. It comes as a second mortgage, and will cover the down payment and closing costs up to a certain amount. You'll want to factor this second mortgage into your payment if you go this route. It can be on a 30 year term with the interest rate being 1% or 2% higher than your first mortgage.

# Closing Costs

A rough estimate of closing costs is 2%-4% of the loan.

These fees can be separated between lender fees, and other costs. These other costs are related to the ownership (up front taxes and insurance)

# Lender Fees

Here are the lender fees you may see:

Underwriting \~$1,100

Origination Fee $X whatever the lender feels like charging.

Discount Points $X this depends on what rate you get relative to the market rate. I'd avoid this fee unless the seller is paying for it.

Appraisal \~$700

Processing \~$700

Verification of Employment \~$100

Credit Report \~$100

Flood Certificate \~$8

Mortgage Registration fee (MERS) $25

Some states require a survey fee \~$400

**Lender Title Fees**

These fees vary by state and loan amount. A $388,000 loan amount in Utah would have a total of about $1,794 in title fees.

[Use this title fee calculator to estimate the loan policy and other fees.](https://www.oldrepublictitle.com/rate-calculator/) Just select your state and enter the loan amount. It's simple to use. It may give you two separate policies. The lender policy and the owner's policy. In most states, it's customary for the seller to pay for the owner's coverage. But the buyer will cover the lender's policy.

# Other Fees

Here are the other costs you may see:

Recording fee \~$80

**Transfer tax**

This fee depends on the state; there are 14 states that do not charge a transfer tax.

In Florida, for example, they charge 0.7% but in Utah there isn't a transfer tax. Take that loan amount and multiply by 0.007 in Florida and you'll end up with a **$2,716** charge.

**Prepaid Homeowner's Insurance**

Remember when we found the monthly payment for homeowner's insurance? You'll need to pay the annual policy in full up front. The monthly amount is really just set up to save for next year's bill.

In Utah, that bill was **$1,170.**

**Prepaid interest**

Prepaid interest depends on the day of the month you close. You'll pay interest for the remainder of the month. If you close on the 1st of the month, you'll get charged for the 30 days.

If you close on the last day of the month, you'll be charged 1 day of interest.

The daily interest is your annual rate (7% in this case) divided by 365. Then multiply that by the loan amount. That's your daily rate.

Example: .07 / 365 x $388,000 = $74.41 interest per diem.

**Property taxes**

You'll get charged a little bit of property taxes up front. The seller will pay for their portion of property taxes for the year, and you'll pay about 5 months worth up front.

**Real Estate Agent and HOA fees**

Your real estate sales agent's brokerage might have a fee. Maybe around $500, but you'll want to ask the sales agent about these fees as you decide on an agent. With the NAR settlement, it's possible you could see a case where the seller refuses to pay for the buyer's sales agent's commission. If that's the case, then you as the buyer would need to pay that commission out of pocket.

If there is an HOA on the property, and if the property charges a fee to transfer the account into your name, there could be a chance that you end up paying that HOA transfer fee. Negotiate the seller to pay for this one.

# Putting it all together

Okay, I'm going to continue the example of my Ogden City Utah purchase, and show how to plan for closing costs.

I'll go with an interest rate that does not charge any discount points.

This loan does not have an origination fee.

I'll plan on paying the underwriting, appraisal, processing, credit report, flood certificate, VOE, MERS, and lender title fees. Utah does not require surveys for purchases

The lender fee total should add up to \~$4,527

For the ""Other Fees"" which are more related to homeownership costs, I'll plan on paying the recording fee, Utah does not do transfer taxes, 1 year of homeowner's insurance, let's say I close on the 16th so I'll have about 15 days of prepaid interest ($74.41 x 15), \~5 months of property taxes($178.00 x 5), and let's say the seller is paying for the agent's commission and I have to pay a $500 broker fee. This home does not have an HOA.

The ""Other Fees"" should add up to about $3,756.15

My grand total in closing costs will be \~$8,283.15

My total cash needed at closing will be my down payment + closing costs - any seller credits negotiated. Let's say in this case the seller didn't pay any seller credits, so I'd be left with total out of pocket of about $20,283.

At the beginning of this section I mentioned closing costs would be about 2%-4%. This $8,283 total landed at 2.1% of the loan amount. But with Utah having lower homeowner's insurance, lower title insurance, lower property taxes, and no transfer taxes, you can see how it could easily get into the 4% territory in a more expensive state.

# Tip 2.1 Saving for the upfront costs

You might have gotten to this point and thought ""I can't save $100, how can I save for $20,000+?"" Well the good news is you might have been saving for this moment without even realizing it.

# Get a gift

Okay, you didn't really save for this, but maybe your parents have been planning on helping you buy your first house. Just give them a call, see how they're doing, and ask them for money.

They might laugh at you. But they might also say ""Yeah, we've been planning for this.""

# Sell an asset

Do you see that decent car parked outside? Maybe it's time to downgrade. Good thing your new house will be walking distance from your job and the grocery store.

# Retirement

For a first time purchase, you may have an option to pull up to $10,000 from your 401k or retirement account without the early penalty. *Double check this, rules change.*

# Take out a loan

See that decent car parked outside? Remember how you dedicated that extra money to pay it off early? Well underwriting will let you pull money out as a loan against that car and count it as an asset.

Unsecured loans do not work (credit cards, personal loans etc.)

Factor in the new debt into your debt-to-income ratio, because this option might just ruin your shot at qualifying.

# Negotiate closing costs be paid for by the seller

A large chunk of the money you'll need is in closing costs. A seller cannot pay for your down payment, but they could pay for your closing costs.

*If you're doing a Conventional loan with less than 10% down payment, the seller is allowed to contribute up to 3% of the purchase price toward your closing costs.*

*If you're doing an FHA loan, the seller is allowed to contribute up to 6% of the purchase price toward your closing costs.*

# Getting pre-qualified

So you know how much money it's going to take, both up front and monthly. You're feeling confident now, but you could be feeling a little more confident. You have that nagging thought, will I even get qualified? What if they tell me no? I can handle the payment, I have the money for the down payment and closing costs, but they still might tell me no.

Here are a few tips to let you know if you'll qualify ahead of time.

# Check out your debt-to-income ratio

Your debt-to-income ratio, or DTI, is exactly how it sounds. It's your debts, divided by your income, given as a percentage.

Now these aren't ALL of your debts. You don't need to go around collecting things like your Netflix bill, or your cell phone bill. It only refers to the debts that actually show up on your credit report.

For easy numbers, if I make $100 per month, and I have a credit card that charges me $1 per month, my current DTI is 1%

If I apply for a mortgage, and that mortgage is $20 per month, my total DTI will be 21%.

Now for an FHA loan, a lender might also look at DTI two ways. Your housing to income ratio and then your total DTI.

In this scenario I have a 20% housing ratio, and a 21% total DTI ratio. 20% because my housing payment is 20% of my income, and 21% total DTI because that's all of my debts, the credit card plus the mortgage.

Conventional and FHA loans won't qualify you if your DTI ratio is too high.

Where do they draw the line?

Conventional will push it as high as 49% DTI at the moment. (It's stressful to toe the line though, if homeowner's insurance comes in higher than estimated, you could suddenly get disqualified)

FHA will want your housing ratio under 47% and your total DTI under 56%

VA doesn't have a specific rule on DTI. They're more concerned about residual income (what's leftover after the bills are paid.)

# How does underwriting calculate income?

This can be really simple if you're a salary employee

Take your annual salary, divide it by 12, and you're done. That's it. That's your monthly income.

$60k salary / 12 months = $5k monthly income

Not everyone's income is that easy though. There's

* Hourly, with guaranteed hours
* Hourly, with varying hours
* Commission
* Bonus
* Overtime
* Seasonal
* 2nd jobs
* Piece rate
* Paid by the mile
* Self employed
* There are more, but this will hopefully cover 95% of us

Also, as a side note, almost everything you need to know about how underwriting calculates income can be found on [Fannie Mae's selling guide here.](https://selling-guide.fanniemae.com/)

# Hourly with guaranteed hours

This one is just as good as salary.

Hourly rate x guaranteed hours per week x 52 / 12

So if I'm $40 per hour and 40 hours per week, I'd take 40 x 40 x 52 / 12 = $6,933.33 per month

# Hourly with varying hours

If you worked with a single company for the entire calendar year Jan 1st to Dec 31st, you could look at that year end paystub. Take that Gross YTD amount and divide by 12, that is the quick and rough way to calculate your income.

If you're a few months into the new year and want to get more precise, take the year end pay stub, then take your most recent pay stub, we'll say it covered through the end of March.

Add up the YTD for each pay stub and then divide that by 15. That will be your monthly income.

Example: 2024 I made $61,245 on my hourly YTD gross.

On my most recent pay stub that covered halfway through May I made $22,966. That's 4.5 months into the year (May isn't done yet, so it isn't quite 5)

I'll add $61,245 + $22,966 = $84,211 then divide by 16.5 (12 months + the 4.5) = $5,103.69 per month.

# Commission/Bonus/Overtime

These are calculated the same way. Grab a 2 year history and average it out. If any of these are lowering year to year, then that income might not be included at all. If it has declined, but then stabilized, it may be included.

The easiest way to calculate this would be to grab your two most recent end of year pay stubs and look at the line that says ""Commission"" or ""Bonus"" or ""Overtime"".

Then look at your most recent pay stub, we'll say it's mid May again.

Overtime in year 1 was $13,850

Overtime in year 2 was $14,950

Overtime through mid May $5,700

Add up the totals and divide by 28.5 months = $1,210 overtime per month

# Seasonal Income

Let's say you're a teacher and pick up a job every summer doing entertainment on a cruise line because you're also a fairly talented singer.

As long as you've been doing the cruise line for 2 years, just take your 2 years of W2s from the job and divide it out by 24. That will be what underwriting counts as your monthly income for qualifying.

Year 1 W2 = $21,000

Year 2 W2 = 22,500

$43,500 / 24 = $1,812.50

# Second Jobs

Second jobs are viewed and calculated similar to Seasonal Income.

If you have 2 years history of working a second job concurrently with the primary job, then they'll count it.

It will likely be a varying hour position. I'd use your two end of year pay stubs, and your most recent pay stub to calculate your average.

Year 1 pay stub = $22,000

Year 2 pay stub = $22,500

Mid May pay stub = $8,437.50

$52,937.50 / 28.5 = $1,857.45 monthly that you'd be able to count toward your qualifying income.

# Piece rate/paid by the mile

I've seen underwriters get real picky with Truck driver's income. It can get especially difficult if they've recently switched from one structure to another, by the mile to hourly, or vice versa.

Any change to your pay structure can reset the clock on this. The same goes for employees who are paid by piece.

What you'll need is 12 months history minimum, and your most recent 12 month average will by your qualifying income. Example:

Let's say you started September 1st last year, and it is conveniently September 1st of this year.

Take your end of year pay stub, and then your most recent pay stub (covering through the end of August) and divide that by 12.

Last year $26,667

This year to date $53,333

$80,000 / 12 = $6,666

# Self Employed

They call self employed income as the double edged sword in lending. On one hand, business owners hate paying taxes, so they write off as much as they can. But on the lending side, as you write off your expenses, you are at the same time lowering your qualified income.

There are a lot of ways you can set up your business. I'm going to take the easiest one, Schedule C (LLC), and work with that.

If you're doing an FHA loan, you'll do an average of 2 years. If the most recent year is declining from the prior year, it will be under more scrutiny. ""Why are you making less this year than last? Is your business failing? Should we plan on more decline?""

If you're doing a Conventional loan, you'll also do an average of 2 years, but may be able to only need 1 year as long as you've been operating the business for over 5 years total.

If you look at your tax form at the schedule C, line 31 shows your net profit. Simple math says take that number, divide by 12 and that's the year's monthly income.

There are only a few write offs that can be added back into the income: Depletion, depreciation, and business miles traveled.

The write off ""meals and entertainment"" get removed from the total income.

Business miles traveled is returned to the qualifying income depending on the IRS mileage rate for the year. (0.64 per mile in 2024)

Let's do a quick example of how I'd look at calculating my income as self employed.

Year 1 Net profit = $84,000

Year 2 Net profit = $84,000 and $1,000 depreciation was written off.

$169,000 / 24 = $7,041.66 monthly income.

# Debts

Earlier I mentioned that you only need to include the debts that show up on your credit report. That wasn't 100% true. There are a couple of things that you'll need to consider outside of the credit report.

* Child Support
* Alimony
* Student Loans
* Collections in aggregate totaling over $2,000

You'll need to include child support and alimony in your monthly liabilities.

You may have student loans that have deferred payments, meaning a payment isn't reporting on your credit report. Lenders usually won't allow that to be at $0.

They'll take your student loan balance and calculate a monthly payment as a placeholder, which will count against your DTI

* Fannie Mae (Conventional) 1% of the student loan balance. ($50,000 x .01 = $500 monthly payment)
* FHA and Freddie Mac (the other Conventional) 0.5% of the student loan balance ($50,000 x .005 = $250 monthly payment)

On an FHA loan, if I have a collection for $1,200 with one company, and $900 with another, I'll need to factor in 5% of the balance as a monthly liability.

$2,100 x .05 = $105

# Bringing it all together

Let's build out a profile. Here are the debts:

* Auto loan $255 monthly payment
* $56,000 in student loan debt
* Credit card payment $25 monthly payment
* No child support or alimony
* No collection accounts
* New mortgage payment $2,970.03

Let's calculate the income:

* $43 per hour
* Guaranteed 40 hours per week
* $1,115 per month in overtime income, but only 6 months on the job
* Previous job did not pay overtime

If we're going with a Fannie Mae Conventional loan, here are what the debts, we'd factor in a student loan payment of $560.00. So total debts are $560 + $255 + $25 +$2,970.03 = $3,810.03

For income, we won't include the overtime income because we don't have at least 12 months history receiving it. $43 x 40 x 52 / 12 = $7,453.33

Now to get the DTI ratio, we must take debts / income.

$3,810.03 / $7,453.33 = 51.11%

For a Fannie Mae Conventional loan, this person would not qualify, because the debt-to-income ratio is above 49%

If we pivot to Freddie Mac the debts would look a little different. The student loan would be half of that amount.

$280 + $255 + $25 +$2,970.03 = $3,530.03

$3,530.03 / $7,453.33 = 47%

Without looking at other factors like credit score and other credit events, this would qualify for a Freddie Mac Conventional loan.

Let's go through a quick exercise to calculate the two ratios for an FHA loan to see if this would qualify.

With FHA, your mortgage insurance will be higher, so the mortgage payment will be higher. I'm going to add about $65 per month to the mortgage insurance.

$2,970.03 + $65 = $3,035.03 new housing payment

$3,035.03 / $7,453.33 = 40.7% housing ratio, or the ""front end DTI"" (this qualifies with FHA)

Then the total DTI is $3,595.03 / $7,453.33 = 48.23% total DTI or the ""backend DTI"" (This qualifies with FHA)

If DTI is an issue for qualifying, here are some tips to lower your DTI...

# Lower your DTI

When DTI becomes an issue, all is not lost. I don't recommend pushing your DTI too high because it will hurt your budget and possibly make you house-poor, but when the DTI gets tight because of something like a student loan payment, which is a hypothetical payment, or because underwriting won't take your bonus income into account, then I think these tips will be helpful in lowering your DTI.

# Get a cosigner

This is the easiest, because as long as the cosigner's DTI is better than yours, and if the credit score matches yours or better, then this will be a net positive.

# Sell the asset attached to the debt

If you can live without it, getting rid of that monthly payment completely by selling the vehicle can help your DTI.

# Restructure your debt

If your credit card payments are mounting, and if your car has equity, consider a cash out refinance on your vehicle. Compare the proposed payment to your current payments, if it's lower, then it's better for your DTI ratio.

If you don't have credit card payments, maybe just refinance your auto loan. Kicking it back out to 5 years, while hopefully lowering your interest rate, will help lower that payment.

*You can always pay your previous payment and keep it on the same schedule.*

# Use your down payment money to pay off short term debt

If you have saved up more than the minimum down payment for the purchase, consider using it to pay off some of your debts instead. By doing this you're switching your short-term debt to long-term debt. You'll have a higher loan spread out over 30 years vs the debt on a 5 or 6 year loan.

# Consider a different loan program

For self employed borrowers who show a loss on taxes but still make money, there are programs that utilize bank statements or profit and loss sheets to calculate your income.

# Haggle with your employer

Let's say your pay structure is one of the variable types, like commission, overtime, or bonuses, and you have a short time receiving it. Underwriting won't take into account that overtime unless you have 12-24 months. But they *will* take a salary. See if you can work out a salary that matches what you are really paid (hourly + variable income). On the underwriter's paper, your income just went up, even though you'll probably be making the same amount of money.

Also, check if your employer will give you a raise. Might as well.

These programs have higher rates and require higher down payments (Think 20%+)

# Select your lender

Congrats on making it this far! If you've started from the beginning, then you have a pretty good idea that you'll qualify, you'll have a good idea of the up front costs, and you'll have a solid idea of what the monthly payment could be. It's time to choose a lender and get that pre-approval letter.

A pre-approval letter strengthens the offer you make on a home. An offer that is contingent on financing (a loan) gives the seller a little bit of worry in the back of their mind. ""Maybe they won't get the loan"" so if you can give an assurance that the financing has been pre-approved, it will give you an edge over a competing offer that hasn't been pre-approved.

There are 3 different options you could work with in lending

* A mortgage broker
* A local bank or Credit Union
* An online lender

Here are some of the benefits of working with each of these:

* Brokers represent multiple lenders and have access to multiple options and rates
* Your bank probably has your checking and savings accounts. This could make some document gathering easier
* Online lenders offer technology and ease of online use

I'm a mortgage broker and help first time homebuyers secure their financing in a handful of states. I'm licensed in Utah, Arizona, Texas, and Colorado. If you've found this at all helpful, consider working with me. My NMLS ID is 1052267. [Here is where you can apply with me](https://integritylending.com/samuel-thompson)

# Getting pre-approved

Here are some of the documents you'll need to get pre-approved

* W2s for 2 years
* Pay stubs covering 30 days
* 2 months of bank statements showing the money for up front costs
* 2 years of taxes if self employed

You'll need a credit pull done, the impact to your score is minimal for a credit inquiry, 0-5 points.

>*A word about TRIGGER LEADS:*

>Well, when you get your credit pulled for a mortgage, the credit bureaus will sell that information to every lender that’s willing to pay. There are a lot of them willing to pay. A week before applying, go to [https://www.donotcall.gov/](https://www.donotcall.gov/) and register your phone number. This will save you the headache of 50 calls per day.

Once you're pre-approved, you may have to press the loan officer for more details. Ask for a breakdown of the monthly payment and the closing costs. Make sure it is in line with what you were expecting. Make sure you stay within your budget.

See if you can get a Loan Estimate. Some loan officers will not give a Loan Estimate until you've gone under contract. But some will do a TBD Loan Estimate. This is an official form that will help you compare other offers if you plan on shopping for the best rate. (More to come on shopping for the best rate.)

# Select your Real Estate Agent

This is what I keep in mind, and what I would look for in a real estate agent:

* The most experienced agent isn't necessarily the best
* Look for someone who aims to educate. You're a first time home buyer after all, you're going to have a lot of questions. You wouldn't want someone who gives short answers, expecting you to know it all.
* Look for someone who communicates well. This will be needed for clear and effective negotiations on your behalf
* Avoid a dual agent, or the listing agent of the home you're trying to buy. They will not be loyal to you if they represent both sides of the deal
* Someone who is full time. There are too many hobbyists and part time real estate agents who will have their time and attention split
* I would be wary of an agent that is brand new to the business. Who wants to test their first time home purchase with a first time agent? Any volunteers? This is an expensive transaction
* I wouldn't go with someone just because 'so and so' knows them. Did 'so and so' actually work with them? How was their experience? Did they check all the boxes?

**Where to find one**

* [Fill out this form](https://integritylending.tools/agent) or DM me if you need help pairing you with a pre-vetted one. One that I would work with.
* Check out online reviews
* You can always find a realtor at an open house. Talk to them as sort of an interview, see if it feels like you'd enjoy working with them

**A word about the NAR settlement.**

The settlement ended the practice of listing the agent compensation on the MLS (the catalog of homes listed).

The reason they agreed to that is because they wanted to dissuade real estate agents from only showing properties to buyers that had a high paying commission.

**My opinion**

I don't think much will change. Agents are asked to be more transparent with setting the commission. But the commission was always negotiable.

Sellers will likely continue paying for the buyer agent's commission. But you will want to be careful when signing agreements. If the seller of a property refuses to pay for a buyer agent's commission, you may be stuck paying your agent's fee. Luckily, everything is negotiable.

When you meet with your agent, make a list of must-haves (bedroom count, bathroom count, location, size) and then make a separate list of wants, but not deal breakers if it isn't there.

# Shopping for your home

I had a terrible experience ring shopping for my ex-wife. I visited 3 stores total. At the first store I was overwhelmed with the sales process and the price tag. The 2nd store was slightly less overwhelming. By the 3rd store I was done shopping and said ""let's just do this one"" and settled on a ring with a price tag double what I was planning for.

I bring this up because you may feel similar with the overwhelm, and if you visit too many homes, you may just make an emotional decision out of exhaustion or desperation.

The tips I can give you for this stage of the process are:

* Stick to your budget, or recalibrate thoughtfully
* Don't get emotionally attached until closing. You may love a home, but then discover some glaring issues that could cost you significant money or stress later.
* Don't make emotional decisions. Take a second after you visit the home and list your thoughts.
* Limit the number of homes you visit. This will help regulate your exhaustion
* Don't tempt yourself with homes above your approval limit
* Set up a listing alert with your agent. This will send email notifications every time a home enters the market that meets your must-haves

# Making an offer

You found a good one! Here's what writing an offer can look like. You can negotiate

* The purchase price
* Deadline dates (due diligence, financing, appraisal deadlines)
* The length of the contract. 30 days is customary, but do you need more time?
* Seller credits. Need to lower the total amount of cash needed at closing? This is a good way to do it.
* Repairs. See something that needs fixing. Put in the contract that the seller will fix certain items before closing.
* Personal items. Did you like the couch? Add it in the contract. Fixtures like curtains or blinds might already be drafted in your contract, but anything else, appliances, furniture, the projector etc. will need to be written in.

# In a competitive market

Are you making offers on multiple homes and getting rejected?

Either you're making low offers, or you're in a competitive market.

In a competitive market you and your team will need to approach offers a little differently. You'll want to aim at making less friction for the seller, and boost the seller's confidence in you.

Here are some things you can do to strengthen your offer:

* Have your agent call the listing agent BEFORE you make the offer. The agent might be able to glean what matters most to the seller, and then help you structure it accordingly
* Have your lender check for an appraisal waiver. If you are putting 20% down or more toward your loan, it may be eligible for a waiver. Appraisals can slow down the process. Waiving that piece will speed things up.
* Have your lender call the listing agent to further authenticate or endorse you as a buyer. Pre-approval letters are standard. A call from the lender stands out.
   * If the lender offers guarantees, use them. Some will offer ""Close on time"" guarantees.
* Play the emotional side of it. Get a letter typed up explaining how you and your family are looking forward to calling this home. Sellers might like the idea of selling to someone who will call it home, rather than an investor.
* Get even more creative. What is something you can offer that no one else can? Or something no one else would think of offering? Travel agents have offered the sellers a week vacation to any country in the world. Others have offered cookies every month for a year. I don't know how you'd enforce a contract like that, but points for being creative.

Brainstorm these ideas and anything else with your agent and lender to form a gameplan to help you win on your next offer.

Consider how competitive the market is. The seller will likely be looking for the best value, whether that be a shorter contract length, or the highest purchase price, or the least amount of resistance.

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,bonus invest,"I’m feeling overly anxious about my house purchase, am I going to be ok?","I just bought a house at 250k, that’s basically bare bones. It’s liveable, to the point that you can take a shower and there’s electricity but that’s basically it. So obviously I’m going to need to make a lot of investments into the property.

I fell in love with it, and after finding similar houses on the market for 550 and up I decided to take the leap of faith and “I’ll figure it out from there” and now here I am an anxious mess.

Luckily I’m very handy and have family willing to help me with the renovations so materials will be the biggest cost.

As I’m doing most of the work myself, progress will be slow which gives me time to save up for new investments. That gives me hope lol.

I’m living in Europe, but knowing how crazy many US taxes are I’ll just point out that my yearly taxes for the property will be 450 annually, so I’ve included them in “other”, which is basically savings for any bills, and savings is for me as an emergency pot in case something happens with work or whatever.

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,bonus invest,Buying vs. Renting- Is the mortgage feasible for Our Income?,"My husband and I are planning to buy a home this August when our lease is up. Right now, we pay $1,300 in rent, but our rental is being sold, so we have to move. The issue is that rent in our area has jumped to around $2,000, which makes us really consider buying instead.

We’re looking at new-build homes in the $375K–$400K range. Our combined income is about $110K before taxes, and we take home roughly $6,500 per month (not counting bonuses or overtime). By August, we expect to have around $20K saved. A lender quoted us a mortgage payment of $2,900, which would be about 32% of our income. We have no debt and both have stable jobs.

I’m wondering—does anyone else have a similar income and mortgage payment? How does it feel? It’s frustrating to think about renting for $2,000 when we could own for $900 more per month, but I also don’t know how realistic that is. The lender says we should go for it, but of course, they want that commission, so I’m looking for real-life experiences!

These homes would be a long-term investment for us—we don’t plan on moving again anytime soon. Would love to hear your thoughts. Thanks in advance!

Edit for more info:
We don’t have kids but also don’t plan on having kids for the next 5ish years. The 2900 payment is including all tax and insurance HOA Etc.

How do I do the math on buying a house? Ideally, I'd find out an all-inclusive number to compare against my rent. I can exclude home improvements and HOA for now. Once I find a house, how do I take that number and estimate how much the house might be worth in 20 years?

I'd love to be talked through some scenarios or something, and all the tools seem to give me ""yea you can do that"" but I'm worried they're underselling. Wells Fargo says I can get a 460k home, and coincidentally, it's within my rent and flexible dollars $3.4k/m. So, boom bang bam I buy a 450k home and hope for the best?

I need advice on a first time home buyer. I make 160,000 base gross pay, the amount factoring in bonuses and stock is 264,000 a year in a HCOL area. Now the house that I want to buy is 825k. A months pay for me take home is 9,000 dollars. My mortgage payment for this house would be 4,324 just for mortgage + around 500 for utilities. The rest I would have for expenses plus savings. The good news is that I am not including my 401k contributions to my take home as that is exclusive and I’m not considering stopping that. Finally, I haven been living below my means for a while, spending less than 3k a month to save up for this house. Would it be a good decision to buy this house with this financial picture? I want to buy now because I feel like house prices will only go up! What do you all think? 

One more thing, owning a home is very important for me, and I am more than willing to live frugally for a couple of years while my income catches up and my monthly payment goes down. I’m just not sure if it’ll be a good investment based on my financial picture.

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,bonus invest,Looking for opinions on affordability for a new home,"Hello, new poster here so hope this is the right type of question!

I currently live in a $400k house in south Austin and have built up $170k of equity. We’re planning to move to the cedar park/north Austin area to start a family and upgrade to a bigger home. My mortgage is very easy to manage and currently $2k and I add $500 to principal each month.

My salary is $215k and my wife is $65k but she may stop working by next year if we have a kid. I also have a discretionary bonus + stock around $85k a year (this would be our primary savings). Trying to figure out what a comfortable, slightly stretched budget could be for us. We overspend right now on trips, having fun but planning to slowdown and be more strict with our budget. I figure I can afford around $3500-4000 in a mortgage + taxes, interest. This puts us around - $500-max $650k budget for a house with a 20% down payment. I also have some investments I may throw down to ensure our payment is a bit lower. Also, we have no other major debts, car payments etc. 

I’m looking for real examples and opinions from others who are navigating or have purchased houses with similar budgets. Can I actually stretch to $4500 and get a $650k house? Should I really go more modest and get less house for closer to $500k? I’m pretty ambitious in my career but it will likely be a few years before any big increase in salary/TC. My wife prob won’t work if we have kids for 4-6 years so that saves on nannying but lowers total income. The whole point of moving is to be closer to her parents too so we’ll have that support. 

Another consideration is how stretched house prices already are. A $400k house is now $650k with double the interest rate. Should I just buy a home that we plan to stay in for a few years and keep saving up for the dream home down the line?

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,getting started investing,"First-Time Homebuyers (30s, $141k Income, St. Louis Area) - Advice on Affordability, Down Payment & Getting Started!","Hi everyone,
My partner and I (both 30) are looking for some guidance as we get serious about buying our first home. Our combined gross income just jumped to $141k this year (up from $73k while we were students), with one of us starting a new job this month. We're trying to make a solid plan and would really appreciate insights from this community.
Our Current Situation & Goals:
 * Income: $141k combined gross annually. We live in a LCOL state in the Midwest (Missouri) with state/city income taxes, sales tax, and property tax.
 * Debt: We have about $6,300 in credit card debt and $10,000 in student loans. With our new income, we're aiming to clear all of this in about 3 months by putting $5,000/month towards it.
 * Emergency Fund: We don't have a dedicated cash emergency fund right now. We do have employer-provided insurances (accident, death, job loss, injury, legal) that we believe would cover 6-10 months of our current spending ($2,400/month excluding HSA, or $3,000 including our $600/month HSA contribution). We're open to advice on whether a separate cash fund is still critical before buying a home.
 * Retirement: We've just started contributing to our 401k/403b this month, planning for $23,500 annually. Since it's May, this will be about half that amount by year-end. Employer matches are up to 5%, but vesting is 3-5 years, and we might not stay that long.
 * Current Housing & Future Home: We rent a 1-bedroom for $925/month. We want to buy our first home next year – aiming for a 3-bedroom, 2+ bathroom house, preferably with an open concept kitchen and a basement. We're looking in St. Louis County or St. Charles County, trying to avoid St. Louis City, East St. Louis, and Granite City.
 * Cars: We have one car (bought with cash). Commuting takes a lot of time daily (1.5-2.3 hours), so we plan to save for a second car and buy it with cash, but the house is the priority.
 * Banking: We're leaning towards using credit unions.
Seeking Advice On (Primarily for First-Time Home Purchase):
 * Home Affordability & Price Range:
   * With our $141k income, what's a realistic home price range for the type of house we want in St. Louis County or St. Charles County? We want to be comfortable and still able to save/invest a bit.
 * Down Payment Strategy:
   * We'll start saving for the down payment from this month's pay. What's the best place to keep these savings if we plan to buy next year (e.g., High-Yield Savings Account at a credit union)?
   * How much should we realistically aim for as a down payment in our target areas for the type of home we want? Are there first-time homebuyer programs in Missouri we should look into?
 * Mortgages & Lenders:
   * I've heard some credit unions, like Together Credit Union, might offer mortgage discounts or benefits to members. Is this common?
   * Can anyone recommend specific credit unions or local lenders in the Greater St. Louis area known for good service and rates for first-time buyers? What should we look for when choosing a lender?
 * Balancing Priorities for Home Purchase:
   * Our main goal right now is the house. How should we balance aggressively saving for a down payment over the next year with our debt payoff plan?
   * We also want to start some long-term investments (like in S&P 500 funds for goals far beyond the house). How do people manage saving for a near-term house purchase while not completely neglecting other long-term financial goals? (To be clear, any S&P 500 investing would be separate from our down payment fund, which we know needs to be kept safe).
 * Getting Prepared - Next Steps:
   * What are the absolute first steps we should be taking now to prepare for buying a home next year? (e.g., how soon to check credit scores thoroughly, when to start talking to lenders for pre-approval, how to find a good buyer's agent? Inspections? Finding an agent? Using Together Credit's Home advantage Vs Redfin or other platforms? etc).
 * Future Considerations (Briefly):
   * Long-term (10-15 years out), we dream of having a family-run real estate business. With this in mind, are there any particular things we should consider when buying our first home (e.g., potential for future rental, resale value considerations)?
 * Are there other benefits or tax savings we could get as first time home buyers? How would we claim them?
We're very open, excited to learn, and would be grateful for any constructive advice, personal experiences, or ""wish we'd known"" tips you can share. Thanks for helping us navigate this!

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,getting started investing,How bad is PMI?,"Context: So my boyfriend and I are both 23 and want to buy the home by this winter. We both work about 50 min from our home town (got jobs down here knowing this is where we’d move when we graduated college) and make about 120k together, we currently have 50k saved for a down payment. 

Problem is in the current market the houses we are looking at are in the 300k-400k range and my boyfriend is extremely adamant that we don’t start seriously looking until we have 20% for our max budget as he absolutely does not want pmi. I guess I’m just wondering what your experiences are with putting less than 20% down and how much that affects your payment? I can google all day long but ultimately I’d really just like to hear real home owners experiences.

(Also a p.s. cause ik some people get a little nervous about young unmarried couples buying a home together lol, we have been together for 8 years and are waiting to live together to get engaged because we’re both living at home with our parents to save money. I have a preference to not have to ask my parents if my fiancé can come hang out hahah)

Additional edit: 

looks like I have to add a few details regarding the relationship 
-we DID live together through college, 4 years. 
-if we do buy before getting married then we would take the proper legal precautions with a lawyer before coming close to closing on a house 
-our student loans are paid off
-he is an accountant for a large construction company, I am a first responder in a large agency. Both of our jobs have great benefits and high contribution to retirement. 
-we are both at the lowest pay we will be in our careers, I am already approved to skip a step in my scheduled pay scale in order to get to top pay faster. However, I only include our base yearly income. I work around 60-70 hrs a week, overtime adds a good amount. He has also been investing since he started working at 14. 

We are young, but this is not an impulsive thing for us to be looking into by any means

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,getting started investing,Seller may have just screwed us.,"I'll attempt to keep this short..

We are under contract on a house and our inspector found moisture and discoloration in the attic and ""mold like stains"" on the OSB. We made the mistake of requesting they have a qualified professional inspect/test and remediate the mold and install additional venting so it doesn't happen again. I realize now WE should have been the ones to send a company in because the seller found the most seller friendly ""mold remediation"" company on the face of the earth.. basically says mold isn't bad, it's all a hoax created by mold companies and that's definitely not mold and venting is perfect. 

I attached pictures of the dark spots(there are more than what's pictured) and the absolute joke of an inspection report the seller got (actually a pretty comical read if you're not me).  I admit the mold is not terrible and there wasn't bad smells up there so it's probably not a huge issue but this is a big investment and I just know we'll be remediating on our own and getting off on a bad start on our new home journey. 

Any ideas on some logical next steps would be greatly appreciated. I suppose we could request they allow us to send in a company of our choice but I just see them wanting to stick with their ""expert"". Or we could send our company to at least have an idea on what it's going to cost us as well as get a mold test done. 

I don't think we'll back out of the deal because of this but let this be a lesson to future home buyers. Don't let the sellers get their own experts!

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,getting started investing,I feel like I won.,"Sorry, this will be long. 

A month and a half ago, my landlord showed up unexpected with a realtor. I let him even though I had no prior notice since he lived a few states away. After he searched the house for damage, he informed me he was selling the house. We had rented this town house for almost 4 years. It came completely our of left field. But I told him I was interested in buying it. He never took good care of the place and I had been wanting to fix things for years, but not in my own dime. He kept the property ""functional"" at best. 

It's a 3 bedroom 1.5 bath townhouse in a highly sought area. Brick wood burning fire place.
The house had mold in the outside attached shed from a moisture issue that I resolved by unclogging ac drain line and cleaned up all the mold. The windows are original to the house which was built in 82. Ac is almost 15 years old but still runs well. The bathrooms and kitchen are all original minus the appliances. 

I manged to get pre-approved with no savings except what I had in my 401k (residential loan, so no tax fee.) The process has been a roller coaster. The sellers realtor tried to bully me into not getting representation for myself. She said they would sell as is for 170k and if I got a realtor, she'd list the property. I didn't feel comfertable going in this alone so I hired my friend who was a good realtor. The sellers realtor wanted him to kick us out and fix the place up, but the seller really just wanted to sell as is so he could move on to his next investment. 

We made an offer before it hit MLS. Then we got the ball rolling. We offered more than the 170 and then after 3 counter offers, we proceeded to buy yhr house as is and cover ALL the inspection fees. We highered the inspector, and kept the report to ourselves an let the picra expire so they didn't get a free inspection out of us. The inspection found several issues, but nothing that said ""runaway"". Then hired the termite and moisture inspector, all good. At this point, we were stonewalling by the sellers agent. 

My realtor and property manager work for the same firm, I got an email 2 weeks after we ratified saying the seller was giving us a 60 day notice, which was BS since our lease wasn't till up next year,  after correcting her mistake, she notified the landlord that she can't remove us In 60 days due to our lease. She also informed him that we had been working hard to move forward with the sale. All of a sudden, we start hearing from his agent again and the ball start rolling when we get our lawyers involved. Apparently his agent never notified him of any of our progress past ratifying the contract. 

Next big hurdle was FHA appraisal. We'll. Let's just say the property appraised for alot higher than the sale price and all we had to fix was some paint and a light switch cover. My landlords agent never thought it would appraise anywhere close to what it did. We are a few days from closing, and will buy our 1st home, only paying 40 more a month for our mortgage than our current rent. We don't need to move, or change my sons school in the middle of 5th grade. We will have an instant 25k in equity. My closing cost are about 5k. My wife and I put up with alot of bullshit, but my realtor said if they backed out at this point, they would be in breach of contract. 

I was really upset that even though we paid our rent on time for 4 years, he would try to kick a family of 3 out 9 days before xmas. But im trying to focus on the fact we are buying our 1st house in our early 30s, our housing cost won't increase all that much, we don't need to move and we will have a good deal of equity.

Best part is, their bullying tactics failed and even though they tried to take advantage of our ignorance of the home buying process, we made a call to advocate for ourselves and ended up being the winners here. I and a great team between our lawyer, inspectors,  lending team, and my agent who really fought for us. 

In closing, fuck this dude, his agent and the horses they road in on...But I can sleep at night knowing we indeed made the right move. I also forgot to mention I work full time and am gokg to school full time in my senior year for my BS in Cyber Security. So this headache hit me unexpectedly at the beginning of my semester. I still maintain a 3.94 GPA also...

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,getting started investing,Buyers remorse,"Context
6 months ago we bought a new house. We lived for 6 years in a spacious new apartment that met all our needs, but the older our daughter became, the more we felt the need to have a garden. 
Despite a nice savings, our region turned out to be overpriced/unaffordable: only houses to renovate were considered, but this really didn't appeal to me as I was put off by horror stories. I was happy to move to a region where you would get more space/value for money, but for my girlfriend this was not an option (work had to be accessible by bike).
After 2 years of active searching and some confrontational house viewings, we finally “had to” decide very quickly when purchasing our new home. 
We bought a house that has been completely stripped and renovated by a professionel real estate firm. For the first time, we had an immediate click upon entering - the house was stylishly renovated. The fact that the work had been carried out by a professional real estate firm and not a self-help person gave me 'false' confidence.

Regret
When this offer was accepted, I expected euphoria. Instead, I got buyers remorse and started doubting about everything. I hoped this was because of the stress of selling the appartment and preparing to move. But now that we are living there, I feel very unhappy, perspective-less, and I don't think this is going to change. Currently I am consumed by regret, shame, guilt and the continuous desire to turn back time. Constantly I check immo sites to find that we could have done much better with our budget. The grass seems greener on the other side, but the budget we had now seems gone and I don't believe we are going to be able to recoup it upon resale. My brooding thoughts and stress levels are going into overdrive, which makes me hope I'm not thinking clearly at the moment. Still, objectively I think I made a terrible decision. I would give a lot of money to be able to undo the decision.
PS: My partner is happy with the house though and tries to appease my brooding thoughts.

Online I read that buyers remorse is no exception and yet I feel very foolish. Normally I am very rational and think long and hard before important purchases, but the most important purchase I decided on 1 day. The house issues that are keeping me awake at night are mostly unchangeable, including overpayment, limited space and location. Selling quickly will result in a financial hangover and not an option for my partner either. However, the thought of having to stay here for a long time makes me very panicky. It feels oppressive to know that this is where all our savings are and that we will have to work for a long time to pay off this house.
I am now very much in two minds: there are still a lot of investments to make to make the house to our liking (garden, front yard, lighting, curtains...). Somewhere this will hopefully help me learn to appreciate the home, but somewhere I definitely don't want to overinvest in a home I don't want to continue living in.
Are these issues recognizable? Any advice? How have you dealt with this?",8,https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/comments/1m5d725/buyers_remorse/,1753085702.0,BlacksmithBoth1343,1m5d725,advice_seeking
FirstTimeHomeBuyer,getting started investing,I’m Tired,"Like all of you, my fiancé and I are first time homebuyers. We have been together for 6.5 years now (2019) and about 4 years in, we committed to our relationship and buying a home together. We test drove living together for about 2 years before coming to this decision. 

So as you all know, 2020-2022 was THE time to buy, largely due to the low interest rates. We unfortunately weren’t in that place in our relationship at that time. And with student loans, neither of us even considered looking into buying a house separately. When we started looking in late 2022, the interest rates were already starting to climb. I think they were around 4.5 by then but were quickly up to 5 then 5.5. In a 18 month time frame probably from Fall 2022 to Spring 2024, we looked at probably 15-20 homes and put offers on a solid 9 or 10. Initially we tried to stick true to our parent’s advice of never buying a home without an inspection, but as you all know, that went out the window. The strongest offer (that we still lost) was about 30k over asking with waived inspection and appraisal gap and 20k in earnest money. I mean we were all in. The house sold to someone who offered about 3k more I believe. The BEST part is that this house sold 2 years prior in 2022 for 100K LESS than the final sale price. Truly flabbergasted.

After that, we decided to take a break from hunting. We were angry, frustrated, and truly couldn’t take anymore disappointment. Each of our offers were outbid by a cash offer, a offer with more things waived, or an OBSCENE offer price 30-40k over asking (which was already inflated 100k compared to before the pandemic). It was defeating. And we were done with it. So we decided to stick with our apartment and just try to pay off student loans and grow our savings. 

Flash forward to now, we are in a much better place than before. We have about 30k more in savings. The market in our area seemed to have calmed down a little bit. And we were still just enjoying our apartment. LAST WEEK I was parking on the street behind us when I saw people moving out of one of the rowhomes. It was a cute one, an Airlite style rowhome, if you’re familiar. I asked around and found out that it was a rental and was quickly connected with the owner. Initially we inquired as a renter, but conversations lead to talk of a private sale. Both parties were quickly eager. He was okay with using our real estate agent as long as we would pay their fees, in return he would be flexible with the price. After multiple showings and comparable sale assessments, he started to become flakey. His home was very nice and well maintained but it was updated in 2004…and very much looked it. Homes of identical architecture style have been selling in our area for 330-370 the past year. Most recently a home with a more recent updated kitchen, updated bathroom, and larger backyard sold for $370. While it was a comp, that house was much much nicer. 

So he’s been flakey. We finally have our real estate agent sit with him again today to reach try to get a number out of him. He tell hers “yeah I really want to get $430,000 for it”. McScuse me??? Not a SINGLE comparable sale to that in the last 5 years in our entire zip code! However, in the last year a house on the same block but different style row (400 more sq feet than ours) was recently bought cheap (230k) ripped down to studs and totally flipped and sold for 499k. And that was SHOCKING. No one could believe it but they did add 1.5 bathrooms (2.5 bathrooms) and had all luxury finishes in the new kitchen and bathrooms. This place was NICE. You would have thought it was a new build when walking in. What was wild was that a similar home was flipped and solid in 2022 for only 365k. 

So back to our flakey owner. He keeps referring to this house, we will call it 260 Crab St, as a comp or that it inherently raises value. I’m in Philly. We have new 1.2 million dollar builds popping up next to 90 year homes all the time. And it does nothing for the old homes value. 

So our real estate agent (patience of a saint) tries to make him see the light. We were offering him 355k with zero commissions on his end. Which is comparable in value to selling at 375k with seller paying agent commissions. A super fair and honestly at the higher end of medial price. He hasn’t responded yet but when our agent suggested our offer earlier he goes “that’s unfortunate, I really wanna sell to them” 😶

Low hopes this will go through. I don’t think I could make him see his home value being 375 to make him be okay with our offer. But I just need closure and for him to reject it so we can move on.

But guys, I’m tired. I’m so tired. I’m tired of being 3 years too late. I’m tired of being outbid by investment banks. I’m tired of not having enough savings because I had 100k in private student loans to pay off out of school 9 years ago (which I was responsible and DID but it left limited excess for savings) I’m tired of these landlords thinking their homes are goldmines that are so much better than any other home sold of similar value, after they milked it for rental after all these years. I’m tired of everyone that I know who bought a home in 2020-2022 saying “wow we didn’t think our first home would become our forever home but our interest rate is just too good”. I’m sorry you bought a home that you “outgrew” with your one child and dog after 3 years. I’m sorry my siblings home values have double to tripled since buying in 2018. And if they were buying their homes now in the same financial situation they were in then, they would absolutely not be able to afford it. I’m tired of having listened to my parents and guidance counselors and did ALL THE THINGS RIGHT and still am in this situation.

I’m just so tired y’all. Everyone says it’s bound to get better but it’s been 3 years and it’s truly only getting worse. 

Every new build is 700k+. Bc the builders want profits just as much as anyone else. So when these homes pop up in our price range (300s), my fellow middle classers are forced to slice each others throats to get into one, while offering a kidney and our first born child at closing. We are pitted against each other, stuck in the never ending cycle of “selling high bc we’re buying high”. And anyone who doesn’t already own is just SOL. 

I’m just tired. And I want a front porch.",92,https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/comments/1jwg462/im_tired/,1744340823.0,humblePArtner,1jwg462,advice_seeking
FirstTimeHomeBuyer,getting started investing,When will interest rates go down?!,"My boyfriend and I have been house hunting since January and it has been disappointing to say the least. Our interest rate is falling around 7% and that amount is crippling. It’s not even worth it to invest into a house at that %. 

On top of that, even if we find a house within our budget, before we can even think about liking it we are out bid by $20k+ in cash. (We are not in a position to pay over asking and are looking for houses in the $200-$220k range). 

Although it is not life or death- we are desperate to move out of our parents’ house and start a life together. Constantly being disappointed everyday is getting old. 

When will the market get better?",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/comments/1femzxq/when_will_interest_rates_go_down/,1726093540.0,moneybond,1femzxq,advice_seeking
FirstTimeHomeBuyer,getting started investing,Down payment assistance programs for all 50 states (Part 1),"Hey guys, this took a while for me map out. This isn't all-inclusive, but will definitely get you on the right track. These programs might have changed rules from when I last investigated them. (I posted this a while ago elsewhere)

**I'll comment with a link that will help you navigate directly to the program.**

I might have made some mistakes on this as well, so comment if you see anything.

# How down payment assistance works

Down payment assistance can work a few different ways. Here are a few:

* A loan with active repayment (monthly payments with a higher interest rate)
* A loan that's due when you refinance or sell (deferred payment loan)
* A grant that's forgivable after a set period (5 years is common)

Some cities and counties run out of funds. So you'll need to check beforehand. A lot of these programs can only be handled by approved lenders.

# Common restrictions

Usually there are loan limits, purchase price limits, and income limits.

This can make it tough, because to qualify for a loan, you need a good amount of income, otherwise your debt-to-income could be too high.

But you can't make **too much** money or you'll be disqualified from the assistance program.

There's a box, and you might have a hard time fitting in it.

# Nationwide programs

There are lenders that have nationwide programs. They usually come with higher rates and higher closing costs, but if you're in a buyer's market (lots of inventory, not a lot of buyers) then maybe this can work.

**I'll comment with an easier way to navigate the programs, with links.**

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,how much to save,"Put an offer on a house for $340k, got outbid by someone offering $380k cash - how is this even legal and also I want to cry","Y'all I am SPIRALING right now and need some fellow house hunting warriors to tell me this gets better cause I'm about to give up and live in a van 😭

Found what I thought was ""the one"" last weekend. Nothing fancy, just a decent 3br ranch that didn't look like a murder scene or require me to gut the entire kitchen. Listed at $325k which was already stretching my budget but whatever, seemed reasonable for the market.

My brilliant strategy:

\- Offered $340k (15k over asking since I won some money on Stake, felt so smart)

\- Waived inspection cause apparently that's what we do now??

\- Had my down payment ready, pre-approval letter, the works

\- Even wrote a cute letter about how much I loved the house (cringe but desperate times)

Got the call yesterday that someone else offered $380k IN CASH and closed in 2 weeks. Like... who just has $380k sitting around?? Are these people drug dealers or what 💀

This is the FOURTH house I've lost in 2 months. My realtor keeps saying ""don't worry, the right one will come along"" but bro I've spent $1,200 on inspections for houses I didn't even get. My savings account is crying

The real question: How do normal people with normal jobs compete with these cash buyers? Should I just accept that homeownership is for rich people and crypto bros only?

My rent goes up $200 next month so staying put isn't really an option either. Feeling like I'm trapped in some twisted game where everyone else got the cheat codes

Anyone else going through this nightmare? Please tell me someone actually won a bidding war recently cause I need hope 😅",1560,https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/comments/1l3esg3/put_an_offer_on_a_house_for_340k_got_outbid_by/,1749065609.0,Glittering_Piglet192,1l3esg3,advice_seeking

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,how much to save,How much we spent on furnishing our home in the first year [detailed budget breakdown],"So I finally added up all the stuff we bought in the past year, and it turns out to be ~$17K. It’s not a 100% exhaustive list but I tried to capture as much as possible.

We did not spend $17K all at once, but spread over the year, on average $1-$2K/month, which made it a lot more manageable. Some items we kept from our old apartment so those are marked as $0 but I added a column with the estimated cost from when we bought them before. 

There were a few splurges on nice things, but majority was mid range budget buys (Target, Amazon, Costco, Home Depot), and a few were Facebook Marketplace finds. We still went to Restoration Hardware and other high end furniture showrooms for “research”. It made us feel a lot better for finding good deals or sales from cheaper stores. 

The first few months were stressful due to sticker shock at how expensive furniture is. And the long lead times for ordering furniture was very frustrating (some bed frames or dining tables we liked had 6-12 months wait…) we tried to buy stuff that was already in stock and would arrive within 2-3 weeks. 

For context we bought a new build so we did not have to spend any money on renovations. That helped a lot. We still have emergency savings just in case but it’s nice not having to shell out thousands of dollars on roof replacement or furnace or heater replacements. 

Keep in mind we are still not “done” furnishing. We don’t have any rugs, are missing curtains in several rooms, and have lots of blank walls to be filled with artwork. We’d like to eventually replace some of our old furniture and TV. We haven’t done anything with our backyard which is currently just all covered with mulch. But I’ve let myself not have any deadline for these remaining things, since they are just nice to haves, and I like the idea of slowly upgrading our living space over the years so we always have new ways of enjoying our home. 

Anyways, I think what we spent is probably on the higher end of what you could end up spending furnishing your home. But hoping this helps give an idea of the kinds of things you might be buying in the first year. Happy to answer any questions about stuff we bought or DIYed!",1306,https://i.redd.it/dtgow8w3y1zd1.jpeg,1730799020.0,Additional-Owl425,1gk2wel,not_advice_seeking
FirstTimeHomeBuyer,how much to save,How much to pad savings for initial purchase?,"So I'm nowhere near buying my first home yet, but I'm creating a financial plan to hopefully make it a reality in the next five years. 

My question is, how much should I be expecting to spend in addition to the down payment? I've tried to do some research, but I feel a bit over my head in terms of unfamiliar language. I know there are going to be several expenses throughout the process, but what are they and about how much should I be putting away for them in addition to the ~20% down payment?

For reference I'm likely going to be purchasing a 2 bed 2 bath condo in or near Kalamazoo, Michigan.

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,how much to save,"Advice for high, but variable income -- how to pick ranges, how much of total savings to put into a house, etc","Hi,

Me and my long-term partner, both mid-twenties (unmarried) are looking to be first time home buyers in the next ~9 months. 

We're in a fairly expensive area of the country, and would likely be looking at houses in the ~1 mil+ range.

My income is high, but heavily stock based and subject to fairly big swings.


 
Single income (base is currently 200k):

- 2023 250k


- 2024 700k


- 2025 probably ~500-600k?



Partner makes ~120k.

I have saved around ~600k in a brokerage excluding retirement accounts, etc. Expect this to grow ~200k by EOY.

Assuming I want to buy a house alone, excluding my partner's income, we're trying to figure out a couple of things:

1. Given my savings, what's largely the recommendation for down payments? Obviously can dump a lot of money, but I'm particularly worried about the opportunity cost of pulling out of the market & ROI time-frames/risk in real estate.

2. Paying a mortgage for a 1 mil+ house would be multiples more than our current rent (~3.5k -- split ~1.7k each) -- would substantially dig into our ability to save large amounts -- generally curious if you have any advice about what should we be thinking there? What ranges would you be eyeing?

3. Both from a lender / personal perspective, how is a highly variable/stock heavy income like mine treated? What should I be doing to hedge against changes here (ex. Stock vesting refreshers/market changes has the opportunity to reduce my income)


Really appreciate any advice here! We're hoping to connect with an agent/lenders in the next couple months, so still very naive on the processes here.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/comments/1kp8an2/advice_for_high_but_variable_income_how_to_pick/,1747530870.0,Foreign-Character-14,1kp8an2,advice_seeking

Our combined income is a bit over 200K, and DTI (no other debt) works out to just about 30%. It's manageable, and I expect a noticeable increase soon, although I am not assuming I will get it. I am recently done with my PhD working in life science, while my fiance is a nurse who has been saving while I studied.

Overall the purchase happened way faster than we planned.  We had over a year on our lease, so we wanted to just look around and learn about the process.  We started keeping track of what was in our price range, and eventually requested a showing on streeteasy - and ended up working with the agent that showed us the unit. (We were upfront that we were looking over a year in advance, he was happy to work with us. We interviewed another agent but were unhappy with his attitude.)

Only a few weeks and showings later we found the perfect apartment - there was no renovations to do, the condition was great and location was ideal. The price had just been reduced into our price range. The seller's agent had reached out to ours and asked us to make an offer, because they heard we were excited.  We put together a RENBY income/assets sheet and our agent sent an offer about 6% under, and settled in the middle just a day later. We were shocked, and began our rush to get all the documents. We went with the preferred lender for the building. Shopped the offer on fincast, but couldn't get a better rate.

Fun fact about co-ops that we learned is on top of the minimum 20% downpayment, they require between 1 and 2 years in mortgage + maintenance(tax)  payments to be available.  Since we learned this during the purchase process we are extremely grateful to our parents for some help with the post closing liquidity we were hoping not to ask for.

We went, against the advice of this subreddit, with the agent's suggested lawyer. He was competent, patient and extremely fast. If we were less rushed, I do wish I did some research in advance, but there were no problems. Our lender informed us we need to select a bank attorney (some rule changed), and our lawyer was able to fill this role as well. The lawyer did the due diligence, including reviewing board minutes etc. I also did a lot of research into all public information about the co-op, and reviewed the last few years of financials myself.

After we put our contract deposit, 10% in nyc, we were under contract pending board approval. We managed to get a board package (recommendation letters, balance letters, employment letters, financing etc) together before their deadline.  A short interview later we were accepted.

At this time we reached out to our landlord to begin the process of a lease break. (We were not too worried as the apartment is desirable, but still concerned.)  Amazingly, our agent found tenants to replace us - even though we didn't end up needing them, I am really impressed with this! Our agent had assured us it would be no problem finding a tenant, despite the long lease, but I didn't believe it until we found them.

We skipped inspection - it is typical for co-ops (we are only responsible within the walls, and the building is large and extremely well funded.)

With that hurdle out of the way, the only issue left was some infighting between the lender and the building insurance company about some policy document, but it was resolved without our input and we were cleared to close on time!

Here's our timeline:

Day 0 - Financial pre-qualification letter, make offer  
Day 1 - After counter, offer accepted  
Day 1 - Attorney retained  
Day 6 - Contract signed  
Day 8 - Appraisal (10K over!)

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,savings rate,It’s over,"TLDR: can’t buy a home. The dream is over. I’m not going to “fool” myself anymore and pretend like it’s possible. Going to accept this awful existence and move on. 

Edit: to everyone saying “just move somewhere cheaper”. Some of us have family obligations that require us to stay in a certain location. You cannot just assume that everyone can up and move to Nebraska to find a cheap home. It is not feasible for some people based on caretaking responsibilities for aging family members

My wife and I have finally had the realization that we will never own a home. The best chance we have is waiting until we’re 60 and our parents die, and we maybe get to inherit the home that they have (unsure due to siblings) and can live in it or sell it to buy a home of our own. Which is a very depressing thing to “look forward to”. 

It’s a very sad reality, but I’m done pretending it will work. It’s too stressful and demoralizing when the only thing in my price range is a 1/4 acre empty plot of dirt. 

I even checked if rates somehow went down to 3% right now we still couldn’t buy anything because the prices are just too high. 

How far has this country fallen where my parents were able to buy a home on a single public teacher salary, and my wife and I cannot buy a home with our two salaries combined?

Between rent, medical bills, and food, we can’t even save anything for a down payment, especially with how fast prices are still appreciating, even if we somehow saved $25k/year we’d still be “losing” versus home values.

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,build emergency fund,How much of an emergency fund did you have after moving into your first house?,"Just bought and moved into my first house but I'm delaying some of the furniture pieces and decor (dining table set, chandeliers and ceiling fans), as well as some projects (build a fence and screened in patio) because I want to keep an emergency fund.

Unfortunately my interest rate sucks, even with 20% down my CoL basically doubled ($3.5k PITI+HOA, also doing some lawn care subscriptions, etc.) so I figure after groceries and other bills/leisure/things I'm looking at roughly $5k per month to keep things going. And since owning a house is a bigger responsibility with more costly emergencies I figured 6 months worth ($30k) is probably wise to have on hand before putting extra into investments or wants. Thankfully my first escrow payment isn't till January so I should be good for it at this point, but just curious what rules of thumbs people on this subreddit practiced.",39,https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/comments/1gudjeo/how_much_of_an_emergency_fund_did_you_have_after/,1731958964.0,Bruthar,1gudjeo,advice_seeking
FirstTimeHomeBuyer,build emergency fund,I backed out of buying a house — the numbers just didn’t make sense,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share where I landed after going through the first-time homebuying process over the past few weeks. I got pre-approved, toured a bunch of homes, and even submitted an offer. But after going through the actual numbers with my lender and really thinking it through, I realized… I’m not ready.

Here’s what I was looking at: 
5 bed 2 bath duplex
	•	Home price: $369,000
	•	Down payment (5%): ~$18,450
	•	Estimated closing costs: ~$10,000
	•	Monthly mortgage payment: around $2,800–$3,000 (including taxes, insurance, PMI)

So all-in, I’d be spending ~$28K upfront, and I’d still be paying close to $3K/month in housing costs. That’s a lot. I currently rent for under $1,000 with a roommate, so basically paying $500 dollars for a 2 bed 1 bath apartment and while owning sounds great on paper, this felt like too much too fast.

What really got to me was the fear of being house poor — spending most of my income on the house and having little left for savings, emergencies, travel, or even just peace of mind. I also realized I hadn’t fully accounted for future repairs, furnishings, maintenance, etc.

I told my realtor I needed to cancel the offer. They were super understanding, and honestly, I felt immediate relief. I want to take the next year to save more, build a better cushion, and go into this process without as much financial strain.

Just wanted to post this in case anyone else is feeling pressured to buy just because you’re pre-approved or the market is competitive. It’s okay to wait. Owning a home is a big deal — and if the math doesn’t work, it’s not the right time.

Has anyone else done something similar and looked back without regrets?

Edit 1:
Thank you for sharing your thoughts and experience.
Just wanted to clarify I make about 140k per year and have been maxing out on my HSA 401k and Roth IRA every year. With that what I get in hand is about 4k per month. Spending about 3k on Mortage just doesn’t make sense to me. That’s why I backed out. Also if you are curious about my age it’s 30M

Edit 2:
All in this experience was really good because it told me I am not ready yet and what I need to do be ready. So I plan to save approximately 100k in the next three years to cover 20% down payment closing costs , maintenance and emergency fund.",184,https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/comments/1mdf3kk/i_backed_out_of_buying_a_house_the_numbers_just/,1753901660.0,Hot-Manager-3321,1mdf3kk,not_advice_seeking

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,build emergency fund,bought a house on a nightmare of a road,"In June of 2024 my wife and I were very close to expecting our first baby and were looking for our first house as well.  FWIW we did the whole Dave Ramsey thing and paid off all of our school debt during covid, saved up an ""emergency fund"" and then slowly build up our down payment of $80k as we knew we didn't want to get a mortgage too much over $400k

We are currently in Hyde Park, NY; my wife works here and I in Kingston and we really liked this side of the Hudson river more.  We started putting in bids we a very nice agent; we were told she was one of the best in the area.  Given the crazy market we were losing out to people paying way over market.  We finally looked at our current house for all of 20 minutes and put in an offer of $400k which was 25K over asking.  They showed it all weekend and then our offer was accepted.

Everything seemed great as the house was a one owner house that was built in 1974.  Little did we know how truly awful the road directly in front of our house is.  It is a country highway with an unposted speed limit; in NY that means 55mph.  This road seems to be used as an expressway for tractor trailers, dump trucks, school busses, crazy loud speeding cars etc etc.  To add to it there is a passing zone that starts directly in front of our house that every (expletive removed) thinks is their God given right to utilize regardless of how fast the car they are passing is going.  There is a traffic light less than a mile away.

We talked to another young couple across the street with a  baby slightly older than ours; we inquired about their fence and thought that was the ticket.  It's only approaching spring now so we could put up a fence but we've both had it (well more so me but we're in agreement) this road is an absolute nightmare and disturbs the peace of the cabin in the woods we really wanted.  I've never lived anywhere in my life where you cannot simply go for a walk.  I run to the corner (to a peaceful road I wish I lived on) where I made a 10k loop but that's a harrowing 1/4 mile effort as I have to jump in the tall grass if a vehicle is approaching as there are no shoulders.

Flash forward to yesterday, I emailed our agent expressing buyers remorse and she immediately replied kind of saying she understood and would help talk about plans to make it a short term ""live in flip"".  I have no intentions of trying to profit but just move on; it would be nice if we got a little boost out of it but not really necessary.  I understand I should've been more diligent on my research but I was quite busy and there was a ton of work to do just to get all the bank stuff lined up.

I've been reading many posts on reddit regarding quick flips and what to do in the intern when one sells and looks for another house.  I REALLY don't want to get into a rental as I may get stuck in a weird situation if no homes are available; I thought one option would be a short term AirBNB.  Everything is just a little tricky with a baby but she'd be two years old when it would be the soonest we could sell.

I'm just beside myself with grief everyday as I am kicking myself for overlooking the road thing when making the decision to buy.  To be fair I did know it was noisy but didn't have the day by day and hour by hour experience to go with it.  Our plan is to fix little things, clean up the outside, do some landscaping, fix the driveway and then put it on market.

I guess I would just like some insight on what others might do in my shoes.  I will be speaking with my buying agent after the weekend so I may have a better plan by then.  Thank you all for reading and maybe easing some of my concerns.

TLDR I want to sell the house I bought 8 months ago asap, I will wait 2 years minimum, but was looking for any and all advice of what steps to take

Thanks!

:)

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,build emergency fund,Why do people want to pay off their mortgage?,"We just bought our first home. I keep seeing influencers pedal “pay off your home/make an extra payment”. I just don’t get it - for me: 

Inflation Works in Your Favor
	•	Inflation erodes the real value of your mortgage debt over time.
	•	Meanwhile, your home likely appreciates in value, increasing your net worth passively.

Opportunity Cost
	•	Instead of throwing extra cash at a mortgage, you could:
	•	Max out a 401(k) or Roth IRA (with tax advantages)
	•	Invest in index funds, real estate, or a side business
	•	Build up liquid savings for emergencies or life events",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/comments/1kyml6e/why_do_people_want_to_pay_off_their_mortgage/,1748553677.0,rabbitbearpanda,1kyml6e,advice_seeking

Our gross combined is $130,000 and our salaries increase 1250 each year (2500 total). I also have the opportunity to make roughly $5500 more if I go back and get a one-year online degree. Basically, our income can/should jump up to $140,000 within the course of two years and will steadily, (yet slowly) continue to rise until we retire (we're in year 3 of 30). 

We have $40,000 saved for down payment/closing which will leave us a 10k emergency fund if we go through with it. We have a newborn coming in April as well. Also worth noting, we are building in a rural area, no HOA or anything like that, and my mother in law is taking care of our daughter for free, so there will be minimal childcare expense if any.

Here's the budget I've come up with - I would love another set of eyes to help see if I'm crazy.

# Total Essential Expenses: $5,314

# Remaining Income: $3067.65

# Net Household Income: $8,381.65/month

# What am I missing/failing to consider? I just feel like we're in over our heads and there's so much conflicting information out there. I feel like the leftover amount is plenty of an emergency fund/discretionary spending pot but I just fear I'm way off.

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,50/30/20 rule,Can I afford this house?,"Hi all, live in a VHCOL area.  We’re looking at a house that is $1.5M, our household income is about 450-500k annually.  That means our average take home net pay is about 22k per month, with an estimated monthly mortgage and tax payment of $10.5k.  

I hate the idea of spending 50% of our net on mortgage, but the standard 30% rule doesn’t seem to apply for this $ amount?  We will still have several hundred K in savings/invested after a 20% down payment, and have no debt beyond monthly CC bills.

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,50/30/20 rule,What rule for determining budget?,"I'm going crazy trying to figure out what we can comfortably afford. I'm seeing all sorts of conflicting guidelines. Some say 25% of net income, some say 28% of gross and no more than 36% on total debt, some say 50/30/20 split for needs, wants, savings. All of those get us wildly different numbers so how do we full determine what will be comfortable? 

About us: 2 income household- 1 set income 1 variable income. Total gross around $95k annually, $7,900 monthly, net around $5,800 monthly. 

the 25% rule puts us at $1450 but the 28/36 puts us at $2200 that's a HUGE difference. 

Our only other debt is student loans- $12k total, $172 monthly, other monthly expenses around $1600. We aren't big spenders but want to be comfortable affording the basics. 

Right now we are looking at a top budget of $225k which with PITI would put us at just under $2,000 a month. On paper it seems doable but the closer we get to actually submitting an offer at the top of the budget the scarier it feels. Am I getting shiny object syndrome and looking at way too high a budget or does that sound doable?

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,50/30/20 rule,Can We Stop Pretending Housing Prices Have Doubled Everywhere Since 2020?,"I keep seeing this narrative floating around “We missed the boat. Should’ve bought in 2020. Prices have doubled since then!” and honestly, it’s getting a bit out of hand.

Let’s take a breath and look at the numbers.

Yes, housing prices have gone up. In many areas, we’ve seen 30-40% increases. Some hot markets may have touched 50%. But doubling? That’s the exception, not the rule. If you dig into actual data, it’s clear this idea that the average home has gone up 100% in 4 years is a myth.

For example, take Phoenix as an example. Which is considered one of the hottest market post pandemic.  In 2020, the median sale price was around $320K. In 2025, it’s closer to $450K. That’s a ~45% increase. Substantial? Yes. Insane? Not really.

Sure, a few specific homes in extremely desirable locations may have seen huge appreciation. But broad claims like “everything has doubled” just don’t hold up. And even during the so-called “affordable” years, housing wasn’t cheap relative to income, affordability has been a problem for the past 20 years, not just since COVID.

If you’re in the market, don’t let the hype mess with your head. Do your research, look at comps, understand your local market, and block out the noise.

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,50/30/20 rule,Would it make sense to purchase a home in this situation?,"Hi all,

My significant other and I are in our early 30s and have been considering purchasing our first home but we are very unsure as to how to gauge what would be considered affordable without becoming house poor.

We live in a high cost of living state (Hawaii) and have been renting the same place since mid 2020.

Current rent: $1800 + Electric (\~$200)  + Gas stove (\~$40) + Water (\~$80). In terms of rent, it is a very good deal, everything nearby for rent for a similar space and size is easily 2.2k+ at the minimum. Since mid 2020 our rent has only gone up $50/month with the addition of paying for water which we originally weren't. Landlord is great, they are aware we are planning to look for a home and are willing to keep rent the same and roll month to month if we decide to sign/renew a 6 month lease (December - May).

We by chance happened to see a listing for a new build for a home \~$985,000 which is to be finished by the end of the year which includes up to $40,000 in closing costs on the sellers end. Median single family homes here are \~1.1 million and condos \~520k.

Pre-approval for a loan was completed and the estimated rate is ""6.125% at 3.125 points"" after buying down w/ the remaining closing costs. Estimated monthly payments of $5,420 (Principal & Interest $4800, Hazard insurance $150, Real estate taxes $285, HOA $186).

Combined yearly income of \~225k (\~120k + \~105k). Planning to split 50 / 50 for everything.  
Combined \~$11,900 per month after taxes & 403b, but Person 1 only contributing 3% to 403b and Person 2 only contributing 5% to 403b (3% match for both of us).  
Combined $380k in HYSA, \~80k in roth IRA, \~100k in 403b.

Job security is stable. No current health issues. No student loans or debts aside from recurring monthly bills (phone, car insurance, roth IRA contributions, netflix, HBOmax, spotify, amazon prime). Planning to have children in \~2 years.

We are on the fence on committing and worried about ending up house poor in the future after having kids / as HOA fees rise / unsure if we are contributing enough to our 403b to be secure into retirement. We have heard about 0.28 DTI (pre-tax income?) and 50 / 30 / 20 rules (post-tax income?) but am not sure if there are other ways to gauge this situation and would really appreciate some advice or guidance. We have only gone to this one home and haven't checked out / given a chance to looking at other properties which feels silly for such a major life decision. It is likely we end up purchasing a used home/condo if we don't secure this place as there aren't any new developments nearby in the upcoming year. It's just more so that this offer to cover closing costs and it being the last model of it's release left puts the pressure on. This development plans to make a mix of condos/townhouses/homes over the next 9 years but there is no official word of which order/timing of releases.

TLDR;

$985,000 new build home w/ $40,000 closing costs covered on sellers send.  
Planned down payment of 20% (\~200k).  
Loan: ""6.125% at 3.125 points"" after buying down w/ remaining closing costs.  
Estimated monthly payments of $5,420 (principal/interest, hazard insurance, real estate taxes, HOA) before utilities.

Combined yearly income: \~225k  
Combined \~$11,900 per month after taxes & 403b, but Person 1 only contributing 3% to 403b and Person 2 only contributing 5% to 403b (3% match for both of us).  
Combined $380k in HYSA, \~80k in roth IRA (maxed yearly), \~100k in 403b (Person 1 invests 3%, Person 2 invests 5%).

No major debts / loans. Planning to have children in \~2 years. Worried about ending up house poor / costs of children in the future / if we're not currently contributing enough to retire safely and would really appreciate advice or guidance.

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,pay off debt,Thoughts on paying off debt vs saving cash to prepare to buy a home,"Hi! I (28 F) and my partner (30 M) are trying to make a savings plan to hopefully buy a home in 2027 before getting married. Right now I make just over 6 figures and my partner has his own job as well. We currently live in Chicago and buying anything here is out of the question so I am working on convincing him to move back near my hometown in Ohio. You can get a pretty decent house there for around 300 - 350k. 

I am currently the one with a crippling amount of debt (my partner has none). I am not looking to hear people scream at me why or tell me I’m stupid, just understand I have 50k in student loans and around 15k in CC debt as well as 7k left on a car loan. I have a 401k but no savings account or Roth of any kind. My original plan was to put all my extra money into paying off my CCs this year (I’ve heard paying off a car loan is not good). My credit score is 699. 

Should I focus on paying off my debt and then try and save money in a HYSA? Or should I be doing a bit of both but then knowing I would still be carrying CC debt into meeting with a mortgage broker?

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,pay off debt,Can I afford to buy after paying off all debt?,"Hello, 

I want to start thinking of buying after all of my husbands and I’s debt is paid off. We were thinking of staying in the $350,000 range. We are in one of the more expensive states so that is as low as homes go around here. 
How realistic is it for us to be able to do this after all our debt is paid off? As you can see from the calculations below, paying off all debt would free up $1,022 a month. 

After taxes, and health insurance deductions,  our pay per month are: $5095 (we get paid biweekly so this is based off of our biweekly amount times 2)
Gross we make about: 98,000 before commission. 
 
Below is a list of expenses/rents, debts: 

•Rent: $2210
•Utilities: $160
•Groceries: $650
•Gas: $240
•Renters insurance: $19 
•Life insurance: $46
•Car insurance: $246
•iCloud: $10
•Ynab: $17
•Pet Insurance: $51
•Wifi: $75
•Phones: $77
Hulu: $27
•Natural Cycles: $10
•Haircut: $45
•Car tabs: $30
•Household: $20
•Personal products: $20
•Cats: $30
•Oil changes: 15 
•Magnesium: $26

•Credit Card: $169
•Credit Card: $77
•Credit Card: $59
•Debt snowball (extra goings towards debt a month) : $717

We have a total of $15,735 in debt which is scheduled to be paid off next year in October based off this plan. All our debt is 0% interest. 

Two side notes: 
1. I make commission too and that is not included in the pay I placed above as it’s not guaranteed and I have to work for it. My commission usually averages between $700-$2000/month pre-deductions. 
Our debt can be paid off faster due to commission taken into account. I am hoping it’s all paid off in the next 10 months. 

2. My husbands parents will be giving us money for a house down payment. Anywhere from $15,000-$45,000. 

3. We are wanting just a small house. No plan for kids. 

Thanks in advance!!!

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,pay off debt,Suggestions on how to close your mortgage easier. From someone who underwrites mortgages for a living.,"Just some tips that will help you avoid some of the pitfalls that can derail or slowdown your application. I have been the guy who decides who gets approved and what they need to send in for review for 30 years and I have seen it all. 

1) When you decide to start looking to buy, open a new savings account and do nothing but put money into it. Don’t use it to pay anything, EXCEPT your down payment (DO pay your deposit with a bank check purchased from this account). If something comes up and you must use the money to pay an emergency expense, withdraw it as cash and use your normal account to pay what you must. Reason: asset statements can be a minefield for surprise conditions. If I see payments being made that I cannot link to something on your credit, you need to provide proof of what is owed and that debt gets added to your DTI which makes your deal worse. If I see you have bounced checks, then your credit worthiness takes a hit, and if for some reason you had to be manually underwritten that could cost you the loan. If we see large deposits (generally 50% of your income in size or more or any that looks suspicious or looks like a loan) you will need to document where that deposit came from, and if where it came from is an asset with other large deposits or payments to debts not on credit then that opens another can of worms. So a clean savings account used to do nothing but save and pay the deposit will keep the surprises to a minimum. Note: do not provide any other assets but this account unless you miscalculate and don’t have enough in there. 

2) Do not open any Affirm, Klarna, Afterpay, or any of those buy now pay over 4 months accounts in the 2 months prior to application. If we see them you might need to provide proof of remaining terms and they can be added to your DTI in FHA loans particularly. And since these lenders work off of apps on your phone getting the documents the underwriting dept wants can be difficult. 

3) Don’t take photos of documents you send. Your phone has the ability to scan a document as a PDF. Google how and do this. Emailed photos can get hard to read if sent in “small” and you may need to resend the same document multiple times.  

4) Do not buy anything you don’t need on credit or apply for any new credit, while you are in the process of getting the mortgage. Inquiries can lower your credit score. And banks have systems in place to be alerted if you take out a new loan like a furniture or car loan before you close. I had a deal die the day before closing because the borrower bought $5000 in appliances at Best Buy on a new card and that caused the DTI to go over the max we allow. 

5) Don’t quit your job. I know this seems super obvious. But I have had multiple loans over the years be denied when we call the employer the day of close to find out they quit the day before thinking we would not find out. 

Finally) BE PATIENT. You are looking to borrow a huge sum of money. The rules banks must follow are specific and strict. Follow the above and it will reduce last minute issues. But sometimes things happen and you need to get another document the day before you close. Take a deep breath. Don’t stress. It will all work out. 

Good luck. ",413,https://www.reddit.com/r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer/comments/1k8qzkl/suggestions_on_how_to_close_your_mortgage_easier/,1745712525.0,CartographerDeep6723,1k8qzkl,advice_seeking

We pay off our credit cards every month and both have scores above 790 according to both Credit Karma *and* our banks FICO reporting.

I keep seeing Debt to Income Ratios pop up in my research. We aren't ready to talk to an agent to ask them yet, and I know regular debts like car payments, credit card debt, and other things all play into it.

We tend to pay for all expenses with our credit cards and pay it off every month to rack up points. I'm wondering if we need to stop doing that in order to have low statement balances and just pay with our own cash for a while before buying.

We regularly rack up statement balances around 2k. Phone bills, groceries, gas, etc etc etc. all stuff we could pay for ourselves, but don't for rewards purposes because we are able to pay it off.

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,credit card debt,New credit card opened just prior to pre-approval,"Hi everyone,

We just got the conditional approval from the lender. Then when I reviewed my initial loan doc, I noticed one minor/major discrepancy.  We opened a new credit card in September, and it just happened to not show up in the credit report the lender pulled for pre-approval in October. Therefore it's not listed on the loan doc either. We didn't open any accounts during the quiet period. 

In the conditional loan approval,  another inquiry was detected by the lender. And they required a explanation. That's another loan application after the pre-approval, which we decided to stop and stick with the current lender.

  
But the new credit line is not detected, still. I'm hesitant whether to report this to the lender. Our current credit scores dropped from the pre-approval due to 1) this new account 2) hard pulls during the loan process which might disqualify us from getting loan from any lender. I don't want the lender to pull my credit score again. They won't do that if no new debt is introduced with my understanding.

  
Meanwhile, I'm super worried that this could be found by closing anyways, when I have less time and will be more troublesome than communicating this with the lender right now.

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,drowning in debt,I did it. Started from the bottom literally 😵‍💫,"Yes I’m late but I needed a minute to process this amazing dream. I never thought it would happen… let alone as a Single mom right out of a marriage. Closed on a VA Loan January 14th at 7.5%(Discount of .25 with autopay) with $2000 down. Home price was $232,000  and seller paid all closing cost including $7600(4% of purchase price) in debts. I was also handed $3000 back at closing. 🤯 

I was drowning in a $2525 a month rental and now I pay $1801. To some the interest may be high yes but this is better than burning money in a rental. With the IRRL in my bullseye…. 🎯 I’ll be better in no time. I haven’t even paid my first payment and credit score has shot up 46 freaking points. If you don’t believe it can happen…. It can. 🙌🏾

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,drowning in debt,Buying a house with no money,"My husband makes good money.. we were once young and dumb.. got into debt.. it got pretty high with interest and we struggled for a hot minute. That being said, that “good money” is not shown IN his bank account currently because he’s been putting every single full paycheck he’s had to his debt for the last few months to crack down. Before that, we’d pay a good chunk OVER the credit card “minimum” each month but still drown because we were paying rent too and it didn’t leave much money left for the Snoop Dog high interest added to the debt. We lived paycheck to paycheck for a long time.

So lately.. now that we’re in a better spot in life.. better job the last *almost* 2 years.. more pay.. added $10,000 yearly bonuses spread out throughout the year.. constant crazy overtime.. and cards fell into our hands with temporarily living with family right now with no rent.. he’s been putting every paycheck lately to debt.. leaving us just enough for food, gas and, at the time, rent. Totally fine BECAUSE now it finally became possible to fully tackle that debt with huge chunks towards it and get ourselves ahead in life. 

We WERE drowning. Debt is now down to a few thousand and manageable for us to no longer drown. If we wanted to.. it could be paid off in probably a month and a half if we continue the trend we were on but we’re just trying to save money now rather than pay it all off and be left with literally $0 the next month and a half because of it all still going to debt. Of course we’ll still put $ towards it.. just redirecting our focus to saving for the time being. 

We’re thrilled and I don’t mean that sarcastically. I know to most of you, this still seems like a lot we owe but I promise you, from what we WERE at, this is amazing and we’ll have it paid off very soon. 

We ARE speaking to a lender.. he’s advised us that we need to switch our direction of finances here and switch to saving and leave debt as is for now until another payment is due and then put a chunk towards it. Lender said because credit score is great, debt is down to just a few thousand and not an issue for DTI (debt to income ratio), money coming IN is good.. that we need to now focus on saving.. he says we’ll be approved for what we want based off the info we’ve thus far given him. 

We are obviously NOT buying right this exact second.. we will take some time to save money.. but the house we want is in a little bitty middle of nowhere town.. a town my husband works near.. been on the market for a year.. low enough cost that we’d qualify. 

NOW….. through the pre-approval application to see WHAT we qualify for.. it’s asking for what is currently in my husband’s bank account 😭😂 which is basically nothing.. due to putting it all to debt. He’s paid weekly and paid well.. so yes, money WILL be in there very soon and stack up quickly.. about $1700 (after taxes) a week, sometimes $2000.. but right now, in our pre-approval, we can’t say we have much. Can we wait to submit until we have his next check? Yes.. but even then.. that still means we have like $2000 in the bank. I know this looks bad.. but how bad are we talking even being at about $2000 in the bank? We haven’t asked our lender this question because it’s middle of the night on a weekend night.. but I thought I’d run it across this community. 

The loan the lender thinks we’ll be approved for means we likely only need maybe 3-4% down.. our realtor is going to try to get sellers to pay the closing cost.. and we hope to offer a price that includes seller concessions.. all to help us.. so we don’t need $80,000 saved up or something crazy. I know we’ll need more saved up, I know.. but given my husband is paid well weekly, it’s easy to catch up and save money without things weighing us down like this debt that’s held us down for the longest time. Obviously we’d only purchase a house in our monthly price range.. and this house doesn’t have to be “the one”.. it just seems more probable for us given all we’ve seen with the house being on market a year, in a tiny town nobody wants to live in (but we don’t mind), affordable price in our range of comfortability, etc.. all assuming our finances are in check, we’re approved, inspector clears, etc. 

All the being said, long story to the end… is having very little IN the bank (for this minute) going to get us denied for the pre-approval until we get those savings up? We’re not trying to buy right this second.. this is just us seeing what we qualify for, what we feel comfortable paying monthly, based off the house we do like.. is it possible.. how much we’d need saved, etc. This is just us seeing what we’re working with and saving to reach that goal if we have time before that house sells.. and if it does, finding another one for a later time.

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,drowning in debt,Overwhelmed with anxiety,"Hi guys, I need to be talked down and given insight from the housing gods. I am a single woman looking to buy a house, I saw one I liked for 329k (bid 345k) in Michigan (middle of nowhere near Flint area) on 6 acres in the woods. It's remodeled and move-in ready, so hopefully it won't need big repairs anytime soon. 10 minutes from parents so I can mooch food.

I have zero debt, bought my car outright and put all of my money into student loans until they were gone as soon as I got a job. I own my condo and just pay HOA and taxes on it. My dad is letting me borrow 50k for down payment that I'll pay back after I sell (99k hopefully). Overall I will have at least 150k in down payment though before selling. So a 190k loan. After tax reassessment in a year those would be about 5k.

I am a small business owner and my monthly income varies and the economy is as such so I'm scared, but I've been working so hard at making my taxes and income look good so this is the year I can finally get a loan. On paper I believe I made 64k last year. So far my worst month this year I made 7500k (minus about 1700 every month for business expenses), and my best month was 12k. I pay myself payroll so that taxes are taken out each week.

I guess my fears are, can I afford a 190k loan 😅 should I be terrified to buy right now as a small business owner? So far I'm booked out to August and have been consistent for 3 years, but the what ifs are drowning me. I want to be closer to my family and start homesteading.

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,student loan help,Pay off student loan vs larger down payment,"
Hello

We are currently looking to buy a house. Fortunately, each of our parents are willing to help us in finance. I’m not sure what would be the best plan for us ahead, especially with recent student loan change. Here are some information:

- 37 Married
- Combined income: ~$160k
- Combined student loan: ~$320k, mostly mine. Currently under SAVE. Graduate loan with 6~7% rate
- Our current savings for house: ~$100k
- Gifts from parents: ~$300k

We were looking at a house that is about 800k house. (Housing in my area is crazy and not planning to move due to job site and family)

And here are the options I have in my mind:

Option 1: Pay lots more for 800k house (400k)
- High downpayment: less monthly mortgage 
- Switch to IBR and pay monthly towards 20 year forgiveness.
- Aware of tax bomb in future and plan to save to pay that. Afraid of the future where the forgivness goes away..

Option 2: Pay off the student loan.
- Either save more for downpayment by living in apartments (~$2500 a month) OR put small downpayment (I can put down small with doctor mortgage loan)
- high mortgage per month but free of mind of student loan and can invest.
- Sleeps better
- at 20 years mark, I would have less portfolio (~200k less) vs forgiveness route

Option 3: half and half and then pay loan aggressively.
- feel like this is the worst one..

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,student loan help,Student Loans and Applying for Mortgage??,"Hello,

  
I was previously approved for a mortgage back in June of 2024. I was advised by my mortgage officer then that my approval amount would be better if I find out how much my student loan payments are actually going to be. At that point, I was still in my Masters. I recently graduated in December and I am set to start repaying in August. I did file for a consolidation and IBR plan as I work for a non-profit. From what I gathered in my application, I would be paying around $250 starting on my student loans. I recently got a letter from Nelnet stating that my loans are in forbearance now because of what is going on with SAVE. I cannot find the document showing what I was 'estimated' to be paying and with now having to update my mortgage request again since we have not had luck finding a home we like in the time frame, I'm hoping to update my mortgage officer. 

  
The issue I'm running into is...what do I even provide to my mortgage officer?? My payment portal shows a $0 payment due. I did pull the mortgage document and it shows a payment of $1,084 will be my monthly without the IBR. Should I provide this only to my mortgage officer or what would others recommend? I am planning to talk to my mortgage officer but last time we spoke they told me they can go off a calculation but it's not always helpful of what the true amount will be. 

  
Please don't eat me alive on this thread haha. I will happily pay back my student loans, I just want to make sure I have all my ducks in a row.

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,student loan help,Student Loan or FHA loan first?,"Hi, I graduated with a bachelors in health back in '21 and have been fed up struggling financially so decided on returning to school to pursue an OT degree.

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,student loan help,Student Loans/Rocket Mortgage/ DTI / Lower loan amount,"Hi! So we submitted info for prequalification to several lenders. Rocket Mortgage came back to us first with a preapproval for 240k, which works for us.  
Then a couple days later, they told me they needed to update the amount to 208k because they verified info on student loans and dti ratio, and they said underwriting decided to use 50% of the student loans projected payments and debt - even when we proved it is in forebearance, and that we have been paying rent+debt+loans when it was required. Now they say I need to pay 8k in credit card debt, and we could get the approval for 208 -which doesn't work for us-.  
So we will not be working with them, BUT, my concern is if other lenders will consider that too later in the process and we won't be able to close on any deal. Obviously paying 8k would leave us without a bunch of cash we want to use to close. Also, 208 won't help us to close on what we want. We have been paying credit cards debt consistently, and our monthly rent is higher than what we could end up paying for the loan we want...  
Do you think other lenders will do the same math later in the process? I have submitted all the info they require, and mentioned the student loans, without any effect like that.

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,student loan help,Numbers hurt- how do you afford life?,"How do you figure out your budget for a house and actually afford it? 

I keep doing the math over and over again and between trying to get the down-payment to help lower the monthly, the actual costs of living is close to 6-7k a month between everything. I'm talking anywhere from food and car insurance to gas/propane/heating bill to the mortgage and student loans. 

I mean, that doesn't include trying to save for a vehicle+payment there or if you need a new couch or water heater or any of that maintenance, or enjoy a fun life like going on a trip.  Etc. Anyone who's middle class doesn't get the grants or assistance so then I don't qualify there. And down-payment assistance doesn't mean shit if you can't afford a normal house. My area a normal house is close to 230k. Which doesn't seem like a lot til you put all the numbers together.  And quite honestly it's daunting. 

Edit:  everyone has asked a bit on finances please see below for math based on the area I live in and the little bit of research I've been able to find for utilities and the costs associated with them. 

Based on the current math 
3.5% down for a 225k house at 7% for utilities I have rounded up to the nearest $50 to make up for costs rising over time (was told costs in area generally rise 3%, but was told theres a chance it goes much higher in the near future) (80 would go to 100, etc)

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,student loan help,Very disheartened right now,"My wife and I have been navigating the world of trying to get our first house. We have a plan, have a budget, have the land, and have a builder for a modular home. Construction loan, since its a new build.  

Our credit is great. Our reserves/savings are great. The thing to ruin it all: student loans. My wife and I applied for the SAVE plan under the Biden administration  which has been put on an indefinite forbearance until it can be ruled on in court. As such, our student loan servicers cannot require minimum payments, and we cannot show mortgage lenders how much we would be paying. In lieu of using those, they have to use the 1% rule: use 1% of our combined total student loan balance as a monthly payment. Since my wife is a doctor, she has a ton of student loans; and since we work in a rural area, our income is not very high. As such, using this method absolutely ballooned our debt-to-income ratio. We would only be approved for approximately 37% of the cost of the project. $136k, which in today's market is very, very little. 

The worst part of all is there is so little we can do about it. As the loan officer put it: either reduce debt, or increase income. We cannot increase income because it is limited by the area we are serving. Reducing debt would mean we would have to change repayment plans, possibly lose out on whatever the decisions may be regarding the SAVE plan, and possibly still lose money in the long  run by switching to a worse repayment plan.

My partner works at a credit union where employees get a better mortgage rate than anywhere else in town, our % would be 4.84%. We do qualify for down payment assistance however, he said that his credit union is out of funding for the year. Our agent said if we were to switch, we could qualify for $6k-$10k extra in a state housing grant (I am in South Carolina). Our agent is saying our $130k approval puts us into a bit of a pickle because a lot of homes (decent, move in ready, not in bad neighborhoods) are from $150k/$160k to well in the $200ks and higher. She has sent us a home for $185k that while is admittedly nice, I am not the biggest fan of it for a couple reasons, the price is by a ""very motivated"" seller she said but unless we could drop it another $25k+, we arent really interested in even viewing. Our hearts are on a home that is a little out of town, its $109k, needs some work. We fell in love with it.

We are in the process of looking to buy a house and shes expressed that she thinks we could up our loan and get a better house. I think we should stay within our original loan and use the inheritance to do upgrades. I see the point in her logic that we could just buy a ready to go home but my view is we make what we make and the inheritance will only go so far and a bigger more expensive house = bigger mortgage which makes me more nervous than I already am about buying a house. We're ready and finally can afford to buy a house, we've worked hard to save and I don't want to loose sight of still saving and living on budget just because weve been fortunate enough that her family member had enough to give money away after her death. Any advice would be greatly appreciated 🫶

Edit: My wife is the one who is getting the inheritance, we are first time home buyers so the whole experience is new for both of us. My wife and I have/are talking about all the options this was just to see if we weren't thinking of a different option, like a financial advisor 👌 we're not set on a decision yet as far as how we use the inheritance. I'll definitely bring up the retirement to her. We aren't too interested in a full on renovation more of like a redo on a wall/paint/minor renovations that we can take our time on.

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,ready to buy a house,Feeling Rushed to buy a house due to government help,"So recently, the department of housing of my country announced an aid for young people to buy their first time house. The requirements aren’t very restricted, the maximum of mortgage they offer to pay is $330k and the interest will be at 5%. Overall, an amazing deal.

However, I do not feel ready (mentally or financially) to have a house. I’m 25 years old and I just graduated from university a year ago. I’m single and have no kids. I have no idea where I will be in the next five years. I have always wanted to live abroad for a few years then return to my home country. I also planned to travel during the next five years and just live my life.

Despite the aid, housing is still expensive and I will still have to cover some costs. Plus let’s not talk about maintenance, furniture, kitchen appliances, essentials, etc. I will still be spending a LOT out of pocket. Money that I could use to fund my dream travels. 

But a family member is slowly trying to put pressure on me to buy a house. That it will be an investment. But here’s what I believe:

1. Buying a house that I would soon abandon in the future is not worth the investment. 

2. If I am investing on a house, it has to be MY house. I will not put my house up for rent so that when I return I throw the person or family to the streets. I will rather lose an arm than put a person/family through that. 

3. Rushing to buy a house (the biggest decision/investment of your life) when you do not feel ready should never be a good idea.

4. Having a house requires a lot of discipline. I do not have a partner to help me with chores. It will all come down to me alone and I still struggle with my one-room apartment at times.

I know the aid is a GREAT help and that in a way I will be super dumb not to take my chance. But unlike many other young people with partners and kids, I do not need a house at the moment. I am happy with my one-room apartment. I can move freely as I still discover and explore what to do with my life as a young adult. 

Still, I would like to know what you guys think. Am I being stupid or are my feelings valid in not wanting to rush such a big decision in my life?

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,ready to buy a house,[GUIDE] How to Buy a House with No (or Very Little) Down Payment in 2025,"Hey everyone,

With house prices and the cost of living being what they are, the idea of saving a 20% down payment feels impossible for most of us. It's often the single biggest thing holding people back from buying a home.

I put together a detailed guide breaking down the *real* ways people buy homes with little to no money down. It's not a myth; there are specific government programs and strategies designed for this.

Hope this helps anyone feeling stuck!

**TL;DR: Yes, you can buy a house with $0 down. Your best bets are a VA Loan (if you're military) or a USDA Loan (for eligible suburban/rural areas). If you don't qualify, you can use a Low Down Payment Loan (like an FHA loan with 3.5% down) and combine it with a Down Payment Assistance (DPA) grant from your state to cover the rest. Always weigh the pros (buy sooner) vs. cons (higher payment, no starting equity).**



# ## The True $0 Down Options



If you qualify, these are the two holy grail loan programs for buying a home with absolutely no down payment.



# ### 1. VA Loans (For Military Members)



If you have served in the US military, the VA loan is hands-down the best mortgage you can get. It's a benefit you've earned.

* **Who's Eligible?** Active-duty members, veterans, and eligible surviving spouses.
* **$0 Down Payment:** You can finance 100% of the home's price.
* **NO PMI:** This is huge. You don't have to pay Private Mortgage Insurance, which can save you hundreds each month compared to other loans.
* **The Catch? (Kind of):** There's a one-time ""VA Funding Fee"" (usually 1.25% - 3.3%) that gets rolled into your loan. However, veterans with a VA disability rating are exempt from this fee.
* **Credit Score:** The VA doesn't set a minimum, but most lenders look for **620+**.

>



# ### 2. USDA Loans (For Suburban & Rural Areas)



Don't let the ""rural"" name fool you. The USDA loan program covers 97% of the US landmass, including tons of suburbs outside major cities.

* **Who's Eligible?** You must meet income limits (can't be a high-earner) and the property must be in a USDA-eligible zone. You can check both on the USDA's website.
* **$0 Down Payment:** Finance 100% of the home's value.
* **The Catch?:** You pay a 1% upfront ""guarantee fee"" (rolled into the loan) and a small annual fee that acts like PMI, but it's usually cheaper than FHA's.
* **Credit Score:** Most lenders require a **640+** score.



# ## Low Down Payment Options (3% to 3.5% Down)



If you don't qualify for the above, the next best thing is a loan with a tiny down payment. You can often get this covered by a DPA grant (more on that below).

* **Conventional 97 Loan:** Only **3% down**. This is a great option for people with good credit (**620+**). The best part is the PMI is **cancelable** once you hit 20% equity.
* **FHA Loan:** Only **3.5% down**. This is the go-to for people with lower credit scores. You can get approved with a score as low as **580**. The major downside is the Mortgage Insurance Premium (MIP) is usually for the *life of the loan*.
* **HomeReady® / Home Possible® Loans:** **3% down** loans for low-to-moderate-income buyers. They are a type of conventional loan but come with reduced PMI rates.



# ## The Secret Weapon: Down Payment Assistance (DPA)



This is how you turn a low-down-payment loan into a NO-down-payment loan.

DPA programs are run by state and local housing agencies to help people buy homes. They give you money to cover your down payment and/or closing costs. This assistance is usually:

1. **A Grant:** FREE MONEY. You never have to pay it back.
2. **A Forgivable Loan:** A 0% interest ""silent second"" mortgage that is forgiven completely after you've lived in the home for a set number of years (like 5 years).

**How to find them?** Google **""\[Your State\] Housing Finance Agency""** to start. A good local lender will know all about the programs in your area.



# ## Is a No-Down-Payment Mortgage a Good Idea?



It's a huge opportunity, but be realistic.

* **Pros:** You can buy a home and start building equity *now* instead of saving for years while prices and rent keep rising. You keep your cash for emergencies and moving costs.
* **Cons:** Your monthly payment will be higher because your loan is bigger. You start with zero equity, which can be risky if home values drop in the short term (you could be ""underwater"").



# Your Action Plan:



1. **Check Your Credit:** Aim for at least a 640 to have the most options.
2. **See if you qualify for VA or USDA first.**
3. **Research DPA programs in your state.**
4. **Talk to a LENDER.** Get pre-approved to see what you can actually afford.
5. **Build your team** (lender, real estate agent) who has experience with these loans!

My wife and I are in the process of looking for our first home and currently shopping for lenders and idk it is starting to make me feel like is it all worth it? I am currently renting a townhome and everyone I talk to is like “You buy a home so that you dont have to worry about rent increase every year” okay.. but doesn’t property taxes do the same thing? Or “buy a home so you dont have to worry about sharing a wall with someone” okay.. I haven’t seen or heard my neighbor in a year. Or “if you buy a house you can have a yard for your dog” but there is dog parks everywhere.. Or If something breaks in my townhome I have a maintenance guy who fixes it as I am not forking out 5-10k. Or “do you don’t have to worry about someone telling you what to do” when there is literally HOA neighborhoods that tell you what to do.

Like I want to buy a home because me and my wife will have kids soon but damn sometimes I wonder if it’s a society “American dream” move or is it really going to pay off as I prepare to drain my savings account.

I rather get out of this offer. I told my boomer parents this and they think renting is a bad ides despite me showing them the rent vs buy calculator and how we are actually losing money over a 10 year period by buying in our area. Also our lifestyle will change significantly for the worse.

The told me if I don’t go through with it I have to give them back the money.

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,buy vs rent,How come people rarely talk about the taxes you saved when owning a home vs renting,"e.g. the deductibles like mortgage interests , mortgage insurance, property taxes, sometimes qualified energy related improvements , moving cost, closing costs etc
I also think car insurance would be cheaper when combined with homeowner insurance from most insurance providers

Utilities rate could be locked in for a longer period with a lower rates vs a yearly contract because you own a house

Most time people just analyze rent vs own on the face values

The taxes saved could be invested also

Most YouTubers are just saying buying a house is too expensive now, money invested in stock market has better yields etc etc

Also when owning a house, you are paying for a lifestyle , that hopefully one day pays you back

The way I see it is 
Financially speaking
Renting is like driving a beat up Honda 
Owning a house is like driving a Lexus 

Sure Beat Up Honda is cheaper in the short Run

Though Driving a Lexus that would build equity overtime, saves you some Taxes, offers better lifestyle could be a much better choice ? 
And hopefully 1 day you would also get all the money you put into it back thru appreciation (long ass time) 
And hope that by the time you sell, your proceeds get fully exempted from being Taxed. 

(Totally legal, by the way)
and how many ways could someone make hundreds of thousands of dollars Tax free in the US? Thru homeownership you would have a chance

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,buy vs rent,What's the point of buying when it's likely cheaper to rent?,"I'm in a medium cost of living area (New England, about 90 minutes from Boston). Been considering buying, but with the state of the market ...not sure it's worth it.

Affordability is not an issue (would need to borrow only about 20% of the total), but running the numbers through NY Times rent vs buy calculator:

[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/upshot/buy-rent-calculator.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/upshot/buy-rent-calculator.html)

\- suggests that I'd save about $18K/year by renting vs buying. I've been going out and looking at a bunch of rentals and for sale properties - can basically rent the same house for $3500 per month vs buying for around $700K - same neighborhood, same layout, same condition.

Assumption are that houses and rents go up at %3 per year and I stay in the same place for 7 years. It gets worse if I everything stays flat and I have to relocate in 3 years - would loose about $45K/year. It's also possible that housing goes through another inflation spiral, but with the rates staying high and the economy cooling off ...I would not bet on it.

I can fix stuff and do maintenance if I need to, but I also don't want to do it if it's cheaper to let somebody else take care of things and not have to worry about selling when I have to move.

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,buy vs rent,Rent vs. Buy Dilemma: Is This $800K Condo Worth It?,"I make $270K a year and am considering purchasing an $800K condo with a 20% down payment. The best mortgage rate I’ve found is 6.875%.

I'm pretty set on this area, and prices aren’t likely to drop. However, no matter how I run the numbers, buying feels like a poor financial decision. My main motivation is to get more space than I currently have in my rental, but I could simply rent a larger place and still save a significant amount of money.

With 20% down, my total monthly payment would be around $6,000. While I could afford this, I’d be financially vulnerable if I lost my job, and I wouldn’t have the flexibility to renovate for quite a while. On the other hand, I could rent a more spacious place for $4,000 per month, which would be much cheaper.

Running a rent vs. buy calculator, I’d need to stay in the condo for over 10 years just to come close to breaking even with renting, and about 15 years to fully justify the purchase. The amortization breakdown is even more discouraging—out of the $6,000 monthly payment, only $600–$700 would go toward the principal in the early years.

When we do find something nice, it sells very fast.

Those houses are much nicer and are more move-in ready. I don't mind fixing up a house, but I don't wanna buy something that needs massive repairs within a couple of years like a new roof or foundation work. 

I combined my wife and I's gross incomes together and added up ALL our expenses and debt. That includes monthly grocery spending, 401k contributions, health insurance from our paycheck, fed and state taxes, credit card debt, car payments, subscriptions like Netflix, and even a couple hundred a month for recreational or personal spending. 

After all that, we have roughly $2200 a month leftover. Combined we make about $82k a year. 

That number shocked both of us, it honestly felt so much lower. After this I bumped my search filters to $225k and the options are much nicer and more plentiful.

I spent my 20s & 30s living in cost-prohibitive large cities (LA, Chicago) and I was also not really interested in settling or investing in property. I’m now working/living in a popular Southern costal vacation town in which I could never afford to buy a house…

Sooo I decided to buy a second home* (for myself but also for my dogs, see below) before buying a first home! I know y’all will have many hot takes and notes for me 🙃

I grew up spending summers in this area. I LOVE being in the mountains so so so much. I’ve always dreamed of living in the mountains and in early May, I was doing that thing where you scroll Zillow in areas where you could never afford a house…But wait, wait- this little place is actually…maybe possible?? I could do that?? Should I do that???

I was in the area for work and I reached about a showing. Figured I wouldn’t hear back, but I got a message the next morning and scheduled a walk through. I genuinely loved the agent and felt immediately comfortable with him and I LOVED the house and the area. 

It felt crazy, but I decided to move forward. And it all felt SO meant to be throughout the whole process! Like, everything happened so easily, felt so positive, it just seemed like the Universe was saying “You’ve been through a lot, this is what you need.”

(*This is where some of the rationalization comes into play: I have 2 Newfoundlands who cannot handle the summer heat where I live. It’s currently 95 there and it’s 77 here. So we can escape here in the summers and they will be soooo happy.) 

It was a seamless process and took 45 days from first walkthrough to closing. I saw the property 3 times and had everything inspected and tested. I got approved for FHA, but the sellers only wanted conventional. I negotiated having the sellers cover all the closing costs which was SO HELPFUL. That was $10,000 that I didn’t have to spend outright. It also came furnished, so that was helpful— it’s 95% stuff that I don’t want, but I can spend time here immediately and swap out stuff over time and make improvements over the next 2 years. (First thing is to have it painted a very dark green)

Yes, I will still rent in the city where my job is based. I do not plan to move here full time. I can work remotely quite a lot and have a loose in-office schedule, so I can spend a lot of time here. I don’t currently plan to rent out the mountain house, but that could change. Once I’ve done some light renovations, I might consider making it available to rent, but would prioritize family and friends being able to spend time here (no or low cost). 

To close, I’m an active, solo woman who reads more like a woman in her mid 30s. I have worked so hard my whole life. I love my job and I love working, but my work is demanding and very social- I am so happy to have an escape. I’ve been married, I’ve had a long-term partnership, but being solo at this stage is not where I thought I would be in life. That said— I have always been very independent and I am SO PROUD OF MYSELF for doing this on my own. I am so happy 😊 I can’t wait to learn so many things about owning a home in a rural area and in a rainforest!! I can’t wait to learn how so many new skills like building a security gate, power-washing, replacing a vanity, installing cork flooring, and sooooo much more! 

Happy to answer any questions! And I’m sure there’ll be feedback, but I hope most of it is nice :)  Congrats to everyone who has jumped into homeownership- it’s quite an adventure!!

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,afford a house,32M 0% Down 168k 6.25% My VA Miracle from Applied to CLOSED In a Month,"TL;DR:  From loan application to closed on my house in less than a month and the reasons why it was possible.



my now former roommate and his significant other decided they wanted to get their own place, so I started to search for a roommate to take their place. That search failed spectacularly, so for shits and giggles, I applied for a VA home loan. I finished the application and I received a phone call but five minutes later, telling me I was preapproved for up to almost 200,000.  I couldn’t believe my ears.

I let my loan officer know from the get go that if I find a home that will work for everything that we need we need to move on it immediately or there is a strong possibility of me ending up homeless, because according to many places, I cannot afford to live by myself by their standards, and my lease ends July 25 at noon. 

I jumped at the chance and started searching for homes, after looking at a few different places one way overpriced for the amount of work needed and would never pass a VA appraisal and a fantastic home listed way under what it ended up going for I found one in the middle put it in offer for asking price and it was accepted.

After an expedited loan approval process that went so smoothly they made everything just come together for me and after passing every hurdle, every goal being met, I succeeded.  

I took possession of the keys today and a week later turn 32 years old, I was somebody who never thought they would own a house before they saw the age of 40. Yet I get to call this place my home. After years of struggling it’s nice to win some. 


Sorry for the essay this has been a month in the making, and I’ve been waiting for the day I got to make my post.",5267,https://i.redd.it/6ax9zh78v2ff1.jpeg,1753474257.0,Pews_N_Pull_Starts,1m99jhu,not_advice_seeking
FirstTimeHomeBuyer,afford a house,"After six years in a 450Sq Ft Studio and a significant income increase, I (30M) decided to utilize my VA Loan and finally get a house by myself! $666,100 4.75% Paid $168 in total to close","Is a new build, paid for solar outright so that is included in the cost, somewhere around the range of $15,000. House appraised at $712,000 3 bedroom 2.5 bath 1945sq ft with a 300sq ft California room, 8100 sq ft corner lot in a culdesac, with a massive park being build right next to my house a few years from now. The end of my culdesac will have a direct path/access to the park. 

I honestly never thought I would be able to afford to buy my own home but with the help of the VA loan, that dream finally came true. The first person in my family to own a home, high school dropout, now work as a Systems Admin, put myself through school and decided to pursue nursing so am currently in school for that as well :) 

Girlfriend currently won’t be living with me but once her lease is up we have discussed her moving in :) This entire closing process was stressful, but the builder did buy down my rate 2.25% and paid ALL my closing costs and all other fees associated. I work for the subcontractor that does their hvac and plumbing. Unfortunately I didn’t get a trade partner discount of 2-5% like most other builders offer but either way I feel like I got a really great deal and a beautiful home.

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,afford a house,Does anyone else feel like people who bought their house before 2020 are out of touch with reality?,"I live in a MCOL area that before 2020 you could get a 3 bed 2 bath in good condition and a nice area for like 150-200k. Things blew up during Covid and now the absolute floor for anything commutable and not in a sketchy area is 500k now. This area is still a MCOL area, it’s nowhere near SoCal or NYC, but it is significantly more expensive than before. I bought my house about 6 months ago for 500k. I pretty much live on the outskirts of the city in a not cool area, though my house is in good condition. 

I have talked to some people on Reddit and IRL and I feel like they really do not understand what it is like to be facing today’s interest rates and prices. People guffaw at me when learning that my mortgage is in fact $3550 per month. They tell me that it is outrageous and that I should downsize, when that is financially just not possible. It’s always someone who bought their house for 1/4 the price 5-10 years ago 🤡 Gone are the days of  cheap houses where I live. 3k mortgage payments are the norm now in my MCOL area. 

Has anyone else run into this issue?

Edit: I love how most of the comments on this post are from the annoying people I’m talking about 🤡 don’t worry guys, I just feel fortunate that I at least make enough to afford today’s home prices.

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,afford a house,Can we comfortably afford a $385k house on $140k salary AND start a family?,"My wife (31) and I (29) are looking to buy our first home later this year and would love a gut check on how much we can realistically afford without becoming house poor.

Here’s our financial snapshot:

* **Household income:** $140,000/year (pre-tax)
* **Cash savings:** $94,000 in HYSA (we’re comfortable spending up to $80,000 on a down payment)
* **Investments:**
   * $112,704 in retirement accounts
   * $138,794 in taxable brokerage
* **Debt:** $400 car payment, but will be paid off in a year

We're looking to start trying to have a kid in about a year, and I'm estimating around $1,500 in childcare costs.

We're thinking about putting an offer on a house for $385k with around $6k a year in property taxes. It seems do-able to me, but I'm not sure how uncomfortable this will feel once we have a kid.

As of now, without having a child, it looks like we'd be around 24% DTI. I'm a saver by nature, so this is scary, but I also have lived in shithole rentals for awhile now, and really want to have a home we can enjoy and grow into.

I am looking at buying a home but the only ""real"" option in my county or in any of the counties surrounding my county is a 313k townhome with a 300 a month HOA. I make 45k pre-tax per year and can reasonably save 25k a year due to no living expenses. I don't really leave home because the cost of doing stuff in (Tampa FL) is relatively high.

FirstTimeHomeBuyer,down payment savings,Finally saved enough for a down payment but my boyfriend insists on new construction only - Austin actually has way more options than I thought,"been lurking here for months while saving up and finally hit my down payment goal last week (!!!) but now dealing with my boyfriend's weird thing about previous owners. He refuses to look at anything built before 2020 because he's convinced every older house has ""hidden problems waiting to bankrupt us.""  
I thought this would basically kill our chances in Austin but holy shit - there are actually 1,300+ brand new homes available right now: [https://www.houzeo.com/homes-for-sale/texas/austin/new-homes-for-sale?utm\_source=reddit&utm\_medium=social&utm\_campaign=firsttimehomebuyer](https://www.houzeo.com/homes-for-sale/texas/austin/new-homes-for-sale?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=firsttimehomebuyer) I was expecting like maybe 20 options lol.

  
The more I'm looking at them though, the more I'm starting to get why he's being so picky. No weird previous owner modifications, everything has warranties, modern layouts that actually make sense for how we live. My anxiety about ""what expensive surprise is hiding in this house"" has basically disappeared.  
Plus with Austin's tech scene, a lot of these are clearly built with remote work in mind - dedicated office spaces, good internet infrastructure, etc.

  
Anyone else end up going new construction for peace of mind? The prices honestly aren't as crazy as I expected compared to buying something older and having to renovate/fix everything.

My husband is a smart guy financially and mathematically, but this is not adding up to me.  He has even made me an amortization vs. investment growth spreadsheet aiming to prove his point that paying an extra $1000 a month toward our 30 year, 2.5% mortgage is worth than the alternative. 

If I can take that same $1K per month and put it in an index fund at 6% growth, over 30 years, how can that not beat out a 2.5% interest rate?  


Edit:  Wow, thank you for all the thoughtful responses.  This I never expected and really appreciate the feedback.  There were a lot of themes, I’ll summarize:

- Mathematically speaking, investing in market or risk free makes more sense financially 
- A 2.5% mortgage rate is cheaper than inflation 
- Liquidity is better than tying up the money
- Don’t forget about the psychological benefits of being debt free, there is intrinsic value in this
- Many suggested a 50/50 compromise which is a great idea
- If you are not staying in the house and moving somewhere with a higher rate, best to spend the money there

RealEstate,invest $1000,Beginning to feel like accelerating mortgage payments isn't best,"Hey Redditians,

I'm retiring in four years.  I'll soon have some serious cash in my budget to throw at my home mortgage or rental property mortgages, all of which are about 60% to 70% paid off.

But I had a thought exercise:

The year is 1950 and you're a Vampire.  You're going to live forever.  You buy a house for $5,000 (they are cheap because it's 1950).  But you're not rich, so you arrange with the bank to only pay interest on it.  You pay tax and insurance through the escrow part of your payment (it comes to $100 a month because these are the 1950s).    Time passes. now it's 2025.  You still owe $5,000 on your house.  But it's worth $200,000 because you kept up the maintenance (at night).  Your payment (tax and insurance) is probably around $600.  So for $600 a month you get to live in a $200,000 house.  Luckily, as the years rolled by, you also invested $50 a month into the stock market. ...money you didn't spend on the mortgage to pay off principal. That portfolio is now worth $2.4 million.  So there you go....Your net worth is $2,595,000.  Vampire makes good.

Now real life.  I make a mortgage payment of $2100 a month, and about $1000 of that goes to principal.  The loan is at 4.5%.  I owe around $160,000 on my palace.  If I just keep making payments, in 4 years I'll owe around $95,000 when I'm ready to retire.  Now if I kill myself paying extra over the next 4 years, I might be able to whittle that down to a balance of $45,000 instead.  When I make those payments, I estimate that about $700 is going to escrow to service tax and insurance.   So when I retire, I'll have to pay $700 a month even if I sold my coin collection to pay it off in full.  What if, instead of doing either of those I just refinance it?  I would just failthfully pay the mortgage (but no extra) for 4 years leaving a balance of $95K, and then refinance for 30 years.  The P&I on that refi would only be about $400, so my payment would be around $1100 including escrow.  My payment drops from $2100 to $1100, saving me $1,000.  Instead of paying $700 a month forever, I pay $1100 a month.  I still would only owe $95K on the house and that would drop slowly.  And I'm sure I could grow money quickly in the stock market to take care of that remaining balance anytime I wanted to.  Here's the thing...a $400 difference looks like a big deal now.  But 10 or 20 years from now, that $400 difference might only buy a loaf of bread...time makes that P&I payment look small.

So I've concluded that after I pay off my smallish debts over the next year, I'm just going to stuff as much money as I can into the 401K, and then right before retirement, I'll refinance my house for 30 years. My wife and I both have pensions and social security that will comfortably service the estimated $1100 mortgage payment.  I won't rush to pay off a rental property either. I'll just throw as much money as I can into a 401K until I retire and then I won't touch it until RMDs start to complicate my life.  My 401K (actually a deferred comp but I don't want to confuse people) has a Roth option, so I'll step that up.

TLDR...maybe instead of hustling to pay off a mortgage before retirement, we should just throw that money into investments and refinance right before retirement...especially if you're a vampire.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1iqx26q/beginning_to_feel_like_accelerating_mortgage/,1739726147.0,Steveasifyoucare,1iqx26q,advice_seeking
RealEstate,invest $1000,"Considering new build in Laveen, Phoenix AZ","Hello all, me and my partner have been wanting to be homeowners for years and we have worked and saved up for it. We currently live in Ahwatukee and notice that the new builds are offering the most bang for the buck, we can get a brand new home being offered at a 4.5% bought down interest rate and the new home builder will pay to help break our lease, we love our apartment complex, the area and management, we have no real complaints, the rent is very affordable as well. 

I work in East Mesa and she works in Tolleson. It's a 5 bedroom 3 bathroom house and has a guest suite with a seperate entrance and kitchenette for 490k, we are planning to travel for work to see the US in the upcoming years as I'm a union electrician and we don't know what our long term plans are, we originally planned for Oregon or Washington state, but due to family and friends we will likely be here long term. 

We make currently 180k combined and plan to rent out the guest suite for atleast 1000. The PITI is 3060 a month. We really love the home. 

The Laveen area we arent too familiar with, the house will be are genuine home and we will view it as an investment and rent out the guest suite, and we will be leaving the familiar and convenient Ahwatukee area to go there, my partner she does work in Tolleson so she's decently familiar with the area. 

Any comparable home in our area is very old and we would get much less home for something that is risky, as repairs and less efficency for the heating and cooling come into play.. 

Anyone familiar with the Laveen area? Is it worth to step into homeownership in this regard from a financial viewpoint? We would go from 1650 a month to 3060, no debt, DINKs, no kids, take home around 10000.

RealEstate,invest $1000,Townhouse in Browns Point WA,"I want to buy a house. I now realize this will take several years. 


I’ll justify this later but first I have to talk about the home I toured this previous weekend.

The property in question is a San Francisco style townhouse located in the darling neighborhood of Browns Point, WA. Nestled on Puget Sound, this community boasts incredible views of the water with abundant boating access and a walkable neighborhood. The location is desirable and gives access to the literal best elementary school in the Tacoma zip codes, a 30-minute commute to the airport, and a secluded environment from the “grunge” Seattle is famous for. Purchasing the specific property also grants access to the locally renowned “Browns Point Improvement Club” which includes a clubhouse, exclusive park, beach, and private boat ramp.

A bright and sunny day in May 2025 is when I set eyes upon the house. I had high hopes for this property when I first arrived - on paper things looked great. I’m chomping at the bit to purchase a home. This attitude is currently in vogue amongst my generation so it’s possible I’m buying a bit too deeply into current investment fads. 

I admit the thought of housing investment is attractive. More importantly I crave the state of “owning” my home. Something I’m responsible for, a place to grow and care and experiment with. I’m a handy guy, I enjoy working on houses.

I greet my real estate agent and walk into the house. The agent is the owner and tells me about the new flooring installed earlier this year. They tell stories about the same renter for the past 20 years. It’s a darling space, 3 bed 1.5 bath at ~1200 square feet. My partner is excited with this place and speaks of growing together here. 

I’m having fun now. I’m planning out where my major furniture will rest in the rental and what my evenings in this neighborhood will look like. I’m imagining our future dog playing in the public fields 2 blocks away from the property. Then I find an issue. The exterior siding of the property is made of plastic. Vinyl siding to be precise. A cardinal sin in the Pacific Northwest, the only acceptable materials for siding in this region are Cedar and Cement. Vinyl is doomed to bend and warp in our hot summers and leak water in our exceptionally wet winters - 40 inches on average in Browns Point. Mix in the annual ice storm and the material the builder pinched pennies on is now costing the current owners tens of thousands in repairs.

My realtor asks if I am interested in the house. I tell her I am, she’s offering me a good deal. I tell her I need the HOA documents to review before we can continue considering this.

She sends them over - it would probably be better if she sent me a red flag.

Two years ago the HOA monthly dues were $250/month, in the current year the dues are $375/month. I look out for additional oddities - I notice the insurance deductible skyrocketed from $5,000 to $25,000 in one year. In another vein, I find that the current budget proposal predicts $1000 in “collections fees”, yet by August the association had overspent to well over $9,000. 

“Wow!” I thought. No way in hell am I getting mixed up in this. My curiosity is piqued though. I decided to chase the lead on collections fees first. 

My first thought is this: “What the fuck are collection fees? Surely it’s free to send money to the HOA”. I quickly released this had to do with legal fees for a collection lawyer. The $8,000 spike in costs is the standard story of a tenant withholding dues and getting evicted. 

I chase the story on the insurance spike and it confirms my suspicions. Eleven properties (of a total 49) in the past two years have needed siding repairs. My information is incomplete as well - I only have  records as recent as July 2024. This explains the property insurance deductible increasing by five times. 

I look at the reserves and this is the nail in the coffin. “Healthy” reserves are about 2.1 million and the HOA only has ~$550,000 in its bank account. This property is bleeding money on siding repairs and legal fees. The siding issue will never go away either, the only way to combat this issue is to replace every inch of vinyl with an appropriate material. Truly a shame, the HOA definitely cannot afford this. 

The HOA must continue coughing up cash for weather damage, the insurance company will continue to raise costs on the structure (because who wants to cover this property?) and the tenants are none too keen on paying their dues to fund this racket.

It’s a shame, the property is in a great location. I know I need to start my homeownership status with a starter home, though I feel this place is better described as a ticking time-bomb. If the current trends continue then the HOA will run out of money to cover repairs and the tenants will be left high and dry. 

It’s certainly possible for the association to recover from this. It will take a good amount of work.

Work that I’m not willing to do.

So my hunt for a house continues. I realize now this isn’t going to happen easily. Time to improve my timeline, I was hoping to buy a place by July of this year. My next installment will talk about how I realized this just isn’t a good idea.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1kxitu9/townhouse_in_browns_point_wa/,1748443260.0,PNWhousehunter,1kxitu9,advice_seeking
RealEstate,invest $1000,Home Improvement Questions,"We might be selling our house in the next year. It is 60/40 stay/sell.

The reasons don't matter - there is no exigent factor that requires either decision. It is kind of a love-it or list-it scenario.

Our current house is lovely - our neighborhood is coveted (houses sell in under 90 days when they take up to 270 around us). Our house is the 'cheapest' on the block of high-end, executive homes.

Our house was also the first build on our sought-after street, so we have been working on replacing the 1998 vibes since we bought it 10 years ago.

We would like to do some improvements -  that I want to start planning to do or just do, now. We have already modernized our roof, windows, door and fully painted the house in a more modern color scheme inside and out (very well done, to the point that people coming to visit us drive past our house thinking it isn't us).

It has tons of curb appeal - if when it looked less than fantastic in in 1990's hues.

I'd like some help to organize the improvement list to just prioritize spending and time - but also with highest return on investment toward the top of the list, so that if we do sell, it has at least some repayment. We will enjoy all of these improvements, so I'm really looking to optimize for \_potential\_ resale to just drive up square foot valuation, which our market does support, especially as the cheapest house in the nicest neighborhood.

Details: a farmhouse-style, 4 bedroom, 3 bath, 3000 sqft  + 30x15 large room-over fully hvac'd garage spare room and partially finished basement in 1000 sqft of the space. We use the room-over-garage as a 5th bedroom but that technically only counts as extra space due to being under a hipped roof area.

Yes, I will be working with a realtor at some point. We just don't know if we are ready to do that yet.

Here's our list:

1. replace our garage doors with insulated, carriage-style doors (this is actually #1 on my list) - question is do I get a)  'best' door that has three-layer (steel, foam, steel), R-18.4 with wood look, steel carriage-ish door - these still have the obvious garage door panel. b) Or, would a full-out faux carriage door four layer (still wood-look steel, we live in the NE and I wouldn't do a wood door) but that hides the garage door panel.
2. Kitchen Countertops - replace high-end orginal laminate with

* granite?
* quartz ?
* corian (not favored in our area, but I love corian)
* soapstone (my second fave)
* marble ?

1. resurfacing cabinets - our cabinetry is high-end and could be visually improved - I would consider doors and or professionally painting. \*\*I will move before living through a kitchen remodel/cabinet replacement. Seriously, that is my line in the sand.
2. Full master bedroom ensuite redo/redesign. Our house was designed by its builder to showcase his building, not designed - so our master bedroom windows look into our neighbors garage (they keep it much neater than we do ours!)  - and our WIC and master bath take up the full scenic view of our densely wooded, multi-acre private lot, and we have four doors in and out of this space. I have a plan, on this, an architect lined up to do stamped drawings, and would GC this with trades myself (have done this before). Square footage would not change - storage, reducing doors
3. Leave the ensuite setup as is- Master bathroom redesign. Ugh our bathroom is horrible c 1998 - awful jet tub that I would gladly host a bonfire in, just poorly designed.
4. install 2 egress windows in basement and fully finish about half the basement - will not take much - rough out of electrical is done - plumbing access is in place for a 1/2 or full bath. This is below grade so it would not be a full-valuation improvement, but would be able to be counted as 'finished basement'
5. laundry room improvement - kind of like a California Closets optimization to make the space more functional - includes a laundry Chute (which I love, but not sure if it is desired or a detriment)
6. replace upstairs carpeting with  hardwood -either in hallway (about 30 lf of hallway) OR hallway and bedrooms
7. improve bathroom 2 & 3
8. replace septic system retooling - we have it cleaned and inspected (always passing) on the regular. It is just aged; and they fail. And, our state is eyeing this up as public health opportunity. Redoing it could support upgrading us to a 'legal'
9. outside rear yard improvement - currently our rear yard is basic, trees, fire pits, functional gardens that we don't really do much with. We could get a hard/landscaper in and make it wow - but is that worth it? currently a nice large deck with slider. I always envisioned a large bricked patio with shelter; just have never done it.
10. complete landscaping of front yard to remove and redesign walkways away from house, tear out and replant a 15 x 40 kidney shaped tree garden.
11. raise the roof over the garage (the roof is seperate from our main roof, so this would not require a complete reroofing or look bad due to the existing separation) to capture the full over-garage square footage adding in about 450 sq ft of above-grade living space.

Would love some expert opinion on prioritizing these of projects - in terms of potential payback if we sell (again, these are the things that will happen over the next few years anyway, if we stay - I will be happy with any of them, and if we go want to make it worth the money and time as much as possible).",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1ftzjs9/home_improvement_questions/,1727817858.0,anony-mousey2020,1ftzjs9,advice_seeking

RealEstate,invest $1000,"Lakeview house $125k, low income town. Potential to have 4 apartments. Good investment?","So I have the opportunity to buy a house with views of the Lake and mountains for $125k. It's in a low income country town, it's not on the lake, but has views. It's a duplex, with 1 side redone 7 years ago. The other side is completely gutted. There is potential for 4 apartments, all with lake and mountain views. 

There is a massive housing shortage around here, with most towns being destroyed by airbnb. I personally HATE airbnb, and plus there are incredible towns all around us, that travellers would stay in rather than my town thats in way, run down. And I'll be honest, the locals I would get could get scary. Lol

Within 30 minutes drive, are 3 different hospitals. Travel nurses are ABONDANT around here, as every town now is half air bnb, and there's no local workers. 

I really think this could be a great investment and could make great money with the travel nurse thing, with maybe one local who would literally pay the mortgage with $1000 rent. Every town around here is also just getting nicer and nicer, and my small town, being right on the lake, we will be next for the money to come in.

RealEstate,invest $1000,"Lending vs ownership percentage mismatch, and income from an investment property","This is actually three questions

The first is this - we have 4 buyers on an  investment property, which we will need a mortgage for.  What are the advantages to having multiple people apply for the mortgage together if one of the person's income is sufficient to qualify?  It seems to be a disadvantage because then every borrower will have that hit on their credit report, right?  It's not like if 3 of us applied, and the mortgage is $3000/mo, it would count as $1000/mo for each, but rather $3000/mo for each if we were to apply for another mortgage individually later on.

But that brings up the question of, if only one of us is on the mortgage, isnt that more risk for the one person who is on it?  How do people typically deal with this?  I guess the owner with the mortgage is considered to have a larger percentage ownership?  For example, if a property is $1m and the net income is $10,000/month, and one person takes the mortgage for 300k + contributes 200k, then they'll receive $5k a month.

Finally, is it perfectly okay in the eyes of the tax man for two people to own a property but for just one person to claim the rental income from it?  For example, say I own one with my brother, we each have 50/50, but I let him collect all of the money and he reports it all on his taxes.  I assume this is perfectly legal?

RealEstate,small windfall,Unique financial situation + no W-2 income: how to go about applying for large mortgage in 2-3 years?,"**Background:** I'm looking ahead to applying for a potentially large mortgage in 2-3 years and want to make sure that I'm setting myself up for success in advance so as to minimize surprises when the time comes. As I'll lay out, my financial situation is somewhat unique. For the purposes of this conversation, I'd like to assume that my financial situation in 2-3 mirrors my current situation. Obviously that won't be the case, but I'd prefer to do so for the sake of simplicity and wrapping my head around certain considerations.

**Current net worth:** \~$3.95mm comprised of $3.6mm in equities and $350k in equity on my current home.

**Taxable income reported on most recent 1040:** $550k

**Credit score:** 800+

Now for the unique parts:

* Of my taxable income, \~90% comes from income derived from shares in a family S-Corp. The business is quite old and established, having been owned by my extended family for 75+ years. However, despite the taxable income that is reported on my return, I don't keep this money. Instead, the company makes periodic after-tax ""special distributions"" that I get to keep. The amounts vary from year to year and I cannot count on them in any given year. It all depends on the health of the business and our strategic priorities. All this being said, my tax return looks like it belongs to someone making a huge salary when the reality is not quite that.
* The rest of my taxable income is a combination of dividends and income from a small business that I own outright that currently generates \~$100k per year. The small business flows through my Schedule C (i.e. I don't pay myself a salary via W2.) I do not have any W-2 income.
* Of my invested equities, \~$1mm sits in an irrevocable grantor trust that I am the sole beneficiary of.
* Also, among my invested equities is \~$500k invested in a publicly traded fund, held at an EU brokerage.
* Not included in my net worth is the fair market value for the shares I own in the family business. These shares are highly illiquid and are valued at roughly $1.4mm as of our most recent valuation in 2024.
* I am also listed as JTWROS on a brokerage account belonging to my mother worth \~$600k. This is not included in my net worth above.
* My only real debt is my current mortgage, which I would close out upon selling my current home, which has appreciated modestly. I'm not factoring in the modest windfall I'd stand to make if/when I sell it.
* If the bank includes the FMV of my stake in the family business as well as the JTWROS account, my net worth looks more like $6mm.
* I would also likely be applying for this mortgage with my partner. We are not yet married and her net worth is negligible (maybe $100k), but she has a salary that hovers around $160k annually. Her credit score is also 800+.

**My question:** Realistically, what would be the upper bounds of the sort of mortgage we might qualify for? I'm mainly concerned about the fact that I personally don't have any W-2 income. I'm also wondering if the nature of my income as well as the trust that makes up \~25% of my NW might be frowned upon in the eyes of the bank. I'm also wondering if the $500k invested overseas may be a red flag as well. I'm happy to answer any questions you might have.

RealEstate,small windfall,Oppsies ,"So just moved into our new home and having buyers remorse that's it's too small.   :(.   

The big problem for me is we have a 1 year old son and he will need to attend school at some point (4years from now)...my question is, to the real estate gods....we have about 70% (windfall from a condo I bought in 2019) equity in our home so we are well insulated to market shifts.  (Like, if the price halves, we can still sell without having to right a check) if we decide to sell in 4 years (it would really be 3.5 till we would think about listing) to move to a less expensive community and a larger home, is that a black mark on the house?  

I know the idea is always choose the location over the house and we did, but I just really think we screwed this one up. We picked the best school system and in a cute part of a nice town, but, man, it is small.

RealEstate,what to do with extra money,Just had our offer accepted and it had a very troubling home inspection. We decided to walk away from the purchase. Did we make a mistake?,"Hello,

We recently were in the process of finalizing a purchase of a home after some significant negotiating back and forth. Yesterday was the home inspection. We paid extra for it because we wanted a thorough inspection and it was a complete and utter disaster. The seller had disclosed mold in the attic as well as a leak under their kitchen sink as the only two major things wrong with the home. Apparently the mold was ""fixed"" 4 years ago. When our inspector made it up there he snapped 4-5 pictures and showed us immediately. There was mold on about 80-90% of the entire attic. Every board, joist, and insulation was covered in mold. He also found a few bait bags in the attic. On top of this, early on in the inspection he opened a floor vent and discovered it was an old school ""transite"" vent. Transite vents contain asbestos and he showed us the layer of it. Not only this, it also had mice droppings and an active mouse trap inside. The sellers did not disclose any of this in their disclosure statement. This was very troubling, but we tried to remain positive as he continued. However, as he dug deeper he uncovered multiple spots of the ceilings showing active leaks as well as more mice traps scattered throughout the home. There had to of been a dozen of them throughout. When we went to the open house none of these were out. We even found a trap under the sink which had significant warpage. It's like everywhere he went he uncovered more issues. There was an active roof leak in 3 spots of the home, a crack along a wall outside that could indicate a foundation issue. We tried to stay positive but the costs were adding up insanely fast, and was well above a what a seller could offer as a remedy. 

We went from potentially moving into the home of our dreams to a nightmare in a manner of 2 hours. The sellers seemed absolutely shocked and the listing agent even requested a copy of the inspection when we asked to pull out of the deal. It's possible they thought the attic problem was solved, but there is no way they didn't know about the active mouse traps. We didn't feel comfortable having them do any repairs considering how the mold remedy was unfixed as indicated on their disclosure statement 4+ years ago. We are devastated but feel the best solution is to simply walk away. The seller could offer a significant amount of money to remedy the issue but we just don't feel comfortable enough to move forward.

 Did we make a mistake walking away or was this the right decision?",1398,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1kbwfht/just_had_our_offer_accepted_and_it_had_a_very/,1746061151.0,AintNoBuffet,1kbwfht,advice_seeking
RealEstate,what to do with extra money,"Closing date is today. We've signed, but buyers are refusing to sign escrow papers.  What next?","EDIT 4:

Update for yesterday: We still had not hear back from buyers, so (yesterday) our agent had us sign the termination paperwork and sent it to the buyers and their agent and their agent's brokerage.  A couple hours later we received notice that the buyers are rethinking backing out of the deal (i.e. are now considering buying again) since they for some reason only now realize they are going to lose their earnest money.  

We were told we would hear back from them today, but it's late afternoon and still haven't heard from them, and they also haven't signed the termination paperwork yet.  

So we continue forward with open houses/house showings for the weekend.   Although at this point if the original buyers decide they want to buy our house they have to make a new formal offer as their previous one has expired.  We were previously going to give them 1.5% back, but IF (and big if) we were to reconsider them as buyers we would want a full price offer, no cash back or anything.  Although hopefully we are able to avoid them as buyers by getting a new offer from someone new.  

I'll update again if anything changes.  



EDIT 3:

It's now 2 days past closing date.  I was told several times yesterday that the buyer would be signing the paperwork to rescind/terminate their offer that would release the earnest money.  However as I expected the seller has not done that yet.  Makes sense since they have no motivation to do so.

I'll be contacting escrow today directly asking for the money and we'll see what happens.  I have very little confidence in the buyer to do anything at this point.  I'm also looking into real estate lawyers today.

Despite all that, my agent relisted the house yesterday and we have 3 open houses between today and sunday.

Thanks everyone for all the great advice and comments. I was not expecting this to get so much attention.

EDIT 2:  
Ok, buyers are officially backing out of the deal and are sending the termination paperwork.  The buyers agent even offered to take 0% and give it all to the buyer, but they still refused. Sounds like it wasn't a money issue, but a fear issue related to something, guessing current economy stuff, but I don't know for sure.

We will be getting the earnest money back and we relist the house today.

EDIT 1:  
It's now 1 day after closing date. Last I heard is the buyer agent wanted to let the buyer 'cool off' before contacting them again today. It's early morning, so no update yet today.

Buyers blindsided their own agent. It was the escrow officer that was the first to know. They were at the doc signing and just refused to sign.  My agent and buyer agent are each offering 0.5% back to the buyer to help get the deal done.

This was purely the buyer having cold feet, no other reason to back out. They have financing, etc.

This extra frustrating because the house is perfectly ready to sell.  House is cleaned, inside almost entirely repainted, the yard is maintained.  More-so, within the last 5 years we had new roof, new insulation, new furnace, and new heatpump/AC.  I even gave the buyer a list of maintenance records for everything.  And all appliances are staying with the house.  We tried to make it a great house for new buyers to just move into.

And this is the 2nd time we've had trouble with buyers. We listed last year and buyers lost financing 2 weeks before close (due to cosigning on another loan where that 3rd party defaulted), so we ended up delisting and trying again this spring.

According to our contract we are entitled to $10k in earnest money.  If today the buyer doesn't indicate they will go forward with the purchase then I will start the process for getting the earnest money and relisting the house, re-staging, etc.

Original post:

Out of nowhere suddenly the buyers are refusing to complete escrow. Today is the closing date. I've signed seller side of all escrow/etc documents.   These are strong financial buyers, no contingency, 20% down, etc.  We are even giving 1.5% back to help with closing costs/rate buy downs.

If it matters I'm in WA state.

Now, the shear volume of houses I see listed that gray walls is like that song on the radio that you liked well enough when you first heard it, not your favorite, but okay, until you heard it for the hundredth time and started changing the station when it came on. Now, it's like having that song on the radio a million times. Green always used to be my least favorite color for rooms, but now, I'd gladly take the worst shade of green over gray. The only way I'd buy a house that was gray is if I had the money and resources to get it painted any other color right away. So, realistically, when we buy a house, we'll be focusing on ones that are not gray, because the market it too saturated with a color that makes a home look like a bleak prison.

EDIT: The reaction to this post has been quite fascinating. While the vote ratio shows that the majority agrees with me, the minority 38% has been the loudest and most outrageous, with some pro-gray people acting like I kicked their puppy, just because I likely won't buy a house with grey walls. Everyone has their own criteria when buying a house, whether you think it's trivial or not, and you can't bully people into buying a house from you. Without knowing ANYTHING about me, I've been told I can't afford a house because I don't want to have to repaint. It's been quite the weird display of elitist snobbery. Actually, we've had three houses, so far since my husband and I were married 29 years ago, and we're looking for the 4th to move downsize the house and get a bigger yard. We have the right to not buy a house we must put a lot of extra effort into making it what we want. There's a difference between not being able to afford repainting vs not wanting to spend the extra money outside of the mortgage process, which has a lower interest rate than credit cards, and not wanting to unnecessarily deplete savings. And considering the cost of time doing a good job painting, when we could better use that time with other priorities, it's a needless expense, especially since we are disabled, and it's not that easy anymore. We have repainted every house we have had, and it was a pain in the butt even before we were disabled. It is our right to buy a house based on our individual criteria, and if you don't like that, too bad. It's our money, not yours. On this post, pro-gray commenters have called me a Boomer and a Zoomer, though I don't belong to either of those generations. I've been told since we are disabled, we shouldn't own a house, which was an interesting display of bigotry. And one commenter here stalked my page, to bring up something that had nothing to do with the topic, and used what they found on my page to make a vulgar, sexually explicit reply to me, which was deleted, likely by one of the Mods. The vitriol directed towards me has been astounding. 

Unless someone is okay with a sloppy paint job, gray still takes multiple coats of paint, so that repeated talking point claim that it's magically easy to paint over is erroneous. Furthermore, I never said that I was against neutral shades, but some pro-gray people just assumed, like they assumed other inaccurate things about me. There are plenty of warm, inviting tones of neutral shades that are better, in my opinion, than cold, bleak, unwelcoming gray. Many publications over decades have talked about the negative emotional impact of gray rooms, stifling creativity and even triggering feelings of sadness, thus the more reasonable thing to do, especially if someone has kids, is to steer clear gray walls that gives the impression of living in a prison. Despite the ardent defense of gray, and attempts to demean people for not liking the color that makes houses look like a cheap flip job. Realty polls have shown that people are most sick of the color gray, and even just looking at the insights to this post bears that out, because despite the pro-gray people being the loudest voices, 62% of members have upvoted this post. Hence, there is a glut of gray houses just sitting on realty sites for long periods with no buyers. If you want to ignore basic market research to keep a death grip on a trend that is long over, that's up to you, but don't whine and bully when people don't want to buy your house. Nobody owes it to you to buy your house.",125,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1l1hct4/enough_with_the_gray_walls/,1748869082.0,Willing-Aardvark4129,1l1hct4,not_advice_seeking
RealEstate,what to do with extra money,My agent keeps pressuring me to keep pursuing home purchase and that the inspection report is fine,"So I am a first time homebuyer and recently submitted an offer on a house I like. I did my due diligence and had a home inspection completed this past weekend and let’s just say IMO what came back in the report was concerning. 

First, there is an issue with two openings between the slab and siding where animals could just access. There is also a leaking pipe, a retainer wall that separates my house and the neighbors house that was listed as a major issue as it’s leaning. No one can confirm who owns the retainer wall but if it collapsed it will be on my property. 

I ordered the top tier of inspections to cover my bases and spoke directly with the inspector. Now, my agent is trying to convince me this inspection is not that bad and she’s been doing this for 5 years blah, blah, blah. It’s starting to really piss me off because she’s just pressuring me to keep pursuing the sale. I already told her I’m not comfortable with spending this kind of money with these major repairs. Also, the listing says it had a new water heater and HVAC which I found out wasn’t true. 

Now I’m pissed at my agent and I just want my earnest money back. I’m a type of person that follows their instincts and I can’t in good faith buy this house. 

Has anyone else experienced this and if so, what is your advice? I’ve already let my lender know and they ordered an appraisal last week which now I’m being charged for, which I chalk that up to the process. 

Edit: I don’t know who legally is responsible for the retainer wall as the lot next door is empty. The potential property I was buying sits lower and the wall is leaning. Also, I came in at almost full asking price. I want people to understand something, I may be a first time homebuyer but my parents are not. I’ve leaned on them for advice and both agree the fact there were lies in the listing along with this retainer wall expense, it’s not worth it. I did my due diligence by having an inspection done and I paid for extras. 

Update: I trusted my instincts and walked away. Singed the termination letter yesterday. I want to thank everyone for all
the advice and responses. It was very helpful. If anyone knows a really good trustworthy agent in the Atlanta area, please feel free to direct message me with their contact details. I fired the other bozo.  Hopefully I find my home soon!

RealEstate,what to do with extra money,Did we get scammed or not?,"In December, we listed our house in Southern California and 10 days later, we got a cash offer for $10k over asking for a 12 day escrow. The buyer did not have an agent so it was dual representation (saving us money and extra commission for our agent). 

We accepted the offer on Monday and rushed to move. The same day the movers came just to pack up our stuff and move boxes to the garage (Wednesday), the buyer also came by to oversee the inspection. We interacted with the buyer and had a pleasant interaction. This was the same day that he was supposed to make his earnest deposit. A few days later (Friday), our agent hadn’t heard from him and still no deposit. The inspection came back with no findings (the home is only 5 years old). We sent him a notice to perform. Our agent gets an email from the buyers attorney on Saturday saying he had been in a car accident and was in the hospital but would send the deposit that Monday. 

Come Wednesday, still no deposit and still no word so we didn’t have the movers take our stuff to storage. We canceled the deal that Thursday (original day of close) and never heard another peep from the buyers. We figured it had been an awful accident. 

Then, fast forward a few weeks and another home in our neighborhood that was pending went back on the market. Our agent reached out to their agent and asked for the buyers name — SAME GUY! This time, he did not do an inspection and had asked that seller for a 3 day escrow (right before Christmas). That seller had actually fully moved out and put a deposit on another new build home and then had to move back in and lose their deposit. 

Fast forward to April of this year, we have now heard of this buyer doing this “quick escrow, all cash, then ghost” deal with 6 different homes in our area in the past 2 years — with lots of activity recently. Our neighbor filed a police report and nothing happened. We contacted a lawyer and they said we had no case (there are technically damages but he didn’t really scam us, so to speak). In fact, the buyer did pay for a $500 inspection and then had other parties following up and saying he was still in… we’ve now found a mugshot and charges of fraud for the buyer 6 years ago in a town 1 hour from us. There were comments on a police departments facebook page where he was wanted for fraud and many comments saying he had stolen money from them through different business entities. So he has a history of shady dealings and a scheming partner he does this with. Were now wondering if his proof of funds (bank account showing $4M in funds) was fake. 

So my question for the group is: what is this guys angle? Was he trying to squat in our home? Is he doing something weird with the paperwork? We don’t get it! ",196,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1k8n4vm/did_we_get_scammed_or_not/,1745701338.0,millennialmal,1k8n4vm,advice_seeking
RealEstate,what to do with extra money,"Everyone says rent out, but my math says it's barely worth it if at all. Am I missing something???","House details: 450,000. 220000 left on loan. Interest rate 2.99%. PI 1050. Rental estimates are 2500/month right now. 
So if I rent I'd pay a down payment on a new house out of pocket around 125,000. If I sell, I'd use all the money from selling into the down payment. So essentially I am saving 125,000 and around 500/month in interest if I decide to sell.

So the math I did was varying situations of 3,10,30 years. 
If I rent, the money is obviously in the house and any rental profits (if any in the short term even)
If I sell realistically I'd be putting a lot more into my 401k. At the very least what I save in interest I would put in, but I also put a scenario if I increase payments up to 1500 more based on the 125,000 dollars I save. 

My conclusion was in the very short term (~3years to avoid capital gains tax) IF housing prices around my area appreciate 3-4% yearly, it could be worth it. I know the market/my 401k account isn't guaranteed returns, but so is the housing market right? But with that said over 10-30 years renting the house seems not worth it and carries a lot of risk. What I like about just contributing to my 401k is that the money is flexible in that I am contributing monthly instead of 1 lump sum, or holding the value in the home. The main 1 to 1 scenario is contributing 1500 more per month for 10 years and then 500 for the next 20. (1000 per month from the 125k saved, 500 for the interest saved per month). (Assuming big assumption of 8.7% annual returns avg)

I won't go over my 401k limit because actually my wife will be the one doing the extra contributions and she currently contributed a little amount. Also In my math I didn't even include the benefit of lowering our tax liabilities. 

Edit: thanks for all the replies every pro or against comment was insightful! I'm pretty sure I've read every comment before this edit. No decision is final yet as I'll do my final analysis sometime (I'm not in a rush) BUT I likely will be selling. Thanks again!

RealEstate,what to do with extra money,Listing agent and unrepresented buyers - how it’s going ,"We are 5 months or so from the NAR lawsuit and I wanted to share my experiences. I’m primarily a listing agent, sellers are roughly 80% of my business. I work with investors and have a different pricing for them. For my normal sellers that need handholding, here’s what’s up. I do not offer dual agency, but my broker does (rare, happened once) My average market price is 200k. I charge 3% to list a home and is increased to 4% if the buyer is unrepresented. Why? Because there is no such thing as a free lunch and I’m representing one side while facilitating the entire transaction. So far I’ve had four sales with the buyer wanting no representation, because they are “saving money.”  Here’s how that looks. The buyer probably saw the house through a private showing, or an open house. We exchange info and the buyer shows interest. Since I’m not providing guidance or representation to the buyer, I say if they want to put an offer in, they can have an attorney draft one (we are NOT an attorney state) or they can send me what terms they want to offer and I will present to the seller. They send over a pre-approval and name a price. This is where I get to work. I communicate all of the details to the seller, since I’m just representing them, we craft a counter offer on a sales contract that gets the seller everything they want. Any decent buyer agent would find half-dozen things to counter as our contracts have over 30 areas to negotiate. But the buyer usually accepts it. Other than my initial email outline with all of the important dates, I’m not allowed to give the buyer guidance. Inevitably this is where things get hairy, because they don’t know the process, especially if they think agents just open doors.  

Let me just outline a few of the issues I’ve had with the four unrepresented buyers. 

 1. They did not send the earnest money.  

2. They only had a home inspection done, they did not have the septic, sewer lateral, termite, gas, radon. Didn’t ask for repairs in writing by the deadline.  

3. The lender told them they could change the loan type and save money, except they couldn’t because it had to be conventional financing not FHA. those buyers lost a decent amount of earnest because they did not abide within the financing deadline.  

4. One of them did not have have email. Which meant they needed to drive to my office to pick up documents and my office was an hour away.      

 5. Seller provided occupancy inspection as outlined in contract, buyer didn’t notice it was not a passing occupancy.  

6. Didn’t show up for the walkthrough.   

7. Never got the utilities on in their name, utilities were returned off the next day.  

8. Call / email me at least a dozen times wanting advise / counsel (how can I get out of contract, how do I read the title commitment, what does — mean) and I can’t provide it.  

9. Find out they had a house to close on before they could buy!   

10. Don’t fill out the title paperwork, delay closing.   

11. Ditto with required lender documents.  

12. Choose terrible lenders who I know will not close on time. We have extra $ in the contract as nonrefundable when this happens.  
 
13. Say something along the lines of how much money they are saving, how agents are overpaid. Every. Single. Time.  

14. I am now obliged to physically meet the appraiser, inspector, insurance company, contractor, occupancy inspector, buyer walkthrough because I’m facilitating the transaction. 

15. The absolute worst is they don’t take deadlines seriously, or act like it’s MY fault for missing it. 

So all of this stress, for an extra 2k, that’s more like 1k after broker fees and expenses, is not worth it. I’d much rather a competent agent be on the other side and make it a fair fight. I feel like the seller can definitely get more money when the buyer is unrepresented, but they also have more to lose out on if the buyer totally flakes. The other part of this is the price point I work in is a LOT of first-time buyers. So it’s not their fault they don’t have the knowledge or what knowledge they have is bad. I try to approach each one as an individual but man, I’m noticing some repeating patterns, and I don’t like it. My rate will be increasing before the crazy spring market hits.

RealEstate,what to do with extra money,Seller's Agent refusing to return termination and release document unless I give seller 1/2 of escrow.,"I was under contract on a house. We did the inspection and agreed to 7 extra days of due dil because everything was happening around Thanksgiving. During the inspection, we found some serious electrical issues, think exposed live wires over water sources level serious, wiring leading from the house to the electric box outside completely exposed level serious). We went to the seller and asked for all the electrical problems and some other safety issues to be addressed. The seller's agent came back with: radon mitigation system, spray to keep the termites from coming back, and $200 for leaky faucets.

At this point, we realized that they were not negotiating in good faith and we were not going to come to an agreement and we were still well within the 7 additional days of due dil. My agent sent over the termination and release form. The seller's agent came back and said, we will only sign this if I agree to give the seller 1/2 of the escrow. My agent has reached out, her broker has reached out, and my agent's broker has explained to the seller's agent's broker that this is extortion...all to no avail. I am currently under contract on another house but my mortgage underwriting is in limbo because we don't have the termination and release form

During this time the house has not only gone back on the market but is pending sale again. Today my agent and her broker have emailed, called, and texted both the seller's agent and her broker explaining that I've been more than patient, but we need that document and proof that the FULL escrow is being transferred back to me by end of day or I will be seeking legal representation tomorrow morning. Man...if this seller's agent makes me lawyer up it's going to be more than just my escrow monitarily and I will have my lawyer contacting both the state and national Realtor Associations as well as the large national real estate firm they all hang their licenses under.

I guess this is more of a rant than a question, but has ANYONE seen anything like this? I mean we have 100% documentation for our contract, and they legally have no foot to stand on, why would this agent or this broker risk their license and reputations on what is honestly probably a very small sum of money to them?

(I work in a non-profit so all sums of money are large to me).

UPDATE!  
First, thanks to everyone for their comments. I haven't gotten to read them all because, for the last two days, I was moving out of my current house and getting stuff into storage for the next month.

The Seller's Agent finally gave the document to the seller to sign. We got it back yesterday evening, and it's onward to the earnest money holder. This wasn't the seller's doing; the agent wouldn't even give the seller the document to sign. Our assumption (because the Seller's Agent is obviously not forthcoming) is that she has been blowing smoke up the seller's (who I should mention has the property via an estate) ass about 1) the actual condition of the property 2) how fast and for how much the property would sell in an as-is condition, and was trying to save face and act like what were were asking for was crazy.

Anyway, I can go into the weekend with my house sold (12:30 today) and my contract on the new house no longer in limbo.

  
UPDATE 2:   
Comments to the following:  
1) the people who are like ""over $500!?"", I get what you were saying, and had it come to not being able to move forward with the new place and just rolling over I would have rolled over. 

2) the people talking about the cost of the lawyers...I worked in Commercial Real Estate for a LONG time as the head of creative marketing, hell I had my RE license for a hot minute...I was not going to be paying for a lawyer. My old Managing Director (who was my work dad) had one lined up for me for no cost.  He wanted the first go at the Seller's agent and her Broker though...they are lucky they capitulated, arguing and yelling at the opposing side of a deal is legit his favorite thing.

3) Everyone who said my agent sucks, yes she does, so much. And honestly, this is the tip of the iceberg. It's too late in the game to switch so riding this shit out.

RealEstate,what to do with extra money,"""Points are a scam."" No, they're not.","I've seen this idea a few times on a couple of threads today, so I figured I'd make a post about it, to start a discussion on this, and hopefully learn some things myself. 

There seems to be this idea that buying points is a bad thing. People have posted their closing costs, and that line about points seems to get some folks fired up. A few choice phrases I've seen:

* Points are a scam.
* Points are for those who don't know how to properly shop for a mortgage
* If a bank/broker are offering points it's because it's always in their favor
* Don't pay points. Just don't do it. Use a local lender instead.

This is not right at all (that last line really confused me, what do the points have to do with the institution?). While buying points does incur an upfront cost, in many situations this can be helpful. First, lets talk about what points are. When it comes down to it:

**Points are a bribe you give to the bank for a lower interest rate on a fixed-rate mortgage.**

That's it. Lets look at a scenario:

I'm a buyer, I want to buy my forever home, I have good credit, and no current debt. I have $100,000 of my savings earmarked for a down payment, but I'd like to keep some of it for furniture, upgrades, etc. I found a house I love, they accepted my offer of $400k. Now, I go down to my local community bank -- they offer great interest rates, no fees, and they're friendly and knowledgeable, far more than the big online boys. 

I tell the loan officer I have 20% down - 80k, and I'm looking to borrow 320k at a fixed rate, over 30 years. He tells me my credit is great, and he can get me a 5% rate, and shows me a amortizing schedule, summarized as follows:


Desc | Amt 
---|---
Loan Amount | $320,000
Interest Rate | 5%
Term | 30 Years (360 Payments)
APR | 5%
Monthly Payment (P&I) | $1,717.83

 It then goes on to show me how much I'll pay on every payment, what portion goes to interest, versus principal all the way through the 360th payment. A bit of math shows:

After year| You will have paid in interest: | In principal:
---|---|---
1	|$15,892.78|$4,721.17
2	|$31,544.02|$9,683.88
3	|$46,941.35|$14,900.50
5	|$76,921.69|$26,148.06
8	|$119,640.86|$45,270.74
15	|$206,437.76|$102,771.49
20	|$254,238.26|$158,040.74
30	|$298,418.51|$320,000.00

So, over the life of this loan, I will have paid nearly $300k in interest, and $320k in principal. I tell the loan officer, that it seems crazy that I'm paying 300k to borrow this. I'm sure I could refinance this later if rates go down, and I suppose that even if this is my forever home, life may have different ideas, and I may sell it before that 30 years, but... lets just assume I plan on keeping it for the foreseeable future and that rates aren't likely to go down in the next 5-10 years.

The loan officer says I can buy points in order to lower that rate. He said, for $3,200, he'd lower the rate by 25 basis points making my interest rate 4.75%. I ask him to show me the numbers again, side by side:

Desc | Loan 1 | Loan 2
---|---|---
Loan Amount | $320,000 | $320,000
Interest Rate | 5% | 4.75%
Points Cost | 0 | $3200
Term | 30 Years | 30 years
APR | 5% | 4.8%
Monthly Payment (P&I) | $1,717.83 | $1,669.27	


Ok, I'm saving $48.56 month-to-month, but was it worth paying $3200 for? It depends. It will take 66 payments (five and a half years), saving $48.56 per payment in order to make up for that. If I keep the house for this long, I'll break even on that points investment.

But what about the whole loan? I will be saving nearly $50 per payment, but what does that equal:

After year| You will have paid in interest Loan 1: | Paid in interest AND points in Loan 2:
---|---|---
1	|$15,892.78|$18,293.42
2	|$31,544.02|$33,147.12
3	|$46,941.35|$47,749.46
5	|$76,921.69|$76,150.65
8	|$119,640.86|$116,542.30
15	|$206,437.76|$198,274.55
20	|$254,238.26|$243,034.25
30	|$298,418.51|$284,137.73

So looking at this, in loan 2 even before I've made my first payment, I'm already out $3200 compared to loan 1. However, the interest savings show that somewhere in year 5, I start saving money compared to loan 1.

By the end of the 30 years, I'll have paid over $14k more in loan 1 versus buying points in loan 2.

The loan officer tells me this is just an example, and I can buy the amount of points I feel comfortable with - he says for every 1% of the loan amount I give him, he will knock .25% off the interest rate. (This will vary from bank-to-bank). 

This is where you compare the APR - this takes into account the cost of the points/fees plus the total amount of interest paid and comes up with an actual rate. In the example above, buying another point for $3200 brings the interest rate from 4.75% to 4.5% and the APR from 4.8% down to 4.67%.

Choosing to buy points and how many points can depend on your situation - do you have enough cash to buy those points, if so are you taking away from your down payment? If you're under but close to a 20% down payment it may be worth skipping the points and hitting that 20% to avoid PMI. 

If you don't know how long you plan to own the place, or if you plan on refinancing soon (rates going down?), or if you'd rather keep your extra money in the market or elsewhere may all impact your decision to buy points and how much to buy. Remember, homeowners stay in a home for eight years on average, and many may refinance before then as well.

To those saying ""it's a scam, it's only benefiting the lender"" - it is true that it is usually in the interest of a lender to sell you points, BUT it's value is as hedge against inflation and the cost of reselling loans - not as a way of sticking it to the borrower, getting more money out of the borrower. All things being equal, over the 30 year loan, a borrower buying points will pay less to the bank than a borrower who didn't buy points.

Please feel free to correct me where I'm wrong, or even tell me if I'm flat out bonkers.

p.s. somewhat unrelated, but another myth to be busted: banks don't ""Frontload interest in a mortgage"" as a way of sticking it to borrowers either - it's just the way amortization works. You have a big balance at the beginning of the loan, you pay interest as a percentage of the balance. As the balance decreases, so does the interest amount.

**tldr:** In conclusion, points are a tool, not a scam. Points lower your interest rate and monthly payments and you (hopefully) own the property long enough for the savings to cover cost of those points. Balancing how many points versus how long you plan on owning the property is key.

RealEstate,what to do with extra money,25M Am I stupid for buying a 225k house right now?,"I am 25M and make about $66,000 per year gross. I have been renting from my landlord who is also my best friend's father for 3 years. He had only been charging us (my friend and I) the cost of his mortgage and nothing more which came out to about $1,300/mo total. It has come time that he wants to sell, so him and I worked out a deal where he offered me the house at a $225,000 sale price. He needs to net this amount to pay off his mortgage and get his original down payment back. He won't be making money on the sale so, I will cover the closing costs, back taxes (if applicable), and realtor fee. I am only wanting to pay about $4,000 out of pocket, so the rest of the fees are rolled into my mortgage which comes out to about a $234,000 mortgage with $0 down (USDA Loan) at 6.625%.

This will equate to $1,808 per month with mortgage, property taxes, and home insurance.

Utilities generally cost me $133 for electric in the summer, $173 in the winter, and $92 for internet.

My monthly net income is $3,850/ mo. I have no other debts and have been regularly saving $1,500/ mo after my current expenses which are $750 for my split of rent and utilities, $85 car insurance, $50 phone, $42 various subscriptions, and we'll say another $30/mo for donations to causes. Food and gas vary but I have been getting better at meal prepping and only shopping at Aldi for lower costs. 

He already had a realtor show up to give her professional opinion on what the property could be listed for and she said she would feel confident at $260k list price. Everyone I have spoken to seems to think the property is worth $250k - $265k. The Zillow estimate also says $263k.

If that is true, then I should be walking into the home with almost $30k in equity right off the bat. The appraisal will be happening soon.

I will also have my girlfriend contributing at least $500 per month to utilities and mortgage until she gets a full time job since she just graduated college. At which point we can get closer to an even split but I want to base the split on an even percentage of our respective incomes rather than just an even split of the total cost.

It will be a bit more tight on the money but everything is so expensive nowadays. I don't want to pay the rent prices anywhere around because they are about the same as what I would be paying in the mortgage anyways, also rent is just money into the void that I will never see a return on. All of the other houses I have seen for sale are either the same price or much higher for less house than what I am getting with this deal. I'm talking like $250k fixer-uppers on less than an acre of land.

This is my first time buying a house and I am excited but also terrified because it's just so damn expensive with not only the rates but the general cost of any property now.

Let me know what you think! Is this a good use of my money and effort or am I crazy to spend that much on housing when I only make as much as I do? I will still be able to save a few hundred per month with my girlfriend's help but almost nothing without her.

  
Property Specs:

* $225k sale price

* New roof, siding, guttering, and repainted 1 year ago
* Brick ranch style home
* 1 acre lot
* No HOA, out of city limits
* Off state highway, 40 minutes from Indianapolis
* Enclosed shed ( not sure of the square footage but it could easily fit 3 cars with some extra space)
* Smaller open face garden shed with metal roof

* Not a flood zone
* All dead trees already cut down and all of the wood leftover stacked and remaining at the back of the yard


Edit:
The landlord wanted the process to be quick and easy, so he said I had to use a realtor for the transaction. He didn't want to learn how and what to fill out legally for the transfer of ownership and all. The relator I am using is only charging $3500. The landlord does not have a realtor representing him.

RealEstate,bonus invest,"Is buying a single-wide home on a 10,000 sq ft lot a stupid decision?","I’m 24, making $95K/year, and I have a fiancé who stays home with our 11-month-old son. We’re currently renting, but we’re considering buying a 2021 single-wide manufactured home on a 10,000 sq ft lot. The home is listed for $149K, and single-wides are common and accepted in the area we’re looking at. The big bonus is that it has easy access to DFW, which makes it convenient for work and commuting.

Here’s the deal:

Option 1: Single-wide manufactured home on a 10,000 sq ft lot for $149K

	•	Pros:
	•	Monthly payment will be around $1,300–1,400 (similar to our current rent).
	•	We’d own the land, which seems like a big advantage.
	•	The home is newer, so there shouldn’t be many repairs or issues.
	•	We’re saving money by buying instead of continuing to rent, and the money is going toward something that’ll eventually build equity.
	•	Easy access to DFW—great for commuting and work flexibility.
	•	Cons:
	•	It’s a single-wide, so it’s not the traditional “stick-built” house that most people expect when they think of homeownership.
	•	The lot size is 10,000 sq ft, which is just under a quarter acre. I’m wondering if that’s big enough for a family, especially if we want to make improvements or have more space down the line.

Option 2: Stretching for a bigger home ($200K+ range)

	•	Pros:
	•	A more traditional, spacious home (probably a double-wide or stick-built).
	•	Higher resale potential, especially if it’s a more “standard” home.
	•	More room for the family to grow, possibly in a more desirable neighborhood.
	•	Some homes in this range might be farther from DFW, giving you more space for the money.
	•	Cons:
	•	Monthly payments would be higher—probably in the $1,600–2,200 range.
	•	Higher taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs.
	•	Less room in the budget for emergencies, savings, or future investments.
	•	More financial pressure and a longer-term commitment.
	•	Homes in this range might be farther from DFW, which could make the commute tougher.

Option 3: Continuing to rent for the same price

	•	Pros:
	•	No long-term commitment.
	•	Flexibility to move if the situation changes.
	•	No risk of dealing with home repairs or maintenance costs.
	•	Cons:
	•	No equity being built.
	•	Rent can go up at any time, and there’s no control over the living space.
	•	Longer-term, it feels like a waste of money because you’re just paying someone else’s mortgage.

So, is buying a single-wide on a 10,000 sq ft lot a good move?

I know it’s not the most glamorous option, but it seems like a smart financial decision, and it’s a big step up from renting. Plus, it gives us easy access to DFW, which is important for work. I’m just not sure if it’s a mistake to go for something that feels “less than” what people expect in terms of traditional homes. Would love some honest opinions from anyone who’s made a similar choice or gone through a similar decision process!

The mobile home is about a block away from Cedar Creek Lake in TX. Area is growing rapidly as well. Buy the single wide, continue to rent, or buy a more expensive home? Or rent is currently 1450.  We also live about 5 minutes from the single wide home right now. It is a 2021 and has not been lived in as far as I know.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1k33ktc/is_buying_a_singlewide_home_on_a_10000_sq_ft_lot/,1745089131.0,scholarlypimp,1k33ktc,advice_seeking
RealEstate,bonus invest,I invested £50k in my brother's property. What now?,"I helped my brother purchase his first house in the UK in 2022. The house was purchased for £115k (cheap, I know!)

I've invested £50k in total - a £15k deposit and £35k in renovation costs. We estimate the house is worth around £180k today (but this is yet to be confirmed by an estate agent).

I know we should have sorted all this a long time ago, but now that the renovation project is complete, it's time to get something in writing and decide how we settle things up. We don't currently have anything in writing, so all this money has been changing hands in trust. The general agreement was 50/50.

My brother now has a (beautiful) child, and an on/off relationship with the child's mother (I do not trust her at all, so mostly want to protect my investment from her). My brother and I have a great relationship, and I completely trust him. But obviously I know that I need to officially protect my investment.

I've spoken to a solicitor who advised that we just need to create a deed of trust (or similar document), sign it (with video) and email it to each other, replying with acknowledgement. And also that my brother should update his will to reflect my interest in the property. Given he's not married, the solicitor advised that no other officialised documents/processes are required.

So what should I do?

1. Remain a 50/50 investor in the property. But I'm not sure how I'd see any benefit from this until the property is sold.
2. Get my money out (my brother could remortgage in 2027 and pay me back in full)
3. Take some money out, and own a lesser share (for reduced risk)
4. Something else?

In any of the above, how would you recommend we structure the deal?

Some additional considerations;  
The 5-year mortgage (£100k) is in my brother's name. I am not on any documents.

I've invested £50k (as a gift) since 2022. Is it fair to expect 4-5% (standard rate) interest on this investment? This equals £10k over 5 years, so we could cancel out his labour costs and simplify the whole agreement to 50/50.

My brother invested his evenings/weekends renovating what he could - we agreed this labour over 2 years to be c. £10k in value. Is this fair? Should we only honour this bonus if the house has a sufficient gain in value?

Thanks in advance for your advice :)",8,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1hwxixe/i_invested_50k_in_my_brothers_property_what_now/,1736376894.0,lupethejedi,1hwxixe,advice_seeking
RealEstate,bonus invest,"FHA loan - short term rental (while we are traveling), but still our primary residence. Looking for FHA Rules citation (not FHAloan.com). ","We are in the process of purchasing a house with an FHA loan. We travel a lot. We had planned on Airbnb'ing it while we're gone (approx 4 months out of the year total...). We will have no problem at all meeting the criteria of it being our primary residence. I can easily find that definition/criteria in the HUD documentation.

What I cannot find is exactly where it says we cannot have short-term rentals...or where we can rent out a single room (as the internet is anectodally telling us). The HUD guide is 1800+ pages. I've also asked a friend who is a HUD housing counselor...and she's unsure.

Does anyone have this citation in actual HUD documentation? I do not care at all what [FHAloan.com](http://FHAloan.com) says as it is not government-affiliated. I read government contracts and documentations as part of my profession...so I'd really like to read the actual rules. The mortgage does not specifically say we cannot - just that we have to follow FHA loan rules. 

I have a hard time believing that claiming something like 20% of our mortgage as rental income would flag it as an investment property...but I could see it potentially causing an issue. Which is why I want to read the actual guidelines published by HUD.

RealEstate,bonus invest,Thoughts on how to upgrade from condo to single family home?,"Howdy! Really hoping that I may be able to tap into the wisdom and expertise of more seasoned homeowners on this forum :) 

A bit of background. I am a 40-year-old single man. Back in May 2021, I went under contract to purchase my first home (a new build 2 bed/2bath condo in a suburb of Denver). I closed in the Fall of 2021. I locked in at an interest rate of just over 3% and paid about $325K for the property.  

My lifelong dream has been to own a single-family home. I don't necessarily want a large home as it's just me, but I'd love to buy a smaller home with a yard where I can have a garden. I'd even be open to a townhouse with a small fenced in yard. Townhomes with yards and starter single family homes in my area start at about $450 to $500K and go up from there. 

When I purchased my condo, I had a salary of just over $60K, but I've worked hard over the past few years and recently secured a promotion. I am now making $108K ($123K with bonus potential). Looking at online mortgage calculators, it looks like this salary puts me in the range to possibly upgrade to a townhome or single-family home. 

I've only been in my condo for 3 years, and my understanding is that ideally it's best to stay in your home for at least 5 years. I'm not sure how accurate they are, but some of the mortgage rate forecasts that I've been reading are forecasting that mortgage rates may drop below 5% and could even get closer to 4% in 2027/2028 (I take those forecasts with a grain of salt as there are so many variables, and no one has a crystal ball). Regardless, I likely wouldn't plan to buy another place for at least a couple more years. 

I'm looking for advice as to how I can prepare myself to be in a position to upgrade in 2 to 3 years. I've worked very hard to improve my financial situation over the past couple years. Last month, I achieved a financial goal of having a six-month emergency fund in place, which I feel really good about. Now, I'd like to open a second high yield savings account to start pumping money into so that I can come to my next home purchase with as high of a down payment as possible. I'm thinking it would be wiser to save my down payment as opposed to investing? Also, thinking long term, I wonder if it would make sense to eventually rent out my condo since I have such a low interest rate on it, and take out a second mortgage for my next home purchase, or would it be better to sell the condo and roll the equity into my next down payment? 

Lastly, I feel like I'm getting a late start in life on all of this. I feel behind for my age, and I'm desperately trying to catch up. By the time I purchase my next home, I will be nearing my mid-40s. I'm new to all of this, and I worry that I've missed the boat in a lot of ways as I didn't buy real estate when I was younger, and before home prices exploded. I think I'm just needing some encouragement and some good advice as to where I should go from here. Any tips from anyone else who has been in a similar situation? Should I just keep saving as much as I can, then be ready when the right opportunity comes along? Anything else I should be doing to get myself in the best situation possible? Thank you for any input you are willing to share!

RealEstate,bonus invest,Seeking advice: Investment property or SFH? (LOS ANGELES),"Hi Reddit friends!

My wife and I are looking to get into Los Angeles real estate finally as we have been saving for a long time for a down payment. Really quick summary:

-I see a lot of multi-family deals for rehabs that we could rehab, flip, or BRRRR potentially

-We live in a condo for $500/month and are comfortable here, and are not rushing to buy a SFH and put all of our income into paying the mortgage and lose our chance to maybe save up more money to eventually invest again.

-If we do a multi-family investment, I'm still unsure about how that would work for refinancing and putting that money to work in another property. I'm not seeing any of my calculators for analyzing deals showing that to be a good return with the rents in the area.

LONG STORY SHORT QUESTION:

In this scenario, **would you buy a multi family property and try your hand at renovating/flipping/BRRRR** and live in the same condo we are in now for $500/month, or **would you get a single family home and maybe try doing a flip on that instead?**

Bonus question: should we even consider FHA loans? I have read that the strict inspections and that coupled with the fact that sellers don't want the long timeframes on the loan closing are not favored versus a conventional loan. We couldn't do all cash as anything we are looking at is in the $1.5-1.8 million range for properties.

RealEstate,getting started investing,Are we stupid to give up our $725 mortgage @ 2.875%?,"Hi guys,

We are prepping to move and we were actually already under contract to buy another house, but the deal fell through. When the deal fell through we decided it would be best to get our house on the market first, rather than having 3 mortgages (original house, HELOC, new house). 

Anyways, I inherited my 1/2 duplex about 5 years ago with a $100k mortgage and refinanced when rates were super low. It’s a 2 bed/2bath, 1,200 SF, 2 car garage, very compact neighborhood with an HOA. 

There are a number of reasons why I don’t want to be here anymore: 1) we need more space (I wfh, husband runs a business & family is always crashing at our place, and we may start a family soon), 2) I am treasurer of the HOA out of necessity and we are having a hard time finding a new president, which means big problems and no one will step up, 3) we want more privacy, 4) I live where there are hurricanes and want a concrete house rather than wood. 

We have $210K equity. That started as just $50k years ago. Dual income HH making $130k combined, only other debt is a truck at 1.9% that we will pay off when we move. We have another $30k saved to throw towards the down payment and we’ve been investing for years since this house has been so cheap so we’ve accumulated $150k in investments in the last 4 years. The new house would be $350k-$430k, our current one is worth $305k 

I really hate debt. It’s scary to think about increasing our mortgage above $1,500, but I feel like it’ll only get worse if we continue to wait between prices rising when interest rates drop and potentially not being able to sell my own home if we end up in a receivership due to not having a president on the HOA board.

I'm 17 in a small town in Indiana and I'm looking to get started in real estate/investing, and I'd really like to have my own business one day. I have some money saved up, I'm just curious if I can do anything right now to get started (obviously I'm pretty limited until I turn 18).
I'm unsure where to start due to my limited budget and experience.
Here are some of my questions:

Is wholesaling a realistic approach in a smaller town?

Are there any resources you could recommend to someone my age?

Do you recommend anything I can do right now to start?

What are some strategies I can explore?

I'm excited to put in the work and I would love any advice, tips, or personal experiences you would be willing to share!

RealEstate,how much to save,Top dollar for 40 year old neglected boomer houses is getting ridiculous.,"Locked in a 2.75% APR during the COVID era, built up a few years of equity, and have been aggressively saving for the last four years. I’ve been house hunting in my area, Western NC, which is still very much a seller’s market despite being a lower to mid cost of living region.

Viewed a $600K listing yesterday, 3,000 square feet in a “nice” community, clearly priced at the top of the market. We walk in, and the paint is literally peeling off the walls, black mold is everywhere—air vents, window sills, you name it. The entire place felt damp, and you could smell the moisture immediately.

Then we checked out the basement. Rat droppings everywhere. One of the rooms looked like it was ripped straight out of *Saw I*: dirty, covered in kitty litter and cat feces. All it was missing were the chains and the severed foot.

How are people asking top dollar for homes that should honestly be condemned?

So my realtor reaches out to the seller’s agent, and she tells us they already have three offers on the place. The house has been on the market for four damn days. Three offers? Are you kidding me? Who the hell is actually buying this garbage?

edit: I am not disparaging the age of the house and expecting an older house should be cheap, I am disparaging the OWNERS of the house for not keeping up with their property to the point where a house that is NOT old should be condemned and torn down to the ground.

edit #2: holy fuck the boomers out themselves so quick it's nuts.

edit #3: I am 1 hour out from any major city in North Carolina, it is not Asheville or the surrounding area of Asheville. I WISH IT WAS!

RealEstate,how much to save,"Can’t sleep because of how upset I am, seller put back house on the market before closing","I probably will delete this by morning because I feel it’s very identifying. 

We were supposed to close yesterday. Lender caused a delay (not our fault, took them longer to process things), closing didn’t happen. Seller’s agent said either they have a clear to close by 5pm or they’re listing the property as “active” again. 

Lender sends them clear to close at 4:45pm, or at least that’s what they said. Closing was now moved to Tuesday of next week. At 5:20pm I look on the real estate app and the house is back on the market as active, not pending. Zero communication from seller’s agent. He won’t answer any calls from our agent. 

Since then I’ve been very upset. We were so close to closing. I’m worried we lose our earnest money. There’s a financing condition on the loan, but there’s also a closing date of the 3rd of July, so I’m not sure how toast we are. What do you all think?

Update: so 2 business days after initial closing day, the lender got everything together and said we were ready to close. They also offered to pay per diem to the seller since sellers were so upset and demanded that. The seller and seller’s agent stopped all communication for days. My agent and the loan officer kept calling them and leaving them messages with no answer. At that point I was very upset because it sounded like we were going to lose our earnest money at no fault of our own and over just a few days of delay. We finally get a message back from the seller’s agent saying he’s trying to calm the seller down. A day later we get a message saying the seller is willing to go to closing. We just had to do an amendment. I think the seller realized that an offer like ours was not common in this market in our area. This whole thing was very dramatic and blown up way more than it should’ve been. All this stress and drama were so unnecessary. Over a few days of delays…

Update2: We finally closed. Seller and seller’s agent were complete assholes. They made a huge deal over a few days of delays. Caused me and my husband a lot of anxiety over losing our earnest money for no fault of our own. Lots of sleepless nights and tension headaches for me but I’m a believer of Karma and I believe Karma will get her. Lots of bs tactics and threats. I really wish I had known how crappy they were, I would’ve walked away from the get go. The seller was all up in our business calling our lender and demanding personal info about us such as our salary etc. unfortunately the lender shared way more than I would like, without our consent. She had formulated an opinion that we cannot afford the loan and will be rejected. She thought that the delay was because of that. This wasn’t true because even though lender told her how much we make, she had no idea how much savings or assets we have. She also decided to remove a screwed-in vanity that she had agreed to leave for us, worth about $500. Refused to compensate or return of course.

RealEstate,how much to save,"Highest offer not accepted bc we weren't ""physical therapists""","Housing marketing is cooling everywhere but Long Island, NY seems like. After a week-long bidding war, we countered another buyers $700k offer (which included inspection waiver), with our $725k offer waiving appraisal but included a no-concession inspection for piece of mind. 

Sellers accepted the lower offer bc the other buyers were physical therapists and viewed the deal as safer. We had a 20% down-payment and had our other assets verified, so realistically how much risk were they saving? Honestly feels like some disguised discrimination bullshit -- but what can you do.

Such a frustrating situation.

June Housing Trends: Delistings Jump 47% as Sellers Quit the Market https://share.google/RdUin6l5TdA6ViqTp

I looked in my area and see it quite a bit (Tacoma WA).  I had saved comps to my house, most are now delisted.  Two sold for over listing. 

Rentals are up price-wise too.  As much as I hate the idea, I may also do the rental route.  Whoever rents it will be paying the same monthly payment as if they bought- how sad is that 😂.

Any other sellers doing likewise?  I'm going to spend some time this weekend exploring my options as a rental.   Really appreciating my rental mgmnt company and attorney pals right now for good info.  Although WA is not landlord friendly, you can inspect the property as many times as you want with 48 hours notice.   My friendship with my neighbors is also a benefit because they will rat out any unseemly behavior. That mitigates a lot of concern for me.

**Editing to add that i bought in April 2013 so no golden handcuffs here lol.

RealEstate,how much to save,Agent got defensive when I brought up renegotiating commission when I found out he will be representing myself(seller) and the people who put in an offer (seller).,"Edit title. I am the seller the other people are the buyer. 

So I have a home that just got put on the market 215k. I found a local agent on YouTube and loved him. He offered to sell the home for a total 5.5% commission and I offered an even 6% and he took it. We agreed he would keep 3.5 and the buyers agent would get 2.5. Before the house even gets on the market he shows it to a buyer of his. Wonderful! Great news. They like it and put in an offer of 200k before it hits the market. That’s close to our bottom dollar and he knows this. We planed to have it on the market for a month or 2 before we dropped that low and let the market decide our bottom dollar and honestly we are willing to drop to 180k if the inspections come back too bad and the market shows us that we need to drop. So we tell him to counter at 210k and that we plan to renegotiate his commission. I was thinking about going for 5% to save a little cash on all sides. Before I get to tell him what I was wanting to negotiate to he becomes quite defensive. Am I in the wrong here? Did I just insult my agent? 

Update*******

Okay, first off, thank you all for your advice, even if it was rude. Any advice is appreciated. To clear a few questions up. I am the seller. This is my first ever house being sold. I know things are different now, but in the past all I have ever been taught is seller covers all commissions for seller and buyer. 3% and 3% split. For a total of 6%. Yes it might have been a bad decision to offer him an extra 0.5 but I wanted to show good faith and motivate him to sell and entice a buyers agent to want to show more. It’s currently a buyers market in my area from what I hear and homes are sitting for quite some time. I double checked the agreement and it actually does have a section for in case this happens and he gets all the commission. Yes I should have read it all over , but like I said, I’m a first time seller and not the best at this. Due to this I have decided not to renegotiate the commission. I am disappointed this situation was not brought to my attention verbally during or seller’s agreement signing and negotiations. To me it seams a little greedy, but hard work should be paid for no matter how I feel. 

To those who disapprove of me liking my agent and telling him too much about my bottom dollar. You are probably right, but don’t most sellers try to find agents they like? 

I will be a little better prepared for the next time I sell a home. This whole situation has put a bad taste in my mouth. 

Update on the sale of the home: 

I sat on the offer for a few days to feel things out and of course talk with my agent. A few hours after the fall out phone call of me hurting his feelings I got another call from him. He said I questioned his character, and yes I did, representing both parties definitely makes me question this. I did some more research and technically he will not be representing both, but just acting as median broker? Or something like that. He was under the impression that I would have a true realtor representation and that is what I was paying for. By the paperwork in this situation it appears I was wrong. In the future I will remember this a negotiate this situation ahead of time. 


Now onto the sale. His buyers noticed the house officially hit the market and is getting a lot of attention and it was only on the market for 5 hours. Before I could counter they offered full price of 215k. Which seams strange that all of sudden 15k appears after I start talking about renegotiating a commission. But non the less, I will accept the full price offer and not fight the 6% commission. I’ll keep y’all updated on how the deal goes down.

I am currently saving money towards my down payment and I will probably be in the market for a house around $400k.

RealEstate,how much to save,"Im scared, i dont know if buying a condo was the right decision…now I want to move out and sell or rent it and live with my parents","I’m a first time homebuyer. I bought a condo in November, 2 bed 1 bath. My loan is conventional for 315k at 6.75 percent interest. My salary is 100k but i live in Northern VA, and my take home is way lower. The condo fee gets raised 9 percent each year. I had no idea so the condo fee is 490 right now different from what i originally thought i was getting into. My utilities are 200 a month, which i think is ridiculously high for one person. I’m very conservative with how much energy I use whether it be gas, electricity, heating, water. During the process, i was informed the condo fee covers water as well but i found after closing the condo fee only covers sewage and community maintenance. I was really upset the seller gave me incorrect information despite following up multiple times. Every month im living paycheck to paycheck but I’m only surviving right now because of my savings. I saved up a really good amount in high school and college. Unfortunately, when i signed my offer i fell for “get the higher rate with closing cost help and refinance later” quote from my mortgage broker. Now, i am seeing that the loan amount matters more and it’s not as easy to just refinance. Who knows when the rates will drop… im really worried that I’m stuck in this position and i dont know what taxes will be like for my closing cost help. I thought i couldnt get taxed on it but there is a chance I might which i cant afford to shelve out right now. I am 23 living in a suburb town completely new to me, have no quality of life and friends but really needed a place due to work and buying seemed like a good option as rent is just as high as my mortgage in the area. I looked at comps and highest i could rent my place for is 2100. My monthly payments are 2900. I would have to pay the rest myself. I dont know what to do. It feels like i made a stupid decision and it sounds like i didn’t do my due diligence and research. At the time, i really spent a lot of time and energy into finding a place and did my research. It took me 6 months and multiple offers until i found my current place. I could have backed out during my inspection, but at that point I was exhausted, thought i had it figured out, and was slightly pressured by my realtor, but i know now i was missing a lot of things. It’s really hard for me to share this and accept my situation right now. I’m terrified i am house poor and will never get out of it at the age of 23… what are my options for taxes, and getting out of this situation or easing the pressure? Please be kind.

RealEstate,how much to save,Still having buyers remorse 9 months later,"I bought my first home almost 9 months ago and have extreme regret on almost a daily basis. I had anxiety going into the purchase and wanted to back out because it was a lot farther from where I was looking, but thought I was self sabotaging and it had been a long process for me so I thought I was just getting in my own head. So I went for it unfortunately. 

My commute to work and things I enjoy (restaurants, activities, friends, family and more) are much farther and it’s taking a toll on me. Where I was looking (which was still in my price range) those things would’ve been within 10-20 minutes of all of it and now with traffic it’s anywhere from 40min-over an hour. I’m a single 33 year old woman and I feel very alone in a somewhat of a suburb family area. There’s not a lot near me and I feel like I’m trapped. 

I’ve tried everything people have suggested: decorated my whole house, done projects, I painted my bathroom vanities, got my kitchen cabinets redone, changed hardware, started going to therapy, tried acclimating to the area and nothing has helped. 

I enjoy being a homeowner, I just don’t like this general area. This anxiety and sadness eats at me everyday. For my mental health I am considering listing it in the spring and trying to downsize and pray I can get into something else or sadly move back home with my parents and replenish my savings. 

Bought a 3bed/2 bath single family home for 430k. Roughly about 17k in upgrades (the kitchen, all new backyard, appliances, and more)

RealEstate,savings rate,"Our escrow company messed up our taxes the last couple years, and now want to double our monthly mortgage payments to pay it off and correct their mistake. What can we do?","** UPDATE** 

Thank you to those who gave kind, helpful replies. Based on some of the advice given here, we’ve come to a solid game plan to resolve this. 

We know we messed up as much as the mortgage company did. A very expensive lesson has been learned, and I wrote yesterday’s post in a bit of a panic to see what the options were to pay everything off at a lower rate. As so many of you have kindly pointed out, we will be double and triple checking the numbers and payments on our end for everything moving forward. 

To address some of the replies:

WE KNOW we have to, and are more than willing to, pay the taxes and replenish the shortage in escrow. We called the mortgage company to point out the steep jump in monthly costs from last year to this year, and they have granted us the option to spread the $6700 overage payments, plus our usual P&I, to over 36 months instead of the 12 months they initially outlined. 

We will also be looking into contacting our homeowners insurance to get our policy reevaluated and see if we can get it lower, or, possibly switch insurance companies all together. 

We do have some savings currently and will also work to try to pay down the shortage in a one lump sum to balance out the escrow, but this could take several months. In the meantime, the monthly payment was reduced to a manageable sum for our family budget to buy us this time. 

We will try to appeal our property valuation tax when we get our annual letter in the spring, as that usually gets sent to home owners in April and they give only the months of April & May of each year to appeal. With that said, despite us not having made any significant improvements to the house to warrant the tax increase, the real estate market here (as with most cities/states in the US) has been out of control and steadily increasing over the past 5 years. Our neighborhood has become much more desirable since we bought it over 10 years ago, so comparing the comps won’t be in our favor, but it’s worth a shot to at least try. 

Yes, having an escrow sucks and I’d like to separate the taxes & insurance from the mortgage, but we’d have to look into. I know when we first bought the house we did not qualify to do so. 

Thank you all again and have a great day! 




Hello, here’s the details: 

Husband and I have been homeowners for 10years, and refinanced 5 years ago to pay off his student loans. 

Mortgage was pretty consistent before and after refinancing, usually $1100/month. 

Well last year, we got the Escrow disclosure that showed they were going to lower our mortgage to $860, AND that we had an overage of $1200, so they sent us a check last spring. Great! Who doesn’t need more money & lower bills?! I am a stay at home mom and we are down to just husband’s income currently (I’m going back to work as soon as youngest starts kindergarten in 18months.) 

Well…yesterday, we got the escrow disclosure and they want to up the monthly mortgage from $860, to $1760!!! That’s more than double?! And we now have an overage of over $6700?!?!! So what the heck happened? Called escrow/mortgage and they said they noticed an increase to home insurance and a tax increase and to call my insurance & county tax office to sort it out. Ok! 

Call the county tax office, spoke with a very nice lady who looks up our house. Then she asks “did your mortgage go down last year?” Why yes! I say, yes it has! 

“I know exactly what happened. We (the county) send two tax bills to your mortgage company. Last year, the first tax bill was $2800 and change. The second one, clearly marked SUPPLEMENTAL TAX FEE was $20.29. It seems your mortgage company only used the $20.29 bill to project your taxes for 2024, thus explaining your overage and lowering monthly bill. Now what has happened is you still have the $2800 that needs to be paid off, PLUS this years projected taxes.”
(Note: our county reassessed property value of our house last year, and it jumped $50k!) 
Our taxes for 2025 are over $3300! 

Holy fuck. 

We know we have to pay our taxes, no question about it. But why did they miscalculate it? Why didn’t they catch it before cutting our check last year?! 
And more importantly, why do we have only one year to pay DOUBLE to pay off their mistake? (Which, by the way, we cannot afford. $1760 is pretty much one whole paycheck for our family and that would only leave us with half our budget for our household of two adults & two kids.)

What can we do as home owners to lower our monthly mortgage? Do we have any options? 

We are in Kentucky if that helps, would appreciate all the advice we can get, even if it’s just links/numbers to point us in the right direction. We are terrified of losing our house! Thank you!

RealEstate,savings rate,"I’m going to lose money on my house — sell at a loss, or rent at a loss?","UPDATE:

Thanks so much for all of the thoughtful input! We are planning to list the house for sale in March. We did not purchase this house with the intent of holding it as a decades-long investment, do not feel great about the financial fundamentals, and are not looking for the stresses of long distance landlording (especially once we start having kids).

That said, the real determinant for us will be whether we have to fork up a significant amount of cash for the mortgage payoff. If we can’t sell close to our breakeven price on a reasonable timeline, we will probably consider renting it out for a bit and seeing where the market goes.

To address a couple things I saw commonly — we will not be coming back to Austin. My husband and I met in New York and lived/studied/worked in the NYC area for 5 years, so we are comfortable with this being where we land. We are planning to rent out East for at least a year and will take our time saving up, getting know the neighborhoods & local market, etc.

Yes, I know an $85k loss is not insignificant. We both grew up in families that were frugal by necessity, for whom this would be a life changing sum of money. I have a degree in Finance and a career specifically in financial planning & personal finance… so I understand the magnitude of the loss, it has eaten at me. That said, here’s my cope: we are not real estate investors. All of our down payment money came from quick appreciation on a prior home that we knew was subject to market volatility. We have really enjoyed being homeowners and are grateful for the freedom to do whatever we want with our space. If we had been renting for the past 5 years, we would also have zero equity.

Thanks again for all of your helpfulness! Wish us luck when we go live this spring.


ORIGINAL POST:

My husband (27M) and I (28M) bought our house for $425k in Austin, TX in mid-2022 — worst possible market timing. We expected to be here for at least a few more years but alas, life has its ways. We are moving to the NYC area to put our roots down, and have goals to buy there and start a family in the next few years.

Based on our realtor’s estimate, our TX home value is down ~20% since we bought it… AKA our entire $85k down payment. Thankfully that money came from the sale of a prior home that appreciated wildly during COVID… so it’s not like we lost a bunch of money that we worked hard to save (still sucks though).

Best case, we sell at full list price and barely break even after paying off the mortgage. We come out of pocket for any seller concessions or price reduction.

We also have the option to rent. Our current mortgage exceeds the going rental rate by $500-$600/month. This also happens to be roughly the amount we pay down in principal each month — i.e. I could stomach this as “paying ourselves back” via principal recapture while renters cover the cost of interest, insurance, and taxes. However that’s before factoring in maintenance, repairs, property management…

We are financially very comfortable. We have plenty of room in our monthly budget to cover the difference and a healthy savings, but I think the question becomes, do we:

1) Take the ~$85k loss and get out from under the mortgage?

2) Rent at a $500-$600 “loss” (consider it $0 after principal recapture), hope we don’t have to finance major repairs, and wait for the market to rebound?",178,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1ho75ig/im_going_to_lose_money_on_my_house_sell_at_a_loss/,1735397433.0,just-a-dude-62,1ho75ig,advice_seeking
RealEstate,savings rate,"Realitors are crooks. Even the ""good"" ones suck.","Recently sold my home and am closing on my new one in less than a month with all contingencys satisfied.  Live in a very populated area within PA.  Not going to get more specific than that due to my second closing not being finalized yet.

I feel the need to share my experience because quite honestly I feel like I beat the system, all while not taking the advice of not only my realtor but also a couple others that I ""fired"" over the past 12 months.

I recently paid off my original home back at the end of 2024.  Shortly before that, I had the home appraised.  It came in at 279k.
My wife and I had some complaints about our property so we put together a plan to sell it.  We figured out it would take about 320k to have the budget for our dream home.  At our current savings rate, it was going to take us a couple years to come up with the difference.

I spoke with a couple realtors to see if they would be interested in trying to sell my home at above market value.  I was transparent about the appraisal.  Rather than putting the home up at the price I asked for they all tried to talk me down.  I essentially gave up on trying to sell the home and decided to wait a couple years to sell so I could save the money up.

Shortly after giving up, I received a cold call from a realtor.  Rather than sharing the appraisal, I said ""get me 320k after closing costs and I'll sell"".  He was a young guy and agreed.  He put me on a 5.5% commission that scaled to 7% if the property sold above 380k.

The property is listed at 345k and a month goes by.  Offers for 310k - 315k come in.  I decline all of them.  Agent is practically begging me to accept offers after week 2 but I didn't budge and didn't drop the price.  Agent is very fed up at the point.

At week 4 I receive an offer for 325k.  I tell the agent to decline.  He was very visibility irritated at this point but does as I ask.  Four days later, the same buyer comes in at full price.  Offer accepted.  Sold for 345k with 321k in my pocket after closing.

Moved into an apartment while we started looking for the new place.  Long story short, same realitor.  Got two properties under contact but they fell through do to inspections.  I saw about 50 places total before I locked down the one I have under contact now.  More flack from countless realtors.  Everyone just wants to make a deal and couldn't care less about the buyers and sellers.

The house that I will be closing on soon is past the inspection phase.  I've been low balling everyone and this deal was not an exception.  Managed to get a 1500 SQ foot house built in 2002 for 203k.  Needs the septic repaired but this is still much less than the 320k that I have to work with.  My realitor complained about putting in the low-ball offer.  The reason I consider him the good realitor is because he at least gave me the time of day and actually did what I asked.  The key moment for securing this home for 203k was when I told my realtor to have the deal expire the same day we wrote it.  I gave them what they asked for but didn't want the open houses to happen over the weekend).  Buyers agent probably said ""hey we might not have a better offer after the open house.  Better take it"".  That house is worth at least 315k.  They definitely priced it to start a bidding war originally.

Moral of the story... Realitors are a bunch of crooks.  Even the ""good"" ones will try to screw you out of the value of your property.  We have a flawed system that only rewards them for making a sale on the buyer and seller side.  This model turns good people into bloodsuckers.

They are not your friends.  Great deals can still be had today as long as you are willing to not let them bully you out of your homes worth or hard earned money.

That's the end of my rant.  Hope this helps someone have the confidence to go against the advice of there agent who only gets paid if a deal happens.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1lzc4fo/realitors_are_crooks_even_the_good_ones_suck/,1752464021.0,fire45er,1lzc4fo,not_advice_seeking
RealEstate,savings rate,Am I stupid to sell my house instead of rent it out at my 2.75% rate?,"Background:  I'm considering moving about 4 hours away from my current home for a better work/life balance for me and my family. 

Current house was purchased in 2019 for $479k, put 20% down on a 30 year mortgage at 2.75%. Current Zillow estimate puts the home price at $670-$704k. I owe $349k and have a mortgage payment of $1,851.
Without estimating all the fees and what goes into it, that's a difference of $351k on what I owe vs. what it's worth if I base its worth at $700k for the easy math. 

I'm looking at homes that are in the $900k-1.1m mark. Rates are obviously higher now.
In that price range, I could pull enough cash to put 20% down on my next home without needing to sell my home. I wouldn't love it because I'd obviously prefer to keep that cash elsewhere, but it's doable without depleting all my savings and investments (but would deplete it by about 50%, 401k not included).
Looking at it though let's say I buy a $1m home and put $200k down. That money could also be growing at a rate of 5-15%, so let's just  say I could make about $16k yearly return with that $200k if I invest it.
For financial context, I make approx. $400k yearly right now. However, at the new job I'd be moving in to, I expect to make $250-300k. I'll have less income and a higher mortgage. 

I'm estimating I could rent out my current home for approx. $2800-$3000 monthly (mortgage payment is $1,851☝️).

I don't think I'd make a great hands-on landlord with my schedule and how far away I'll be, so I'd have to hire a property management company.  Current home is 10 years old, so it's still in pretty good shape and so far maintenance has been pretty low. 

Just curious what everyone's perspectives are. I'm just winging it and really don't have a ton of experience with these things, so any advice from you guys is welcome. And if I missed anything to give context to the scenario, please let me know.  
Thank you guys!

Thank you all for the thoughtful answers.

RealEstate,savings rate,Listing agent perspective on Unrepresented Buyer sale ,"It’s been about 30 days since the buyer rule has happened, I thought I would give an update. I am a Realtor, and I primarily work as a listing agent, it’s probably 80% of all transactions. I stay very busy to the point where I don’t advertise myself, It’s all word-of-mouth.  I close about 110 properties a year, roughly $20 million. I live in an affordable area so I encounter a lot of first-time buyers. 

The listing agreement is signed first. I’ve decided I will not act as a dual agent on any transaction from here on out. I want to be able to represent the seller to the best of my ability, as they are still the one who is paying all of my commission, and sought me out first. I charge two different rates, what I charge to list, and what I charge to list and have an unrepresented buyer and perform the ministerial duties needed. 

The first transaction with an unrepresented buyer is getting ready to close. I’m seeing there are so many ways this thing can go sideways. At the start, I had my transaction coordinator go ahead and send out the email that outlines all of the dates and deadlines, and then since they’re unrepresented, they took it from there. I CC’d the title company and lender (we are not an attorney state) and made sure they had buyers info for the transaction. 

The actual contract negotiation was extremely one-sided, because the buyer told me they had to move fast and they really liked the property. The preapproval they sent was for 100k more than the purchase price, so we countered back full price no closing cost, and they took it. 

The buyer missed the earnest money deposit deadline by 3 days. Don’t drop that in the mail!  Seller could have kicked the contract but decided to give time instead. Buyer ordered a home inspection, completely ignoring the septic, well, gas, termite, radon. Cool, very easy negotiation for my seller. 

They called me panicked about insurance. That deadline is passed so they are now getting whatever insurance they can. Financing deadline is passed, so earnest money is now nonrefundable. On the counter offer I told the seller let’s double it and tighten it up.  

Didn’t order a survey. 

Didn’t add the HOA rider. 

Missed or didn’t care the roof has 2-5 years of life left so didn’t ask for that. 

All of these things add up to be far more than the 2.5-3% a buyers agent charges around here. Seller was counting on paying that, pretty happy they saved 1.5%.  While it was not a ton of additional work on my side, it IS a lot of liability. On the next one, what happens if buyer missed the earnest money deadline, and the seller decides to kick the contract out, then the buyer gets upset that I didn’t remind them a second time to deposit the check in person?  Or when they send me the inspection report and I see several large items that they didn’t ask for, it’s not my responsibility to guide them. I can already see a disgruntled buyer starting a lawsuit for me doing my job, which is to represent the seller interests only. 

I have two more that are currently under contract where I’m representing the seller and buyer is unrepresented, I will be curious to see if buyer unforced errors like this continue. 

From my perspective - which is one where I actually make MORE money if the buyer is unrepresented - please, please hire a competent agent to represent you. There is no reason a first time buyer should attempt this in an effort to “save” money.

RealEstate,savings rate,Are house prices ever likely to be reasonable again in Florida?,"I live in Florida and have been saving to buy for 13 years. Didn't make enough before Covid and then prices basically doubled in the last 4 years along with rates of course.

I keep hearing that prices are going down, but I haven't seen this. Lately I've been seeing houses sell and then literally 6 months or a year later, they're back on the market for $65-100k increase in price, with no updating noted in the listing.

Just doesn't feel like I can ever meet my goal to own a home. I only make about $70k a year, but my monthly guaranteed take home (without bonuses) is only about $4k. I finally got a $10k raise last year, ahd it seemed to help a little, but it would still be really tight to buy a home, and I'm not sure I'd be able to meet my retirement goals while doing so.

Just feels like I'm spinning my wheels. With the slowdown in home sales, I was hoping we'd see more of a correction start in Florida due to all of the issues converging - high prices, high rates, increasing insurance costs, longer times on the market, etc, but I'm only seeing minuscule price drops that don't help much with the monthly payment, even though some homes have been on the market for many months.

I realize I mostly missed the boat in my early 30s, and that's my fault of course, but I was hoping I'd get a second chance in my late 30s, at least. Now it looks like I may have to wait until late 40s/50s if anything eases up, and won't have time to pay it off before retirement, which I really really need to be able to retire.",12,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1kxvb51/are_house_prices_ever_likely_to_be_reasonable/,1748473305.0,Spiritual-Revenue-73,1kxvb51,advice_seeking
RealEstate,build emergency fund,I am so scared of being house poor in this climate while my wife wants to buy this home in Northern IL,"I apologize in advance for this long read. I'm just really scared and my anxious brain is freaking out and I could use some guidance from those who are wiser than me. I ask you to please be kind as I'm just a regular dude trying to do the best I can at life and come from both sides of our family who went through foreclosures and severe mental health issues. 

My wife (40) and I (37) have been looking on redfin for a little while and saw this house come up that we thought was a gem. We were a backup offer and the first offer fell through and we were next in line. 
The house is a short sale in our neighborhood that's a SFH with a bank pre-approved purchase of $385k ~3600 sqft - 4 bedrooms + large flex space + basement and a normal backyard (though it is all grass, no patio and no fence) + 3 car garage. According to the listing agent, the short sale bank did an appraisal and it came back at $417K. We live in a high property tax state, so the property taxes on the home would be about $13,500/yr. The bank did an appraisal and that came back at $415K. The house was built in 2005 and everything is all original meaning it's dated. The roof is original and hvac but we paid for an inspector who does thorough work and they said the hvac is throwing really good numbers for efficiency + CO2. The roof appears to be in great condition but of course it is at the time that insurance companies do not like (20 years). The report came back with 33 issues (many minor from changing lights to the roof and hvac from only a time perspective) and the inspector said in this area the average issues they see on a home this size is ~70 items so this house is pretty good from what they see. 

We currently live in a 3bdroom/2bath townhouse (no basement) ~1800 sqft townhome that backs up to a pond. Was lovely at the time but with our 3yo son and trying for another, and both WFH, we wished we had more space pretty soon after the birth of our child.

Some considerations to add is that our parents are both elderly in their 70's and both sets of parents have little to no savings. We're both being placed in a situation of trying to help take care of them in their old age as well in a few years. I know a lot of times people will ask did your parents ask this of you or are you assuming, and they've asked. It's a shitty burden to have but it's here. The flex space could have doors put in and be turned into a bedroom easily. The half bath is humongous and can easily have room for a shower to be added in down the line. 

Just to give an idea, a house down the block that is a bit bigger and more done (first floor was redone and has the patio and driveway redone with more modern updates) is selling for $490k (5 beds, 4200 sqft). A smaller home (4 beds, 2760 sqft) sold for $425k. New builds in the area that are smaller but SFH (3 bed, 2.5 ba, 2 car garage ~2600 sqft are going for $650K). Homes in this area are still going above asking but it does seem to be slowing here a bit. 

We would plan to keep our current townhouse and try renting it out. Our mortgage with HOA is ~2k/mo and we feel like we can get $2,500/mo based on rentals in the area. We have a low rate on it (~2.9%) and purchased it at $195k with a remaining mortgage of $167K and if we were to sell it think we can get around $275K-290K based on listings in our neighborhood.

Our new mortgage with putting 5% down would be $4,000 PITI. We could put 10% down but i am scared of emptying out our brokerage. Since the house is already appraised for more than buying, I am hoping I can get rid of the PMI sooner rather than later. 

I look at this budget and know we have been way overspending on things and have let lifestyle creep come in. My wife says that she is happy to cancel amazon and stop buying frivolous toys and things for our child to make it work. She truly believes if we let this house go, we won't be able to get into another SFH that offers us all the good bones this house has (great open layout with loads of natural light, good school (same school as us currently), and more than enough space for us to never outgrow).
For her, saying no to this house means saying no to a second child and SFH lifestyle. My wife and i both do YNAB and look at our budget regularly so it isn't as if the burden is on one person. I have a high degree of anxiety and fear of job less (since working FT in 2009, i had one job loss, my wife has never had a job loss). I acknowledge that if it was up to me, we'd still be in our 1 bedroom apartment we were renting because I am too afraid of taking risks. It bit us again in the butt during the pandemic when we bought this townhouse and should have purchased something bigger. My wife insists that we have more financial levers to pull than many others and we need to take this leap and give it a go. 

One thing to note here is that my wife is happy with selling our townhouse. I am the one who wants to keep it because my anxious brain keeps telling me that if this big house is too much for us, we can make it work for a year or two but if we need to move into our old place where we know our housing cost is much lower, we can. The new home is only a 5 minute drive from the townhouse. Likewise my wife's parents recently moved here and are renters and we might be able to rent it to them (we know the risks with family and are close enough to our parents to talk these through). 

Are we crazy to make this jump? Am I crazy for trying to keep our townhouse? My wife is telling me that she understands if we don't go forward but she will always feel like we missed our chance. She's stated that it sucks for us to live ""small, safe"" lives because of me due to me always wanting to be as financially secure as we can be. I sort of feel like if i buy this house, I am sacrificing all the safety we've built through the years. If we don't buy this house, i'm sacrificing the relationship with my wife and the resentment this will create for the rest of our lives.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1kio85z/i_am_so_scared_of_being_house_poor_in_this/,1746811743.0,OEdreamer,1kio85z,advice_seeking
RealEstate,build emergency fund,Should we pull out of new build now?,"Title. Looking for opinions. In December we put a deposit down for a lot with a builder who’s developing a large neighborhood nearby. Best school district in the area, great looking homes, builder is well established in this area. Base price of the home is $500,000. We negotiated a 12 month rate lock at 6.5% with our preferred lender. We should be at CO by within 12 months hopefully. We’re renting currently. The mortgage, taxes and insurance should be about $3000 a month, at least until taxes and insurance increase. 

Currently single income base salary of $170,000. WFH no commute. Wife is SAHM for another 6 months then will re-enter the job market once kiddo goes to pre-school. She has high early potential. I am on a generous vesting schedule and large annual bonus which are not worked into my base salary but those help bolster savings in our HYSA. We have ZERO debt. We’re putting down 20%. 

All that said, with the timing, I’m concerned that prices will increase beyond our current comfort zone due to tariffs. Everyone is saying building prices will go up. With our budget and savings we can swing up to a 5% increase without digging into our emergency fund. 

We can pull out now, we would only lose $2000 on the deposit. I’m nervous the price is going to jump like 25% which i am not comfortable with. Should we cut our losses now and keep stacking savings, or wait and see? I’m also worried that if we pull out now, we will be outpaced by the market yet again in a year or two. We’ve been trying to get into a house for 5 years.

RealEstate,build emergency fund,Buy Starter Home Now or Keep Renting to Crush Student Loans?,"My fiancée (24F) and I (25M) are both doctors of physical therapy. I recently graduated and started working full-time with a salary of around $80k/year. She is finishing her program and will graduate next June, with a similar starting income expected. We’re getting married in June 2026 and currently live in my step-dad’s old house. He’s giving us a great deal on rent — only $500/month — and has expressed interest in selling the home to us, estimated around $250k. The house is a small 2-bedroom, 1-bath in a good location. While it’s not what we envision as our long-term family home, it’s livable and could potentially serve as a starter home or future rental.

Right now, our combined student loan debt is about $105,000 ($75k mine and $30k hers). I’m currently paying $1,500/month toward my loans while also saving for our wedding, investing modestly, and building an emergency fund. Between savings and investments, we currently have around $20,000. Long-term, we hope to purchase a \~$500k forever home within 5–8 years where we can raise a family. Our main financial goal is to pay off our student loans within 3–4 years, continue saving and investing, and eventually purchase that long-term home once we’re financially ready.

Our dilemma is this: should we plan to buy the house we’re currently living in sometime in the next year or two to begin building equity early, or continue renting at the low rate of $500/month so we can aggressively pay down student loans and save for a down payment on our future forever home? Buying the house could allow us to get into real estate early, possibly convert it into a rental later, and take advantage of a relatively smooth family sale. On the other hand, we’re concerned about tying up cash flow during a time when we’re trying to eliminate debt and save aggressively. We’d love to hear advice from others who’ve been in similar situations, especially regarding the trade-offs between early homeownership, student loan payoff, and long-term wealth building.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1lv62vn/buy_starter_home_now_or_keep_renting_to_crush/,1752024003.0,Final-Weakness6413,1lv62vn,advice_seeking
RealEstate,build emergency fund,Is This Condo Purchase Financially Risky? Reserve Gaps & Roof Replacements,"I’m considering buying into a 10-year-old condo community—townhome-style units in a mid-size HOA—with some financial flags I could use help interpreting.

The property looks good on the surface, but:

• Roof replacements are happening this summer for 3 buildings, even though there’s no reported leakage.

• All units are getting attic vent replacements and minor roof work to stop ongoing patch repairs.

• The HOA (38% reserve funding) dipped into their monthly operating funds last year to cover emergency roof repairs—about $15K—rather than using reserves.

• Right now, monthly dues are $430, but only $150 of that goes into reserves. The reserve study recommends contributing closer to $350/month/unit, meaning there’s a sizable gap. I’m pretty sure HOA won’t agree to it.

• If they don’t increase funding, future special assessments could run $15K–$22K per unit, especially as full roof replacements are scheduled for 2040. That does not seem too drastic right now…

• Management is changing this August, and the board is also reviewing landscaping contracts—so there’s hope for cost optimization.


I know HOAs tend to hit big maintenance cycles around the 10–15 year mark, but this feels like it’s coming on fast.

Is this kind of reserve shortfall and early roof replacement normal for a 10-year-old property? Would you walk away, or negotiate hard and brace for future assessments? ( I was able to bring price down by 15k )

Overall, the unit I am looking at seems very clean and Inspection came through with some minor cosmetics issues, which caller got fixed.

Looking for perspectives from anyone who’s gone through this or dealt with underfunded HOAs. Thanks!",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1lxurvt/is_this_condo_purchase_financially_risky_reserve/,1752306159.0,jeb_indian,1lxurvt,advice_seeking

- Opportunity to purchase indoor  deeded parking down the line in building.
- Possibility of a new nearby stadium being built driving up tourism & businesses in the area.
- No rental cap in the building potential for future appreciation. 
- Low property taxes & HOA 

Cons 

- Withdraw some money invested into Roth IRA 
- Little reserves for emergency fund due to being used for a downpayment. Around 11-14k left over closing costs included. 

- Can’t save as much as staying home (Around 2k left over compared to me currently saving 3-4k a month)

- Can’t purchase furnishing items right away. Want to build back up reserves.

RealEstate,build emergency fund,"Downfall of HOA, flip tax solution ?","Is the Florida condo market, condo market in general, saveable with flip taxes? I mean no one likes to pay hoas and wouldn't want to pay part of sales profit or dues into a reserve or emergency fund but for struggling buildings and future repairs a sale fee would significantly help.

Why haven't more complexes and hoa associations taken on flip taxes or dues paid by sellers that go to the building reserve or emergency fund when properties are sold?

Most hoa boards charged tenants little to no money so decades later major projects need a lot of funding and hoas fees get out of control to the point where buyers won't buy. It seems like the Fl condo market, possibly larger national condo market is at serious risk linked to rocketing hoas linked to deferred maintenance and inadequate long term planning. 

Past owners in townhouse, high rises, apartment style homes, or gated communities with  amenities, often paid something like 1-4k  a year in hoas and are now shocked that wasn't enough to maintain a building or multiple acres of land plus amenities.

1 to 4k really isn't enough to do basic upkeep and add into a reserve or emergency fund... Insurance, grounds keeping, plumbing, exterior siding and roofing, spraying for pests indoors and outdoors, maintaining private parks, pools, tennis basketball courts, recreation rooms, clerical staff, maintenance staff, security staff or security contracts, vehicles,  energy costs like electricity, heating, gas, oil for shared spaces these things add up...to more than 100 to 300 a month...it's just common sense.

Most hoas didn't charge residents enough to factor in repairs per unit for larger longer needs. A lot of larger places wait every 10 to 30 years to do large projects...or do nothing until things are falling apart/ dangerous. 

owners get hit on both ends they have to pay the assessment and their home value will continue to drop...vs every buyer paying reserve emergency dues when selling etc. 

Millions of dollars in the condo market are being wiped out in the blink of eye bc buildings are being held accountable for maintenance which really should have been happening the entire time.

Buyers that are recent within the last 10 yrs get screwed as they inherited poor physical and financial conditions and are forced to take on more debt.. Another way that boomers had it easier.

We've been in a bad financial spot for years and are just now starting to climb out. We only have about 6K saved between savings and retirement (again, just starting to rebuild) and feel as if the prospect of us getting a home for our family is gone. By the time we're able to save up for a house, we won't need a house. Things are just so expensive and I dont see how we can save 100's of thousands. Is it too late for us? Are we just relegated to just living in this condo until her mom passes and we're able to sell (don't mean to sound callous, just being objective)? 

What else do I need to thinking about?

RealEstate,saving for retirement,Update to owner died 19 days before settlement,"Original post:
https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/s/nkLYuGJHNn

We did it! Yesterday was settlement. 

My mother in-law died suddenly on 7/5/2025. Her home was under contract with a settlement date of 7/24/2025. Most people who commented thought 1) we needed an attorney and 2) we would not be able to sell the home in 19 days. Both proved incorrect. I hope this feedback helps anyone in this situation moving forward.

We did consult an attorney. Before I comment on why we didn't hire an attorney, I'll give some background. My wife and I are not unsophisticated people. I am recently retired and she is still working .Given that I am retired, we took this as a challenge for me. I did as much of the leg work as I could legally. 

Our realtor recommended an attorney. We did a conference call to discuss the situation. MIL died in an assisted living facility in Burlington County and the home was in Gloucester County. She didn't change her address yet. The attorney could not answer my first question... Where will the will be probated? He said that's a complex situation that he required a retainer and hourly billing for his ""research."" Really?? We didn't have time for any research.

After that conference call, I immediately called the Gloucester County Surrogate and explained the circumstances. The clerk told me definitively that we could file the will in her county. So much for research. She also explained the process. Once the will is filed, they could get us short certificates in two business days. 

We called the funeral director and I offered to pickup the death certificates to save time. We (nicely) explained the circumstances and she agreed to expedite the certificates. I had them three days later and we had an appointment with the surrogate the next business day. The clerk at the Surrogate's office could not have been nicer. 

As promised, the short certificates, and letters of testamentary, were ready in two business days. I picked them up. Within an hour, the title clerk had everything she needed. 

Ironically, the only hiccup we had was with the Certificate of Occupancy. According to our realtor, the township office had ""a reputation."" This proved to be correct. I'll spare you the details. We received a Certificate of Occupancy less than 24 hours prior to settlement. 

We obtained an EIN number and setup an estate account. My wife has an appointment to deposit checks into that account this morning. 

All of this happened before the memorial service, which is tomorrow. It was an emotional struggle for my wife but it helped with closure. I hope this helps anyone who finds themselves in a similar situation.  

Edit: I removed the references to our professions because it triggered a couple people. I didn't expect that. Sorry for those distractions. ",333,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1m8zc26/update_to_owner_died_19_days_before_settlement/,1753450502.0,78YZ125,1m8zc26,not_advice_seeking
RealEstate,saving for retirement,How long would you stay in a mortgage free house?,"Update: additional background info, we have no other debt and a robust retirement savings (around double what the national average is for folks inthier 60s for each of us, and we're in our mid 30s). The kids range from 12m to 9yr and it's two boys, two girls, we're planning to keep shared bedrooms even if we were to move to a slightly larger home. The area we currently live in (west) is more expensive than the area we commute to for all the things (east) so a home of the same or only slightly larger square footage would put us making money or breaking even. At this point we're definitely thinking a middle ground solution is best, saving for a year or so and then moving so we can benefit from the saving opportunity of having a paid off home without sacrificing a full 4/5yrs of 20+ hrs a week of driving. 

So we own our home outright, no mortgage. We have 4 kids and the home is a 3 bed/2.5 bath, 1600 sq feet with a decent sized back yard, no bike able trail access (have to load kids and bikes in the car). We have the garage used as storage, home office and sewing space. We're driving about 35 minutes twice a day to take the kids to and from school and work, 20 minutes each way about 3 times a week to visit family, 25 minutes each way for church about 3 times a week plus any extra trips to visit friends or go to events in the east side of town (we live on the west side). There are larger homes available within 5-10 minutes of family, school, work, church, trail access, etc. that we regularly go to, within 100k of what we can expect to get for this home upon selling. 
Would those be good enough reasons for you to move out of a mortgage free home? Or would you wait till you saved enough to close the 100k gap and effectively buy the next house cash? 
Background info on the dynamics:
I (wife) would like to move to gain more time throughout the week by reducing travel and being close to family and friends as well as having dedicated space painting (book illustration and commissions).
Husband would like to stay put and save for a few more years and move once our youngest starts school and I'm bringing in a full time paycheck.

RealEstate,saving for retirement,"What to do: can’t afford to sell, can’t stay.","We purchased this home in WA state almost a year ago with the intention of staying for a long time. 
Circumstances changed, poor mental health, pregnant with baby number 2 and no support, I’m now planning on moving home to Australia. Husband in the military will be joining me in 3ish years when he retires. 

We paid $485k for the home, Va loan, 5.45%, our mortgage amount currently owing is $502,000 thanks to rolling the VA fee into it.
we have been fixing the home up to sell it, have put in about 15k, but it still isn’t updated enough for a premium price and due to crappy contractors hired, the finish on some things is not great. 
We’ve maxed our budget for fixing things and can do no more. The house has more issues than we thought when we purchased. Inspector missed things, I think seller had tried to hide problems. 

I spoke to the realtor we purchased through, she said to break even we would need to list/sell at $541,000 and that’s with her giving us a discount on her commission. But if she didn’t know our finances she would have only list it for $525,000. She also said the market has slowed. 

We toyed with the idea of renting it out but we’d be out of pocket about 600 minimum per month before any utilities or maintenance. Doesn’t seem feasible option. 

I want to just give the keys to the lender and walk away. 
I don’t care about my credit score here, I want to go home ASAP as I’m struggling super hard being here with my husband on deployments, living in this house is just depressing.

My husband would prefer to try and sell it, save his credit score incase he needs to rent in the coming years to avoid living on the ship or unaccompanied housing. And take out a separate loan for the difference and pay it off over the next 4 years. Potentially $20k on top of the $15k loan we already have for our renovations. 

Are there any implications to a deed in lieu or foreclosure to military personnel, tax issues? or is it quite literally tanking your credit score and making it impossible to get a loan again for a number of years? 
Should I consult a real estate lawyer to find out more? Or should I let my husband add more debt to our acc to get us out of this mess? 
Appreciate any advice given. I’m an emotional mess atm and I only see one way out. 

Update: appreciate the advice given, we’re not going to do anything to harm my husbands credit or his career, we’re going to try list it for just under break even and as va assumable, and maybe negotiate buyer commission. If we don’t have any good feelings of it selling after a month or so, we will try rent it out so I can atleast leave and be happier. Either option, we’re out of pocket but hopefully we can minimize the amount. Thank you !

RealEstate,saving for retirement,"Weird buyers, off market listing","TLDR: regret showing my house off market to my neighbors parents who seem to want to take advantage in every way possible. Mostly a rant, also a reminder that getting buyers and sellers together without agents can backfire.

My house is off market, but our neighbor across the street found out we are moving and selling soon. Apparently, their parents want to live closer to them. 

I had offered them to see it off-market (now I'm kicking myself for this). We were hoping, OK maybe they don't have an agent and my realtor could save us some commission by working as a contract negotiator. Turns out, they have a family friend of 35-40+ years who will represent them. Fine.

When speaking with my agent on the phone, the buyer is already trying to ""wheel and deal"" as my agent put it, telling her that ""oh your listing price is 20k higher than this other house that sold in the neighborhood."" I know for a fact houses in this neighborhood have been sold for higher than our list, too. Guy asks if he can just go over and look, since his agent is on vacation. Mine says absolutely not, so they set up an appointment when his agent is back in town.

I should add: We're in a sellers market (metro Detroit). Maybe it's not as hot as 2022 was, but inventory is still very low and the summer market seems to be really turning out a lot more demand than a couple of months ago.

Anyway, guy comes over to see the house. Seems to like it. His wife was sick that day, so they come back a few days later to view again, bring their daughter and granddaughter who live across the street. Say they like the house, even though it's not the ranch they'd hoped for (2 stories plus basement) they want to be by their daughter. After 2nd showing, I find the panel behind the main bath shower pried open, obviously they tried to do this with fingers, not tools. (Annoying, could have waited for an inspection??) But whatever.

Next day, they put in an offer. 15k under ask (all cash, mind you)  and an extortionate rent buy back (2x cost of our mortgage). No thanks. Also, I'm not ready to be under contract with anyone, which is why my house is not on the market. I'm waiting for a visa appointment to join my husband abroad. 
So our agent tells them our feedback on the offer and lets them know that we will give them a heads up when we are listing as a courtesy.

Fast forward about 2 weeks. This weekend, I'm outside working on my front flower beds when I hear someone calling out to me across the street ""hey neighbor! Please don't run away, I want to talk to you!"" I'm thinking ""oh no... this is one of the people who put in an offer..."" 

YEP: sure enough it's the neighbors mom. She asked me if it was OK to talk to me, which I should have just shut down but I had no words at the time. I didn't say yes, but she proceeds to apologize for the rent buyback in the contract (wasn't her idea, was her husband's and the agent's!), asks about my baby grand piano and how she's always wanted one of that particular brand. Basically says she knows that they are expensive and she's never had the money for one (I paid 5k for it used; I'm sure if this couple has the money to buy a house cash without having to sell their current one, they could make it happen if it was such a priority).

Next she tells me how her family was musical (that's nice I guess) and how she fled Slovakia as a child and came to the US in 1952 at six years old. I think the implication was that she is a poor immigrant who I should feel sorry for? Maybe not, but it's kind of how I took it. 
She seemed very surprised to learn that I myself am an immigrant, to which she says ""oh! So we're the same!""
Tells me how she would love to live next to her daughter, etc. Asks what's going on with my visa process... As if I'm not sick of hearing these questions from all my friends and family, now I have a potential buyer coming to my door badgering me about it!

She also expresses that ""we should talk more, yes! Let's talk again soon!""

After reflecting on her conversation with me, I became pretty annoyed the next day. As an immigrant of modest means myself, I found it a bit weird hearing an immigrant hardship story from someone who grew up under America's greatest economic expansion, who came to the US at age 6, no less. Not to mention, my parents retired to Portugal in 2018, because they knew that they could not afford to retire here in the US. I see them every other year now. And here I have a lady who wants to buy my house to live across the street from her daughter suggesting that I'm so privileged in relation to her. Of course, this lady could not know all this about me, but obviously she thought she was being clever trying to butter me up or something... maybe she was hoping I'd agree to let them make another offer before I put the house on the market. 😅

I asked my agent to reach out to theirs and tell them not to contact me directly again. Apparently their agent's reaction was ""yikes!"" when he heard that they had approached me. 

My husband's response to all this when I told him was ""sounds like the price just went up 10k for these people"" 🙃",93,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1lpj40k/weird_buyers_off_market_listing/,1751419157.0,veggieviolinist2,1lpj40k,advice_seeking
RealEstate,saving for retirement,Two 23-Year-Olds Bought Ruins in the Azores — What Do You Think?,"My best friend and I (both 23) just bought a ruins property in **Nordeste, Azores (Portugal)** for €75,000 (\~$81K USD). It's literally just stone walls — no roof, plumbing, or electricity — but it's on a beautiful plot of land with ocean views and a ton of potential.

We're both based in NYC and love traveling. He works in investment banking and just put down the €23K deposit. I work in art investments (but actively job hunting). I have $25K in savings and around $75K in retirement accounts. We both have good credit and were each able to secure **$20K loans from our parents** to help complete the purchase.

The idea is:

* Finish purchasing the property with our own savings + family loans.
* Secure financing to renovate (exact cost TBD but likely €60K–€100K).
* Once renovated, refinance based on the new value.
* Rent it out either as a short-term vacation rental or long-term stay.
* Use it ourselves a few times a year as a creative retreat/home base in Europe.

We know it’s risky — especially as first-time renovators and remote owners — but we’re excited. At worst, we see it as a relatively cheap way to own land and experience something meaningful before life gets more complicated.

**So… What do you think?**

* Are we crazy or just early?
* Does this plan make sense to you financially?
* Have you renovated a property abroad before? What should we watch out for?
* Would this kind of place even rent well in rural Azores?

RealEstate,saving for retirement,Need Advice: Buy Bigger House Now with High Rate or Wait?,"Looking for some input—we're feeling stuck on a big decision.

We bought our current house in 2021 and locked in a great 2.8% interest rate. It's a 4 bed, 2 bath, about 1,800 sq ft. We’ve built around $80K in equity since then.
The issue is that our family has grown—we now have 4 kids—and we’re starting to outgrow the space. We can still manage for now; it’s not unbearable, but it’s definitely getting tighter and will only get more difficult as the kids grow.

Recently, we found a house that’s double the size of what we have now. It’s a great deal: around $102 per square foot in a market where homes typically go for $130–$140. It would also come with about $10K–$20K in instant equity based on comps.

The catch? With current interest rates, the monthly payment would be nearly double what we’re paying now. We could make it work, but it would be tight for about a year until our income increases.

We’re torn. A few things we’re considering:

If we sell the current house, we lose the 2.8% rate, but we’d walk away with $80K in equity.

Renting it out might be an option, but I’m not sure how strong rental demand is in our area, or if the rent would fully cover the mortgage.

Another idea is to pull out the equity and invest it instead—maybe get ~10% returns annually, which feels better than just leaving it in the house.

If we wait until we’re more financially ready, we might be paying $140–$150 per square foot—much higher than this deal.

Feels like we’re catching the market at a low, but the cost of capital is high. Do we bite the bullet now, or stay put and risk getting priced out later?

Would love to hear your thoughts—especially from anyone who's faced a similar situation.

RealEstate,saving for retirement,Should I buy the larger house or the regular sized home?,"We are in the market to purchase a home; we just sold our apartment that had no mortgage and a seven figure sale price.  The issue: we have two kids, ages 8 and 10, and I don't know whether to buy a home that has rooms that are good for kids, i.e., 10x10, or the home that will be good for young adults, larger rooms and more places to be alone in the home.  In effect, I am looking at homes that are around 2200 or 3000 square feet.  The reason that this is a problem for us is that we could buy a 2200 square foot home in cash and would have to take out a mortgage for the larger home.  In terms of money, the larger house will cost around 2,500 extra per month.  We have a household income of well over 300k and very little debt, but we want to plow extra income into retirement savings.  Ultimately, I would like a home that my kids could live in as young adults, but my wife believes that they will move out when they are young adults so we're probably better off with a smaller home.

RealEstate,50/30/20 rule,Can We Stop Pretending Housing Prices Have Doubled Everywhere Since 2020?,"I keep seeing this narrative floating around “We missed the boat. Should’ve bought in 2020. Prices have doubled since then!” and honestly, it’s getting a bit out of hand.

Let’s take a breath and look at the numbers.

Yes, housing prices have gone up. In many areas, we’ve seen 30-40% increases. Some hot markets may have touched 50%. But doubling? That’s the exception, not the rule. If you dig into actual data, it’s clear this idea that the average home has gone up 100% in 4 years is a myth.

For example, take Phoenix as an example. Which is considered one of the hottest market post pandemic.  In 2020, the median sale price was around $320K. In 2025, it’s closer to $450K. That’s a ~45% increase. Substantial? Yes. Insane? Not really.

Sure, a few specific homes in extremely desirable locations may have seen huge appreciation. But broad claims like “everything has doubled” just don’t hold up. And even during the so-called “affordable” years, housing wasn’t cheap relative to income, affordability has been a problem for the past 20 years, not just since COVID.

If you’re in the market, don’t let the hype mess with your head. Do your research, look at comps, understand your local market, and block out the noise.

RealEstate,pay off debt,Sellers lied about solar panels being paid off and now refusing any solution,"UPDATE: 9/27/24
they are now trying to give us only 3k credit. Opinions?
—————————————————————————————

(from Long Island, NY) We are first time home buyers in the worst situation. The contract is already signed and the seller always told our agent that the solar panels were paid off.
Turns out they lied and there was a lien on the home and the panels went into bankruptcy because they couldn't afford them. They were leased to own so they had to pay monthly till they own them. To outright buy the panels it's 14k. (a ucc3 was filed and the LIEN IS REMOVED)

Mind you they are 10 years old. Why would we want additional debt on old panels.

We don't know what to do, they refuse to credit us in any way. The contract has been signed and we don't want to lose our deposit of 50k because they outright lied about owning the panels. Also in our contract it says

""60. (delete if not applicable) In the event there are currently solar panels installed on the house the buyers) agree to take the premises in its existing condition and will assume the responsibility of the monthly payments for the duration of the contract under its current terms and conditions and/or Lease Transter Agreement. If the title company requires a OCC Financing Statement Amendment (Form UCC3) to be file prior to closing to clear any existing liens subject to the solar panels, the buyer agrees to sign any documents required by the solar panel company to effectuate said transfer of the existing contract into the buyer's name.”

the lawyer and my agent told us that this is normal since we want to own them, and we didn't think much of it since we were told they were paid off.

After weeks of arguing with the sellers my lawyer emailed me the attached. What should we do?

Email:

This is the current scenario...
1. To payoff the panels, and own them outright, the price would be around $14,500
2. To payoff the next year service would be around $6,500
3. If you chose not to utilize the service and activate the panels, your cost would be $0 (you could remove the panels at any time without a fee to Sunrun)
I suspect that in the very near future, the seller will issue a Time of the Essence letter and try to force us to close.
At that time, our options would be the following:
1. Agree to close and elect one of the options above, or,
2. Reject the TOE, under the argument that they misrepresented the balance and costs of the panels.
If you choose the 2nd option, they would likely seek to default us and liquidate the deposit. You would then have to initiate a legal action to dispute their claim.
I cannot guarantee how a court would decide this, but I can tell you that it would be time consuming and costly.
I have informed the seller's attorney that you do not desire to pay anything to Sunrun. I suggested that they issue a credit to you. They have refused.

We are at an impasse.




EDIT:

this is the current correspondence between the lawyers 

Lance- my lawyer

Gerri - sellers lawyer.


Gerri: 
Lance,
Your client signed a contract agreeing to assume the balance of the solar contract. I’m not aware of the discussions that took place between the parties, however Buyer should not be relying on any representations made by the agents or the sellers and are responsible for doing their own due diligence. 
Additionally, the solar panels were not operating at the time of contract, which is the same condition they are in now. 

If the seller owned them outright, then there wouldn’t be a monitoring or servicing agreement, so your client would still be responsible for purchasing a plan. 

Additionally, sun run advised that your client has continuously stated that they want nothing to do with the solar panels  

What is the resolution your client is looking for here? 

Lance:
I’ve said this several times. 

They do not want to accept these panels with any balance due upon them, as was represented to them. 

Your client can provide a credit to the buyers for the cost of the panels, which would put the buyers in the position that they would have been if your client’s representations were accurate. 

They want nothing more than what they bargained for. 

Gerri:

What they bargained for? What about the terms of the contract that they reviewed, signed and agreed to? 

Please clarify, is buyer requesting:
A credit for the estimated pre-payment of solar use for the remainder of the of the term which is $6184 and includes the monitoring and maintenance plan; or 
A credit for outright purchase of the equipment which is $14,187 and does not include a monitoring and maintenance plan (This is essentially what exists now at no cost to anyone since it was discharged in bankruptcy)


Lance:
Option 2.

Gerri:
Your clients are trying for a money grab at this point. The result of option 2 would put them in the same situation as presently exists. Solar panels on roof with no monitoring or maintenance contract. 

Lance:
Or, would allow them to renew the contract, pay the service fees, and utilize the panels. 

They are not looking for more than they negotiated for. 

Your client can also elect to terminate this contract and return the deposit, if they wish. 


End of emails.

The only proof we have is a email from the sellers lawyer admitting that he was trying to obtain a payoff letter but found out theirs bankruptcy.

Their lawyers email:
Lance,
After not having success in obtaining the payoff and UCC3 and in further speaking with the sellers, we are advised that both the 2d mortgage and solar panels were discharged as part of a bankruptcy which sellers didn't previously disclose to us as they interpreted this to mean that both accounts were satisfied. We are requesting a lien release from BofA and have submitted a request to the bankruptcy department at Sunrun to determine what our options are to proceed. The solar agreement was a Power Purchase Agreement through 4/1/2035. Would buyer's consider assuming the solar agreement? I don't believe we will have sufficient funds to payoff the solar loan.

RealEstate,pay off debt,Pending Closing: Pay off Revolving Debt or Save,"Currently pending financing through lender (pre approved VA loan). Seems to be a mess so far with selling my current house, which is enrolled in DNRP, and trying to keep my DTI manageable with two mortgage payments on the application. Current house is on the market but we just put in an offer on a home with a closing date of mid-December (scheduled to move in Jan). Anyhow, looking to get a second opinion from a lender standpoint on either saving extra income for assets on hand/closing costs or paying off some more revolving debt to help with DTI. Without the second mortgage attached I’m sitting right around 40% DTI but that second mortgage really blows me out of the water and puts me closer to 50 or a little over. No issues with stable income and I drop child support on my two kids in a few months, which will really drop my DTI, but that doesn’t really help me right now. Just looking for a little insight.

RealEstate,pay off debt,Ever Been Screwed 24 Hours Before Closing? What Are The Odd of Happening Twice.,"I’m trying to sell my house, and I’m done.
This is the second time a buyer’s hidden financial mess has blown up the deal at the final hour. I’ve lost time, money, and now — possibly — my entire relocation plan.

Here’s what just happened:

Buyer was under contract. Closing scheduled for 6/16.

6/16: Lender pulls final credit report. Buyer’s score is 2 points too low.

Buyer pays off some debt. Credit score updates.

6/20: Lender assures us we’re all set to close on 6/23.

6/23: Escrow demands loan docs. Lender doesn’t send them.
I’m asked to sign an extension to 6/25. I do.

6/24: Radio silence. My agent has no idea what’s going on.

Today (6/25): Lender suddenly “discovers” the buyer owes the IRS.
Deal is probably dead. 


And here's the kicker:
The buyer is a professional athlete.
You’d think they’d have a financial team in place — or at least someone competent enough to flag a tax debt before the day of closing. But nope. Just another trainwreck I get to pay for.

Meanwhile, I’ve already moved out.
Utilities are off.
Mortgage is unpaid (because we were supposed to close).
And I’ve been living hotel with my daughters because all my furniture was sold and have no family or friends living in the area. 

I leave the country in 5 days. I have no backup plan.

And this isn’t the first time. A previous buyer lied about their income (1099 vs W-2) that blew up during final underwriting too. Same last-minute collapse. Same chaos. Same costs, all on me.

I’ve eaten thousands in expenses, weeks of lost time on the market, and more stress than I can put into words.
I’m not in the business of collecting earnest money from flaky buyers.

So I’m begging for help:
How do I protect myself from this kind of disaster in the future?

RealEstate,pay off debt,Can I afford this $295k triplex,"I’m a 24-year-old single male, no kids. I make about $5,800/month (pre-tax), have no debt, and my car is paid off. I’m in sales, $5,800 is a 2 year average. 

Current assets:
	•	$5,000 cash
	•	$35,000 in a Roth IRA
	•	$4,500 in an HSA
	•	$5k–10k in 401ks

Currently I pay:
- $150 in car insurance 
- $50 phone bill 
- $300 monthly towards the hsa 
- 5% monthly toward a 401k 
- $130 for health, dental, and vision 

I figure if needed I can pause contributions towards hsa and 401k to save up again. 

I’m looking at purchasing a $295,000 triplex. I would live in one unit and rent out the other two. Rent on the other two units would bring in $1,050 and $800 monthly.

I’d be putting 3.5% down. I just offered $295k, asking price, and seller paying closing costs. I’m estimating I’d come out of pocket about 14k to cover an inspection, downpayment, any fees on my end. So I would have to pull from my Roth, which I can do without penalty (from contributions). 

I’m trying to figure out if this is realistically affordable for me and what I should be considering (e.g., reserves, maintenance, worst-case scenarios, etc.). Would love input on whether this seems like a smart move financially or if I’m jumping in too early.

RealEstate,credit card debt,German Credit Card offers/scammers?,"Hey Guys, I’m a banker and finance nerd from Germany. I need some help so I can understand a new offer in the German market better which has been on the rise. In the last 2-3 years some quite professional looking „consulting“ shops have opened their business in Germany where they are advising German real estate investors to pay them 20k$ for them to setup a company, legal and tax structure in the USA to take advantage of „better“ 0% interest credit cards. Now these seem to only have limited time of 0% and a set fee (2-5%) to transfer these huge debts from credit cards to credit card so you don’t have to pay a hefty 22%. 

This seems „logical“ because if you „only“ pay 2-5% once a year to transfer the debt that’s just like a normal loan but with less „control“/decision making of the bank. Some people argued to me people use it when they used up their main financial capacities from local banks (which actually happens here in Germany because the bank is only allowed to loan you x-amount to not overgo certain risk criteria) other posts about how this is so great and they just get more and more of these credit cards to fuel multiple large projects at once. 

I need the perspective of you guys if it’s a normal strategy in the US and how there can be even so many credit cards offering conditions like that

RealEstate,credit card debt,Buying an apartment with my(27f) partner (31m) who has no savings. Advice?,"Hi everyone, I’m looking for some advice or outside perspective on a financial decision my partner and I are facing.

We’re planning to buy an apartment together.  I have a good amount of savings since I’ve been saving for YEARS for a home and can fully cover the down payment, but my partner doesn’t have any savings at the moment. He went through a rough patch financially after losing his job a while ago and had to focus on paying off credit card debt. He does have a nice paying job now.

The thing is, I currently have enough savings to cover the full down payment, but my partner doesn’t. He’s considering taking out a loan to cover his part, while I would pay mine upfront in cash.

I’m feeling conflicted. On one hand, I want us both to feel equally invested and responsible. But if he takes out a loan, he’ll be under a lot more financial pressure, especially since we’ll both still have the mortgage payments on top of that.

The other option we’ve discussed is that I could cover the entire down payment for now, and he would gradually pay me back over time. But I’m hesitant to go that route because it puts more risk on me, especially if things don’t go as planned.

I’ve also considered having a legal agreement drafted to protect my investment in case anything happens, but it still feels like a big emotional and financial leap.

The title would have to be under his name only because the bank requires at least 2 years at the current job to include someone, and I only have 1 so far. So it makes everything more conflicting for me, because I’d be putting in about 80% of my total savings into a house that wouldn’t even be under my name at the beginning.

He says that it would also be a big responsibility for him, since if anything goes wrong, it’s technically on him because the property is in his name. And he’s also said that it shouldn’t matter anyway because we’re going to get married — so in his view, it’ll be our home regardless of whose name is on the title.

But from my perspective, I’m still taking a huge risk — because I’d be tying up almost everything I’ve saved into something I wouldn’t legally own (at least initially). So yeah… it’s definitely not a simple situation.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? Would you split it unevenly with a payback agreement? Or is it better for both parties to come in equally, even if it means loans? Any advice would be appreciated.

When I try to explain my concerns, he says I’m making it all about money and that I don’t trust him, and that if roles were reversed he wouldn’t care I don’t have any money which makes it harder to have a productive conversation. I’m just trying to figure out a solution that feels fair and safe for both of us.",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1lfuxb4/buying_an_apartment_with_my27f_partner_31m_who/,1750393289.0,Comfortable_Fox_6201,1lfuxb4,advice_seeking

Based on how my life is going, this could very well be my forever home with no kids. I am in my mid 30s.

I am debating if I should put down the minimum 20% down payment and deal with the higher monthly payment. This would give me about 50-70k liquid for emergencies and spending, and I would chip at this reserve to help cover bills and the mortgage. Then wait for what I hope is an inevitable drop in interest rates and capitalize on a refi. Also, my financial situation should only improve as I advance in my career so I assume my monthly take home income will get better over time.

OR

Put as much on a down payment as possible but have less liquid cash. I would still have a little bit for emergencies but would have little left over for spending.

I am leaning towards option 1 to have a high liquid reserve because I imagine interest rates will drop lower than they are now at some point before my reserves run dry. And having more liquid cash wouldn't give me the ""living paycheck to paycheck"" feeling (of course extreme budgeting will still be practiced).

RealEstate,credit card debt,Parents want to transfer house ownership to me to refinance under my name,"Sorry, long post ahead 

Edit: Sorry, is a lot to take in, but I'll try make it as imformative and simple to understand as possible

We're Asian American immigrants in the US living in Kansas near Kansas City 

My parents lost a stable job in 2018 so I been living with them to help them with bills and mortgages. I'm 37M and they're both 65

We refinance the first time with Rocket Mortgage and things were decent the past 6 years. 

But now my dad wants to retire soon and was looking to sell the house, and we were ready to pull the trigger but didn't in the last second because the house been with us for 25 years and got a little sentimental. What didn't help also is Mom failed to inform us that she miss a mortgage payment during winter time which killed their credit score to around 600's

Also they have 120,000$ in  credit card debt 

The house is value at 357000 with 167000 mortgage left 

Like is not a bad house at all, it just need some fix her upper, also the best thing about it is on a nice school district.

Me and my dad works in the restaurant industry, I make around 50,000 a year I think he makes around 30-40,000 In hourly 

My parents think the best way to keep the house in the family and to get rid of their credit card debt is to transfer the house title/ownership to me so they can refinance under my name. 

I told them I would do it but now I'm having doubts after doing more research and talking to people. Not to mention I have no idea how any of this works. I feel like a piece of shit because they cancelled a real estate agent meeting and a down payment on an townhouse, that part is on me. 

I know my Dad is not trying to hurt me on purpose but I'm having doubts is going to work out easily the way he says is going to work out.

The biggest problem is their credit card debt, is holding up income the most 

So what's the best way forward here?

My sister thinks we should sell

Can they still refinance and after a late payment?

If they transfer the house to me would I be screwed for life?

I want a life of my own but also don't want to see us lose the family home 

Or should we just cut our losses and sell?

My heart tells me I should help and it'll work out, but my guts and everyone I know is telling me that's a bad idea and time to sell, move out and eventually have a life of my own

RealEstate,drowning in debt,How does anyone do this?,"First off, hoping I used the right flair, please feel free to correct me and I will adjust.

Second, here is my story...
I am a first time homebuyer living in Kansas City, Kansas. The rental market here is competitive and it is beginning to look more cost effective to own a home, at least in the sense that I would also be making an investment for myself potentially (I do not want to get into the argument of how expensive it is to maintain a home. I have enough family members telling me that).

Anyway, I have multiple problems/questions.
EDIT: I'm not looking for actual consulting necessarily. I more so would like to know which direction i go to find the answers I'm looking for. Thank you to all who are pointing me in the right direction.
 
1. I don't really have any savings. I have student loan debt I am drowning in and if I wait until I can pay that off I won't own a home before I retire (this economy sucks, man).
EDIT: for clarity I am not looking at buying a home tomorrow. I am working on saving right now, but the amount I can pay in closing costs and down payments will still be low and there will be a debt to income ratio issue when qualifying for assistance for a while. I really am trying guys. 

2. I absolutely do not understand the buying process. What is an escrow? Why do I pay it? Are there benefits to an HOA? It doesn't sound like it. Why can't I have the property appraised before I make an offer? I can't make an offer if I don't know how much financial help I qualify for and I only qualify for whatever the property is appraised for! What? Do I get an agent first or a lendor first? If I get an agent first and then find out from the lendor I dont qualify for financial help, then what? Did I waste the agent's time? Do I pay them and thank them for their time or just say sayanora? Can an inspector tell me if a house is worth buying? When do I involve the I spector? Does the lendor have to pick the inspector?

3. I have my eyes on a cute and decently sized property. I would eventually like to homestead. The property is being sold as is and is twice the price I currently qualify for, but the AS/IS part is deterring a lot of buyers. For starters the main house has mold, the guest house likely needs dozed, and the 2 barns are in need of maintenance. I briefly spoke to one agent to get some context and they believe the price of the property will continue to drop (potentially closer to what I qualify for) and I'm delusional and think I can fix her. Am I actually delusional? Is this an idea I should even be entertaining? I'm afraid that the neighbor of this rural property may sweep in before I can make an offer and just buy the land to flatten it and add to their property and it's too pretty of a property. My heart would be crushed. Is there anything I can do to negotiate the house down quicker? How much lower can the value get? Will it ever get low enough for me to afford anyway?

Thanks to anyone who actually reads any of this and is willing to provide wisdom.

RealEstate,drowning in debt,How do I get rid of my house? ,"I’m needing help on figuring out what to do with our old house. Our house is very old and has some very costly repairs that are needing done. My fiance bought it at a very young age and due to some serious life things, he was unable to keep up with certain areas. Now we’re in a situation where if we were to fix everything (small crack in foundation, floors, window frames, asbestos siding that’s chipping, redoing the addition’s exterior wall that was poorly constructed, new AC, etc.), we’d be looking at close to 100,000 dollars in repairs. We’re getting married and recently found out we’re expecting. It seems nearly impossible to pay for all these repairs, pay down current debts, and save anything at all. I feel like I’m drowning in this house that in order to sell would take so much money or time we don’t have. It’s also small so with having a baby, there’s a time limit on how long we could sustain a family here. 

We get those flyers of “we want to buy your house as is for cash” and I know those tend to be a scheme. However I don’t know what else to do. I know nothing about real estate. Is there anything we CAN do to sell this without making all of the repairs? Or are we stuck here forever ? 🥲

EDIT: wanted to add that when my fiance bought it, he bought it from a lady selling it for her grandma who had to be moved to a home. Necessary repairs hadn’t all been done when he moved in and due to his age, he didn’t think to ask certain questions. At the time he had a young son and just needed a home for a lower price.

RealEstate,debt snowball,Home Equity Loan or HELOC,"I am in the market for a home equity loan for debt consolidation in the amount of $30,000. I was offered a product with a 7.5% interest rate, but more than $2,000 in closing costs. This seems unreasonably high for such a low loan amount.

It also appears that property tax and home insurance are bundled into the payments, for some reason, which surprised me. I currently own the property outright.

RealEstate,debt snowball,Advice on investment properties ,"Hello,

I am a 29 years old, married with a 2 year old and one on the way. I make about 270k per year before taxes. I have a car loan 16k, and student loans 25k which we are working on paying off.

I have 2 investment properties currently rented (one profitable by around $1500 per month, the other I am losing $300 a month on), and another house which I reside in all are mortgaged with a little over 20% equity in each.

Investment house 1: worth 700k, 300k mortgage remaining profitable by $1500 per month, 2.75% interest rate. (I have a 200k HELOC available to me that is currently not being used and is paid off).

Investment 2: worth 320, 253k mortgage remaining, losing $300 per month. 5.5% interest rate.

My house which we live in is worth around 850-900k, 688k mortgage remaining with 3.8% interest rate.

My question is what do I do to take most advantage of my situation? Should I sell the house that is not profitable and use the debt snowball to put that money towards the house that is until I eventually pay it off? Then pay off the house that I am living in over time? 

I feel like I can leverage my situation better, thanks!",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1hzp7px/advice_on_investment_properties/,1736696127.0,kayzab,1hzp7px,advice_seeking
RealEstate,student loan help,How does anyone afford a home these days 😭,"I’m completely heartbroken, and my ambition feels drained.

My husband and I both have good jobs, with a combined income of $110K per year, and we’re expecting raises by the end of the year. We’re also actively searching for new jobs to further increase our pay.

We currently live in the Seattle region, which we love, but the cost of living has become overwhelming. Our rent is $1,600 per month, not including utilities, and we have fixed expenses like student loans and phone bills totaling $1,300. Altogether, we’re paying around $3,000 per month. We’ve managed to save up $15K, but it feels like it’s not enough.

We recently spoke with a lender and got pre-approved for a $400K FHA loan. They offered us two options: an FHA loan with down payment assistance (DPA) at a monthly payment of $3,700 or without DPA at $3,400. However, after looking at all the fees and costs involved, it hit us that we won’t be able to afford the real estate fees, closing costs, and down payment for a few more years.

For example, if we bought a $400K home and the realtor charged a 3% fee, we’d owe $12K, and the down payment and closing costs would be another $12K each. Altogether, we’d be looking at around $36K just to cover those upfront costs as first-time homebuyers. We have looked into USDA loans along with just purchasing land but again we face those fees. We do not have enough anywhere to cover those fees. We have looked into other DPA programs but they are second leans/loans. We are struggling to find “free help”. We just want a home. 

We could lower our price range, but even then, to meet the FHA guidelines and stay within what we can afford, we’d have to reduce our budget to no more than $300K—and likely move somewhere with a lower cost of living.

This whole situation is just so frustrating. I just need someone to tell me I’m not alone in feeling angry and sad about not being able to buy a home. We want to start a family, but even that feels out of reach because of the cost of living. It’s overwhelming.

RealEstate,student loan help,Need help getting a loan approval as a 1099 employee,"I am beyond frustrated. We have gone through several local lenders over the last 2 years and they all say our income is too inconsistent to qualify for a loan. Here is our situation:

Husband and I work 1099 for Company A in the summer (May-October) where we make commission only so every month varies slightly in pay. October-April my husband works W2 contract work for Company B but does maybe 4-5 separate contracts during that period. Here are our average earnings:

1099
Me: $30,000
Monthly: May-October: $1000-$4000
                 Nov-April: $600ish
Husband: $35,000
Monthly: May-October: $2000-$5000
                Nov-Apr: $0

W2:
Husband: October-April: $70,000

Credit Scores:
Me: 737
Husband: 720

The only debt we have is my student loans ($76k with a $600 monthly payment) and I’ve never missed a payment. We have never owned a home before, never declared bankruptcy. 

We have consistent annual earnings of around $102,000 which can easily be proven through our paystub records, W2 and 1099 documents, and tax returns. 

I am so beyond frustrated how loan officers still come back and say our income/employment is too inconsistent. Yes, our monthly income varies quite dramatically, but we are employed every month out of the year and make a decent amount of money. We just want to own our own home and I feel so upset. Do people who work contracting jobs or 1099s just never buy homes? There’s no way we are the only ones with work like this. 

Please advise. Not sure what to do from here.

RealEstate,student loan help,Should we engage a realtor here?,"My 23-year-old son and his girlfriend have been renting a house for about a year or so now.  The owner is quite elderly and the property is managed by his neice.  On the whole they've been pretty happy with their place and their interactions with the family.  The house is situated well for them.  His girlfriend's mother lives right next door, and she is a huge help in caring for his girlfriend's four year old son.  

There has been talk for awhile now about possibly giving them the option to buy the house, but as my son is paying off student loans AND taking night classes right now, he was hesitant to have too serious a conversation about that.  However, we've recently learned that the elderly owner has passed away, and the family now wants to sell the house.  They've offered to sell it for about $100,000, which is about $30K less than the 'Zestimate' provided by Zillow and seems pretty fair. 

We are discussing the financing now, but they feel very pressured to make a quick decision, especially given that, if the decision is 'no', they will most likely need to move.  I feel uncomfortable advising them on my own, and wondered if we should contact our realtor to step in and help them through this.  Would that be wise, or just add needless costs to the situation?

RealEstate,student loan help,Closing costs super high?,"I am planning to buy a student rental about 4 hours away in a college town for a maximum of $140,000. $112,000 loan 30 years, with 20% down. I just got my pre-approval letter today but my question is..... Why are the closing costs $14,000 for a 30-year fixed mortgage with 20% down? 

The mortgage person at the bank just kept talking about points and that he tried to get me a 7/1 ARM... But that there would still be a $2,500 fee and it ended up being about the same $14,000 that the 30 year fixed would require in closing costs. 

It was my understanding that closing costs are anywhere from 2 to 5% of the loan amount? The mortgage person told me that apparently two years ago Fannie and Freddy jacked up their closing cost on investment properties? Is this true or am I just getting the work around because the mortgage person doesn't want to say that his bank just charges crazy high closing costs? It's basically 10% of the purchase price which seems crazy to me. Is the $14,000 strictly just fees to close or does that include a year's worth of property taxes to be put in escrow at closing?

The rate is going to be in the high 6% and almost 7%. Should I just go to a mortgage broker so they can find me a bank that doesn't have basically 10% of the purchase price worth of closing costs? Is this just the new reality in 2025?

RealEstate,student loan help,"Selling house after purchase OK'd by LO, disallowed by underwriter","We're moving from Kansas to Ohio, expected to close Tuesday but got word from underwriting the present house must be under contract for it to be clear from our liabilities in final DTI calculation (change of ~17%, pushes us above 50%).

LO #1 said it's permissible to put the house on the market *after* and preapproval was based upon this information. LO #2 is speaking direct with UW now and UW wants the house *under contract* for it to not be counted against us.

Who's right in this situation? Did LO #1 misrepresent what's offered by their mortgage servicer (Navy Federal)? Is UW just following HUD guidelines? What happens if the old house goes under contract but the buyer backs out after we close on the new house? It appears to me to be the same risk. 

I can't see the logic in taking out a bridge loan: we have adequate cash to close with 20% down payment + another 50k cushion. Old house is expected to go on the market by mid-August.

---

**Edit:** took a substantial impairment in 2024 for business, which combined with 1% Fannie Mae student loans pushed the DTI above 50%. Going with a 0.5% Freddie Mac lender straightened out our numbers such that we can carry the current house for a month or two after closing on the new residence. If last year is greater than prior year, those are averaged. If last year is significantly less than prior, (> 20%) then last year is used exclusively. 

Why Navy Federal let everything go to underwriting is stupefying. Even the processor was clueless on all liabilities making up DTI calculation.

RealEstate,student loan help,Help! 1M Home First Time Homebuyers,"I can't tell if I'm getting cold feet because this isn't the right home for us or if this is normal especially given the enormity of the purchase. My husband and I are first time homebuyers, we make 500k combined income, and we are looking to buy a 970k home in Lincoln Park / Old Town in Chicago, IL. Our budget unfortunately does not cover too much in this area (SFHs are generally 1.5M+) so while we'd ideally buy a SFH, we love living in the city and Lincoln Park is our dream neighborhood and we're not ready to move to the burbs quite yet, so we've settled on this townhome / condo. 

Some other facts:

- We have a baby on the way (I also can't help but wonder if becoming first time parents is contributing to the nerves I feel with buying a home). 
- Ideally we'd live in this home for 5-7 years until our third baby is on the way, then we'd move further out of the city to a bigger space.
- The townhome is 3 bedrooms 3 bath. We both work partially from home so setting up two office spaces + planning to grow into this space for two kids / potentially three + 2 dogs might be a bit of a tight squeeze.
- The townhome is 40 years old. We'd love to buy a newer place but genuinely this one is so cute and lovely. The bathrooms were recently re-done, we did our inspection and there's only some minor issues (like the windows are a bit old and will need to be replaced at some point). It's part of a larger complex of townhomes that encircle a small private outdoor common space. HOA is 600$ a month. It's 2300 sq feet. There's 3 floors. There's a garage, a driveway, and a little patio out back. I was obsessed when I first saw it (I'm only just getting cold feet recently lol). It's a 10-15 min walk to multiple parks and the lake. It's a 10 min drive to work. 
- We are putting 20% down. Our payments will be around 7k a month + however much in maintenance and renovations. This /feels/ like a lot of money to pay, even though I know we can afford it, my mind keeps jumping to - what if one of us loses our jobs? A baby is super expensive too, plus daycare, what if we're house poor? 
- We also have 130k in student loans that we are paying off.
- Not counting the 130k in student loans, or the down payment, we have 300k in various brokerages and HYSAs.

RealEstate,ready to buy a house,Manipulative Buyers Got Greedy and Lost a Great House,"We listed our house last November with the same realtor we used to buy the house with. She was great as a buyers agent, very aggressive when finding a house for us. Not so great when she was our seller agent. We listed at the low end of her appraisal range since it was November and the beginning of the slow season. Our house was in superb condition, well kept and just a well built custom home with top of the line construction materials. First weekend on the market we received an offer from a buyer (who did a second showing without making an appointment or letting us know), and we responded with a counter offer. 2 days later we hadn't heard anything so we texted our realtor to find out what was going on. No response. 6 hours later we text again......no response. 8pm my wife texts and asks if everything is ok? 9pm the realtor responds with ""Oh, they didn't want to take the counter offer"". No reasons given why they didn't want to accept the counter offer, and her response was short, almost like we were bothering her even asking. 5 days later she calls and says the same buyers have a counter to our counter, to which we verbally agree to the terms.

We get the contract and as I'm reading through it, while docusigning, I come to the inspection/repair addendum where it states that we will pay up to $2k in repairs on the septic and up to $2k in repairs on the well. This wasn't verbally agreed upon, so this irritated us but we signed it anyways knowing that the well and septic were in top shape. The inspections are completed, and 2 days after the inspection, my ring camera alerts me to someone being in the driveway. I look and see a truck and trailer had backed into my driveway and 3 guys get out and put a ladder on my roof and start climbing on the roof. Again, no appointment was made so I immediately thought squatters (since the property was vacant). I called my realtor (who surprisingly answered) before calling the police just to be sure it wasn't the buyer sending someone for another inspection. The realtor says she wasn't aware of anyone coming on the property so she called their realtor. Their realtor took hours to get back to her, but in the meantime those guys ended up leaving so I never contacted the police. Their realtor said the buyer sent someone out to do repair estimates. Again, we let it go because we just wanted to sell the house. 2 days later we get a repair request and the inspection report. I looked at the inspection report, no major issues just a bunch of little things, and these buyers wanted $40k in repairs, with $25k for a new roof....that wasn't even called out in the inspection! It's an architectural shingle roof (30 year life) on a 20 year old house. I had a roofer come out and look at it and said at least 10 more years life left, and a current replacement would be about $12.5k. Half what their friends quoted.

Turns out, these ""contractors"" were friends of theirs (as confirmed on FB) and said the roof had 2 years left at most. They also over priced all of the small items (nothing major found) listed in the repair request. I'm all about negotiating, I know as a buyer you want the best deal and as a seller you want the most money, but when someone tries to manipulate negotiations to get more money out of the other party, that is bad business. We told our our realtor we will do zero repairs and credit them $0. Their realtor immediately asks if we would at least give them $5k to which we gave them the one finger salute. They terminated the contract, as expected, and we took the house off the market and fired our realtor. We were going to relist in the spring when the market picked back up.

Fast Forward to March, an old neighbor who moved out of state a few years ago contacted me and asked if we were still planning to sell. We said we were just getting ready to list again in April, and they asked if we'd like to sell it to them without realtor involvement. We said sure, and came to an agreement on a price. He used an RE lawyer who also was a title company for the paperwork, and had all of his inspections completed again. I had repaired most of the little things found in the last inspection, and the new inspections didn't uncover anything new. We just closed on Friday, I made more money than if I would have sold to the manipulative buyers, and everything went smoothly with no shady business. Sometimes when one door closes, a bigger door opens.

Edit: I forgot to mention that both sets of the buyers parents were very involved with the sale. All 4 parents were at the second showing, and all 4 were at the inspections, apparently following the home inspector around questioning a lot of things. Me personally, I wouldn't want anyone following my inspector around because that would distract him from doing his job. The inspection report even included pics of 'findings' that had one of the parents in the pics LOL! I think the buyers were getting some bad negotiating advice from 1 or more of their parents. Not to say that they shouldn't be looking out for their kids, but their advice could be what cost their kids a great deal on a very nice house.",3084,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1kjskaa/manipulative_buyers_got_greedy_and_lost_a_great/,1746937350.0,SilverSliverShiver,1kjskaa,advice_seeking

As a buyer of the 2nd home, what commissions would I normally be responsible for?

I am asking because the house is a bit above our expected budget. I would have to offer about 10% off asking to get in on budget ... and I am trying to avoid any surprises.

RealEstate,ready to buy a house,Should I buy a condo closer to the city or a house far away with a USDA loan?,"I make about $60k a year, single with no kids, and I live in the DFW area. I’ve been seriously wanting to buy a home, but I’ve hit a bit of a dilemma.

I can likely get approved for around $180k, which doesn’t give me many good options in today’s market. Everything even remotely decent in that price range is either over an hour away from the city, in need of major renovations (which I can’t afford to do), or just not livable.

So here’s where I’m stuck:
	•	I could buy a nicer 3-bedroom house in a USDA-eligible area. The price would be right, the house would be move-in ready, but I’d be looking at a 1-hour commute. Plus, with USDA loans, I know you can’t rent the property out until it’s fully paid off—so if it turns out not to be my “forever home,” I’d have to sell.
	•	Or I could go for a condo in the $120-160k range using an FHA loan. These are renovated, in better locations (30–40 min commute), and closer to everything I need. I’d lose out on that “house with a yard” dream for now, but it feels more practical for this stage of my life.

My original goal was to buy a house, but now I’m wondering: is it smarter to buy a condo now, sit on it for a few years, and then upgrade later? Or do I just bite the bullet, get the USDA home, and live with the long commute for a while?

Curious to hear from people who’ve been in similar situations. What would you do in my shoes?",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1m2aaic/should_i_buy_a_condo_closer_to_the_city_or_a/,1752765463.0,QuietCareful,1m2aaic,advice_seeking
RealEstate,ready to buy a house,College Student buying a house to rent,"I’m currently a junior in the nursing program at my local college, and I’m considering buying a house to rent out. I have a girlfriend, and we’re planning to get married after I finish nursing school. Ideally, I’d like to have a place ready for us to move into before we tie the knot. However, as a student working part-time, I’m aware that funds are tight, and I understand there are significant expenses involved in purchasing a house, even beyond the initial down payment.

Since I wouldn’t be living in the house for at least two more years while I finish school, I’m trying to decide if this would be a wise investment or if it would be better to wait until after graduation to purchase a home.

Additionally, my girlfriend is content staying in this small town, which I’m fine with as well. I know some people may have concerns about being settled in one place long-term, but it’s not an issue for us.

Would buying now make sense financially, or would it be more prudent to wait?

No home by choice.

Now as I get older the old school part of me says, ""I must own a home!""

The issue is the prices arent appealing. Every rent/buy calculator has renting as the betteer financial option.

I use 4.25% home appreciation and 6.5% stock market appreciation.

Houses we look at are 600-650k/ 15yr mtg, 25% down.

Rent is 3500/mo or less.

RealEstate,buy vs rent,"Young doctor, can't decide between renting and buying","Posting for a friend! 

I'm in my late 20s/early 30s and graduated from medical residency one month ago. Starting this Fall, I will be earning over $300,000 gross. I have little to no savings or investments currently because I have been a student/resident for my entire life until now.

I know about the general, conservative advice about buying, including waiting until I have 20% downpayment (which I don't have) and be ready to stay in the same place for 5-10 years minimum (which is not true for me as I am possibly moving within 4-5 years).

I'm happy to follow such advice and hold off from real estate for now. But I have two main differences from the general population that heavily make me want to consider buying:

As a physician, I have access to physician mortgage loans, which typically means little-to-no downpayment required and no PMI -- with a catch of maybe up to 0.25% higher interest rate compared to a conventional loan.

I live in a very hot housing market per Realtor.com and Wall Street Journal, among others. According to Google/Zillow/Redfin, year-over-year: median sale price up \~10% and average home value up \~15%. Some sources show up to a 20% increase but it's almost unbelievable. I won't name my location to avoid doxxing myself (the medical community is small here), but there is reason to believe this trend will continue over the next years.

Now i'm very confused and would greatly appreciate advice. I'm currently renting for $2,000 a month. I've tried playing with rent-vs-buy calculators online which usually recommend buying once I plug in values from #2, but I wonder if I am being foolish making such a big financial decision even when I am not financially stable yet (according to conventional standards) just because the market is hot and all my colleagues are buying right now.

Edit: 
I have no medical school debt. I have a car with <20,000 dollars left to pay off. 
Median house price here is $150-200k. I’d assume mortgage will be around $2000-2500 per month.

RealEstate,buy vs rent,Rent vs Buy with Variable Rate Mortgage,"Am I crazy?

28, engaged, getting married 2026. Total income $375k a year, maxing 401ks and low 6 figures in taxable investment account. 200k+ in retirement. 15k student loan debt at 3.5%.

Our rent right now is $4,500 a month for a 1 bedroom. We signed in 2024. Lease ends May 2026. Expecting our rent to jump to $5,200 for a 1 bedroom in NJ.

Plan is to live in NJ/NYC city life for another 3 to 5 years. Then move to the suburbs.

Right now, I think we can get a 2 bedroom 2 bathroom for $800k to $850k in our area.

With multiple factors, increased SALT deduction with the big beautiful bill, Powell’s term ending in January, our executive branch repeatedly saying rates need to go down, higher supply of homes on the market. I think the next 9 months might be a great time to buy.

Is a variable rate mortgage (3years fixed then adjusted every 6months) crazy? People around me keep saying it’s risky. The variable rate I see is 5.75% vs 6.5% for a 30 year fixed.

Is buying to only live in a 800k apartment in NJ for 3 to 5 years crazy? I would expect to rent out the unit after we move.

RealEstate,buy vs rent,Rent vs Buy in a Declining Housing Market... A Question!,"Someone check to see if my logic/maths is correct.  
  
The common logic used to be to always buy instead of rent in order to build equity. But if housing prices are going down (and they are in my area), the idea of buying starts to seem less lucrative given that the pace at which you pay off your mortgage might not keep pace with how quickly value of house is dropping, resulting in a loss (not to mention loss from down payment, closing fees, etc).

So, say you can rent a house that would sell at 600k for 3k.

Say a mortgage of an equivalent house is 3500 after 10% down etc. So that's initial 60k with say another 20k in closing costs, etc. So you've got a mortgage of roughly 550 on a house worth 600. If house value drops to 550 after a year, youve barely scratched your mortgage and youve lost equity you've built up via down payment. So a total loss of roughly 80k if you decide to sell after year one (60 down and 20 closing costs).

Whereas if you rented, you've lost 36k.

Your only hope as a home owner in that situation is to cross your fingers and hope market bounces back, because otherwise you're stuck in a home you can't move out of unless you want to eat that loss.

In other words, though the customary idea is to buy instead of renting (because renting is seen as a pure loss), that logic only seems to hold in an economy where house values are projected to increase. In a downturn, it's not necessarily better to buy because you don't know where the bottom is, so if renting is the ""smaller loss"" then it makes sense to rent, no?

Is this thinking correct, or am I missing something?",0,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1ggdcha/rent_vs_buy_in_a_declining_housing_market_a/,1730377865.0,Own-Inspection3104,1ggdcha,advice_seeking
RealEstate,buy vs rent,"Rent vs Buy in Cambridge, MA, in 2025?","We're a couple in our late 30s considering buying a 2-bedroom unit in Cambridge, MA. We’re looking at condos or mutli-family units so we share expenses with exterior upkeep.

Our situation:

* Combined income: \~$200K
* Down payment & closing costs: up to $200K
* Estimated interest rate: \~6.6%
* Estimated total monthly housing costs (mortgage + taxes + condo fees + insurance): \~$5,000
* That’s about 30% of our gross monthly income
* No kids, no car, no debt

We currently pay $2,800/month in rent with utilities (we lucked out with our current place, but rent will change in two-three years). Most comparable rentals in the area are around $3,800/month now and rising. I'm concerned if we could no longer stay at our current place, we'd have to pay sky-high rents in the neighborhood.

We’re relatively stable in our jobs, and I’m comfortable with some light home maintenance. I’ve always wanted to own a home, but I’d love to hear from others about whether this is a financially sound decision.

RealEstate,buy vs rent,Houston Rent vs. Buy,"Hi! 37/F currently renting a 1bd/1ba in an amazing, walkable area in Houston right near Memorial Park. I’m a huge outdoor person and love to run/walk, so it’s perfect for me. My monthly rent is $2200 (inclusive of apartment fees) and my energy bill is about $80/mo. Renter’s insurance is $20, bringing my housing, insurance and energy to $2300 per month.

I am looking at $500k-$600k townhomes in the area (which are the cheapest ones I this neighborhood). If the home was 100% paid off, I’d still need to pay up to $6k annually in homeowners  insurance (this is the figure other owners in the area tell me they have been paying and consistent with my research) and 2.3% in property taxes, up to almost $14,000 per year. Energy would average $300/mo per my research. This would mean that my PAID OFF housing and energy is ~$1,900 per month. 

Owning the home free and clear would save me $400 per month versus renting, which would undoubtedly go to home maintenance costs which I’ve been told I need to budget 2% of the home cost. 

So.. how is it possible that buying a home with that money would be more financially responsible than renting, assuming that I had the $500-600k in my bank account to be invested and average 6-8% (conservatively) per year?

RealEstate,afford a house,AITA? Sellers refused to negotiate and we walked (OR),"Made an offer for a 950k home that had sat on the market for 3 weeks, with many comps sitting for 2-3 months. We went to both open houses and there was near zero traffic. No offers. 

Offered 930k with 10k seller credits because the seller kept appliances. They countered and we landed at 940k/10k credits.

Inspections came back with some minor mold, minor pests in the crawl space, but two majors: roof required 3-5k of repairs to certify for ""2-5 years"" and HVAC was near end of life, and hadn't been serviced in over a decade. We found out through this process that the owner had rented the home and it was basically an investment property.

This was close to our dream home. Perfect schools, amazing setup. First of 15 homes my wife and I both loved. 

We came back and offered 10k more in seller credits, and 10k off the sale price. Essentially, asked for them to cover half the roof and HVAC replacement required in the next few years. 

Seller got angry. Didn't counter, just asked to terminate. Our relator said it was one of the angriest calls she'd gotten and the seller basically said we're assholes that couldn't afford the house. 

Listed the house the next day for 930k. Multiple comps dropped to 900-920k. Now off market, looks like they're listing for rent.

- main homeowner has >51 % ownership
- main homeowner is the one living in it and pays no rent and assumes all property costs
- main homeowner pays 1%/year to other owners as an incentive to invest

My background is in construction and at first glance, the house we saw is a real beauty. It’s 25 years old and it’s a style called an “Atrium Ranch.”

It has a wall of two-story windows on the back of the house overlooking the large back yard. At first glance, it’s stunning. 

But as I examined the house, I discovered that the J-channel (on the vinyl siding) had been installed incorrectly causing multiple water leaks on multiple windows. The water damage had been painted over but it was still evident. 

The kitchen had suffered a massive roach infestation and even the electrical outlets had remnants of the creepy critters. Some of the cabinets had rotted bottoms. The kitchen was in poor shape. 

The house had multiple problems and needed lots of work. And I am not talking about updating but just making it livable.

RealEstate,first home,What surprised you the most after buying your first home?,"Hey everyone, I’m closing on my first house in upstate New York in a couple weeks. It’s been a lot 🥹

We did the inspection and the local plumber flagged a shut-off valve that was already starting to corrode. Not a HUGE deal but it made me realize how quickly small stuff can turn into pricey repairs I wasn’t budgeting for.

I’ve been looking into home warranty options just in case more issues pop up after I move in. I checked out Liberty Home Guard, Cinch, and American Home Shield. AHS has the big name since they’ve been around forever, but I’m kind of leaning toward Liberty Home Guard because I read good stuff about them here and their reviews are better in general.

Other than that, I’m just trying to prepare myself for the little surprises no one talks about. For those of you who’ve been through it, what surprised you the most after moving in? Any random costs, annoying issues, or stuff you wish someone warned you about?

Would really appreciate any advice before I dive in for real.",119,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1luzmws/what_surprised_you_the_most_after_buying_your/,1752007083.0,WearyTouch9620,1luzmws,advice_seeking
RealEstate,first home,First time home buyer. Extremely frustrated.,"I've been looking for a house since February. Signed with a Redfin agent because she showed me a few houses and seemed trustworthy. Fast forward to May, I've put in an offer on a house and it was accepted. Cool. Agent decides to quit Redfin without any warning. Find out because the new agent calls to introduce himself. Fine. Whatever. Contract I sign says sellers have 30 day possession after closing. Cool. We're literally 4 days before closing and my lawyer calls me that sellers might terminate contract because the house they're buying fell through. Cool, except there was no contingency clause in the original contract. Their attorney sends an amended contract with a new closing date at the end of July but does not elaborate on if the 30 day possession clause would still apply. I don't sign anything/agree to this ""amendment"". Yet Redfin changes the closing date to the end of July in their ""deal room"" app. No one can explain to me why they did this/not answering my emails. Meanwhile, my lawyer is telling me he's trying to get ahold of the seller's attorney to figure out a refund for the appraisal and inspection since they're terminating the contract. I was told I'd have an answer by last Wednesday. Nothing. No official termination, no word on refunding my money. I told Redfin to move forward with the sale and to let the sellers know I'll be taking possession of the property on July 31st.No possession clause. Lawyer says forcing the sale isn't worth it because it might not go in my favor. I'm irate over the lack of communication and this nonchalance about my money/time. Suggestions?

RealEstate,first home,Sellers want us to be financially responsible for their coy fish after closing,"UPDATE! Scroll to the bottom.

We are set to close on a home in three days. There is a Koi pond on the property. The fish are currently hibernating for the wintertime and can’t be removed. We were told the sellers will come back to retrieve their fish “when the weather warms up”. (They are digging a new pond at their new home) In the Purchase Agreement, we added verbiage that we are not responsible for the fish after closing. Yesterday, we receive an addendum from them that takes it even further. If they find any of the fish to be “ill, dead or missing” that we are financially responsible for a minimum of $1000 with NO CAP on damages!!! They also detail that the pond must not have electric turned off to the pump (what if the electricity goes out?), no animals messing with the fish (I’m not manning this thing to keep raccoons out lol) and no additives/chemicals to the water (fine, not touching it). We are long time agents representing ourselves. This is the craziest thing we’ve had come up on a deal! How can we control if the fish died because of age or illness?!!! Agree with me that this is crazy!

UPDATE! We obviously didn’t sign. We instead gave them a Fish Occupancy/Hold Harmless Agreement that said by the act of leaving the fish after we take possession they were agreeing to the terms. No ability to decline signing. Bam. Despite us having verbiage in the PA that we were not responsible and that likely holding up in court, counsel had us button that up even more. The agent was astounded that we felt the need to take it that far. Almost 800 commenters here would probably agree that we most definitely had every right to now feel threatened. Yeah, yeah, in retrospect we should’ve done that in the first place. Guess what we heard this am? The sellers will be removing the fish by possession day! They are paying their specialist to store the fish for them.! Ugh, was that so damn hard?!!! Seriously, why was that not planned out before? I’ve learned a lot from you Redditors about Koi and I appreciate everyone’s support! Never knew what a shitstorm these beautiful creatures would have caused. As for us, we will not be getting into the hobby. No.way.in.hell!

For the all the grammar patrolers: I could not edit “Coy” in the title, bless your hearts. Lol",2955,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1j3ajij/sellers_want_us_to_be_financially_responsible_for/,1741094236.0,Outside-the-Box1976,1j3ajij,
RealEstate,first home,First-Time Seller — Contingent Buyer Still Hasn’t Sold Their Home… WWYD?,"Hi everyone! I’m a first-time seller in Austin and could really use some outside perspective.

Our home went under contract 6 weeks ago with buyers who are relocating here for retirement. Their offer was contingent on the sale of their out-of-state home. Their agent—apparently a big name in their market—assured us the home would sell quickly, so we accepted.

Fast forward 5.5 weeks: we’re supposed to close this Friday (which is also the end of their contingency period), but their house still hasn’t sold. They said for weeks they’d drop the price—and didn’t—then finally lowered it by only $6K. Still no offers. Their agent has been pretty flippant the whole time, repeatedly saying “there are two interested buyers,” but nothing has come of it. No additional price changes. No plan B. They’ve made it clear they’re not open to financing—they’re relying fully on the sale of their current home.

We’ve gone above and beyond to accommodate the minor repairs needed and do our part. Now we’re just trying to decide: do we let the contract terminate and go back on the market, or stick it out and hope they pull it together?

I’ve talked this through with my agent and understand the pros and cons of both options—but I’m really just looking for a gut check from others who’ve been through something similar.

Gratefully,
Stuck

RealEstate,first home,First home purchase nightmare,"Hi, this will be a long nightmare so please bear with me.

We are buying a home for the first time. We were excited and we found a realtor, and she seemed good while touring houses.

When we found a house that we liked and made an offer, we heard back from the realtor saying that there were 11 other people competing for the house and asking us if we wanted to increase the price. So we increased the price by $5000.  The next day we hear back from our realtor saying that the seller will agree to our offer if we give them 10 days after closing before taking the house, we had no issue with this and we naively agreed Since our realtors did not raise any concerns.

We signed the contract on July 1st at night, so our due diligence period of seven days started on that day.  We happen to be immigrants so we did not have the holiday on July 4th in mind when adding the weekend to that we later discovered that we effectively have the 3 days to do the due diligence.

Our agent helped us get an inspection on July 3rd. The inspector reported significant damages, and we needed a contractor to asses cost of repairs. On Friday, July 4th, we received an email from our agent telling us we will begin negotiations next Wednesday, Which is two days after the due diligence period.

Given the short time of the due diligence and the email from the agent we thought that everything was okay and the due diligence period would be for inspections and negotiations could be done after. The contractor was booked on July 7th the last day of due diligence and told us that the repairs cost $40,000.

The next day (one day after due diligence) we received an email from our agent saying that she is sending the seller a due diligence extension request for them to sign (she never mentioned that we needed that previously, and we were surprised.)

On the same day we decided to cancel with the lender that was previously provided by the agent and switch to a new lender since they are offering us a better deal. We were still ready to negotiate Wednesday.

On the same day, my agent sent an email saying the seller won't agree to negotiation  and refusing to sign the due diligence extension that they verbally agreed to on Friday because we switched lenders and basically blaming us for switching lenders without informing her (even though we texted her about it the same morning and she replied).

We told her that she didn't mention the extension was needed before but she told us there is no negotiation and there is nothing she can do at this point since there no extension in writing.

The next day, we decided to call the seller spouse who previously kindly offered us his number during our tour of the house and said we can reach to him about the house any time. The spouse said he is happy to negotiate and he will speak to his wife about it since she is the seller.

The next day, we get a text from our agent saying that seller is not happy that we came to the house and spoke to spouse, we explained to her that it didn't happen and we just called.

We sent a letter to the seller apologizing and requesting a concessions since we gave them 10 days after closing and we couldn't get anything done because of the holiday. The seller verbally agreed to $3K concession but didn't sign it.

A week before closing the seller is requesting to extend the closing by 5 days for $2.5K concession. We refused.

A day before closing the seller unilaterally extended the closing 8 days due to title delays from the IRS. and the 10 days we gave still apply. Effectively meaning 18 days extension in total. Our agent is saying the seller never mentioned IRS before but the lawyers have proof of the IRS delays.

So many issues went wrong with this sale and I'm not sure who is to blame because this is our first purchase and we simply don't know. Is it our agent fault that we agreed to 7 days due diligence on a holiday weekend? is it our fault for giving them 10 days? Is it our fault for switching lenders? Is it our agent fault for not mentioning that she doesn't have a clear title yet and they could extend unilaterally if they have issues before we refused the extension? or is it our fault for not knowing these things? or is it just bad luck?

At this point we are tired of this house it has been a very stressing first home purchase. We can't pull out without losing our earnest money and I'm mostly writing this because I really need to let out and maybe knowing about this nightmare would be helpful to someone in the future.

P.S: Our realtor is being paid about $10K

RealEstate,down payment savings,"I have 100k saved.  Should I use it to put an addition on my current home, or use it as a down payment for a larger home?","To give some context: wife and I are modest middle class people.  We have young kids and we both work.  Currently living in desirable HOA in a 1,500sq ft ranch.  We do like our neighborhood and our plot, but we want more living space.  Looking around the market, anything that we are interested in is $500k+.  We own our home outright, and it is worth roughly $350k.  We have 100k liquid to use as either a down payment for a new (larger) home, or put an addition on our current home.  Wondering if we put that money into our current home, would our $100k investment equate to more buying power after the addition is complete?  Or should I let it sit in vanguard at ~5% interest and keep saving?  If we did buy a new home, obviously we’d have to sell our current home and even take out a mortgage.  We are currently 100% debt-free.

RealEstate,down payment savings,How are people buying homes?,"I just got my pre approval, it is a lot lower than I expected. For context, I make $100k, have no debt, and have excellent credit. I have ~$170k earmarked for a down payment, and my pre approval came in for $440k. Nothing in my area , unless I want a studio condo, is any where near that range. I just don’t understand how anyone is expected to get into the market. My plan was to buy a duplex but that has been completely squashed. Ugh. I feel despondent. 


Edit: 
I touched base with the loan officer. She did not factor in potential rent. I had her factor in $2,500 mo. In rent. It bumped my loan amount up to $640k. Better, but for my area not great. It’s a lot easier said than done to move away from your family. I have several relatives that are very dependent on me and I am not willing to abandon them.

RealEstate,down payment savings,How on earth does one build any equity in the first 5 years of a mortgage if 87% of the payments go to interest?,"I'm struggling to understand. My partner and I have an expensive dream of purchasing 5-10 acres of land and living on it probably in a trailer as that's what we should expect to afford. Well, we can't afford that right now, but we CAN afford a regular house in town, even though we don't really want it. Our idea was to buy this home in town and live in it for about 5 years while building equity, then use the money from the sale for the home in town to finance land. But looking at the numbers, it seems like we wouldn't build equity at all. We'd just give the bank a lot of interest.

For the sake of examples, the numbers are as follows:

Home in town is $160k, requires only 3% down payment

Ideal ""dream"" land is going to cost $80k and requires a 20% down payment, plus a trailer for maybe another $20k, god knows what a well and septic will cost. Apparently it's really expensive to live how poor people used to.

Seems like we would only build $14k in equity after paying on the house in town for 5 years. I can save more than that while renting lol  

edit: i learned a lot from the handful of helpful people in here, mot of you are annoying and probably have weird personality disorders and a martyr complex and no relationship with your adult children. We broadened our location radius to see if anything more regular and finance-able was on the market that would fit our criteria for an ideal property that we'd want to spend the rest of our lives at around us in our price range and sure enough there is a handful. Our realtor is arranging showings for this weekend. I hope y'all aren't offended that we haven't suffered enough to deserve a showing or whatever weird issue yall have about people having the audacity to reach for what they want and the humility to ask for practical advice on how to do it lmao. And if those don't work out we'll just keep renting for now and building our savings that's fine too and i'm sorry to everyone who is gonna be offended that i'm fine with that ",118,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1jv9ckg/how_on_earth_does_one_build_any_equity_in_the/,1744214436.0,st_psilocybin,1jv9ckg,
